I do want to try and have a date with you as much as possible, but that doesn’t mean I’m not also worried about Kanata-kun! Really, I’m serious~♪</p><p>But honestly, I feel like it’s a little too early to start saying Kanata-kun’s gone missing.</p><p>It’s only been around a week since he took a break from school, right? And he hasn’t been going to Ryuseitai’s activities, either…</p><p>But that&#39;s all there is to it, right? He isn&#39;t a baby, so I feel like this is just worrying way too much over him.</p><p>I mean, he disappeared for a long time at the end of last year.</p><p>Huh? You didn’t know? He’s part of the Five Eccentrics—I think it’s just the Three Eccentrics now… He was that kinda person, so…</p><p>A lot happened to him back then. He may act like things don’t affect him, but he does go through a lot more than you might think.</p><p>But nowadays, it feels like he’s having fun every day.</p><p>So there wouldn’t be any reason for him to disappear… Maybe he’s not feeling well and took a break for his health?</p><p>His home is like, really protective of him, or something.</p><p>Either way… Just to make sure, my role is basically to find him and tell him to come back, right?</p><p>Or at the very least, you want me to ask him why he hasn’t been coming to school, right?</p><p>Okay then, but why me? I mean, I’m honored, but Kanata-kun already likes you quite a lot, Anzu-chan.</p><p>You can do it by yourself, can&#39;t you? I don’t need to be here.</p><p>It’s true that I&#39;m his friend, and I&#39;m also good at talking it out with people to some extent, so I <em>would</em> be suitable for something like this.</p><p>But soon enough, Ryuseitai will have a big job to do, so when that happens, they’ll want him back, right?</p><p>That&#39;s probably why you&#39;re helping out now, as a producer.</p><p>In that case, shouldn&#39;t Morisawa-kun be the one to take responsibility as the leader and talk to Kanata-kun?</p><p>Hmm… So that was your intention at first, but when you looked around for more info, you found out it may be related to his circumstances at home.</p><p>That’s when Morisawa-kun told you that I’d be better equipped to handle it.</p><p>I feel like he&#39;s overestimating me… I may be the son of a locally famous person…</p><p>And that does mean I have a deep connection with Kanata-kun&#39;s household, since they&#39;re rooted to this region&#39;s seaside…</p><p>But that&#39;s also exactly why it&#39;s gonna be really tricky for me to approach him about it.</p><p>For once I, of all people, was able to be friends with a guy, so I don&#39;t want to make things awkward between us because of family-related things.</p><p>…Ahh, but don&#39;t worry. I don’t think it’s going to be that serious this time around.</p><p>I’ll do everything you’ve asked of me. It&#39;s a favor from you, so I have to do it.</p><p>Besides, his most likely hiding spot is in the aquarium, so while we’re there I’ll get to act like I’m on a date with you.</p><p>Well, other than having a <em>child</em> coming along with us.</p></div></div><div class="msr-unit" character="Souma"><div class="msr-icon"><div class="msr-icon__wrapper"><div class="msr-icon__base"></div></div></div><div class="msr-name"></div><div class="msr-line"><p>I apologize for making you wait… Do I look strange in this?

If she collapses from all of this, then it will be a disaster no one could ever bear or benefit from.</p><p>However, after taking on a strong front and lecturing her harshly, I cannot suddenly take everything back.

I really thought you were going to talk to me about what’s happening with Kanata-san.</p></div></div><div class="msr-unit" character="Rei"><div class="msr-icon"><div class="msr-icon__wrapper"><div class="msr-icon__base"></div></div></div><div class="msr-name"></div><div class="msr-line"><p>Ahh, yes, Shinkai-kun also seems to be going through some problems.</p><p>Since I do not spend time with the Five Eccentrics as much as I used to, I do not know what is happening with him…</p><p>But he is an old friend. If danger befalls him, then I cannot sit by and watch. However, from the way I see it, what is happening at the moment is a <em>good</em> sign.</p><p>That child, bound by the circumstances of his home, and by the customs of this land… He is doing all of that on his own will—for his own selfish reasons. I would rather support him.</p><p>We should let him do as he pleases. After all, he&#39;s far too kind—so much that he always prioritizes making others happy.</p><p>But the modern age would not accept living a life like that of a sacrificial lamb.</p></div></div><div class="msr-unit" character="Madara"><div class="msr-icon"><div class="msr-icon__wrapper"><div class="msr-icon__base"></div></div></div><div class="msr-name"></div><div class="msr-line"><p>I agree with you. While I do think it&#39;s silly that we&#39;re trying to define someone else&#39;s form of happiness…</p><p>His form of happiness has never been world peace, or the prosperity of land—It&#39;s nothing ambitious like that…</p><p>Rather, it seems to be those trivial but valuable things, such as simply sitting together as a family, having tea.</p><p>After all, when we played house together, he&#39;d have the loveliest smile on his face from how happy he was—You almost wouldn’t believe it. Even though he&#39;d always say I&#39;m being annoying or that I’m bothering him.</p></div></div><div class="msr-unit" character="Rei"><div class="msr-icon"><div class="msr-icon__wrapper"><div class="msr-icon__base"></div></div></div><div class="msr-name"></div><div class="msr-line"><p><em>Kukuku.</em> Shinkai-kun may seem like nothing but a fluffball, but he can spout venom.</p></div></div><div class="msr-unit" character="Madara"><div class="msr-icon"><div class="msr-icon__wrapper"><div class="msr-icon__base"></div></div></div><div class="msr-name"></div><div class="msr-line"><p>Hahaha, so he&#39;s pretty much like a jellyfish, huh?</p><p>The venom stored in a sea creature’s body comes from absorbing all the nasty stuff in the water and the food it eats…</p><p>But Kanata-san, in truth, is a pure and kind creature.
