Birthday Quote
2016
Today is my birthday! If you weren&#39;t aware of that, then I&#39;ll keep telling you! Today is my birthday! ☆

2017
Hehehe, I&#39;ve been waiting for you to say that! I&#39;m so happy…! Your words touch me right in my heart…!

2018
Thank you! I have comrades who will celebrate my birthday—the day Morisawa Chiaki was born! I couldn&#39;t be happier than this…! ☆

2019
Thank you for celebrating my birthday! It makes me so happy to have my birthday celebrated, and I&#39;m all the more happy when it&#39;s by you…♪

Birthday Greeting
Uu… Uuu… (sobs) To think that this many people would celebrate my birthday… I&#39;m so, so fortunate to have thiiiiisss~!

Birthday Course
 1/3

The red flames are the mark of justice! Burning bright red, the sun of life!
Today&#39;s protagonist! Chiaki Morisawa!
Ha ha ha!! ☆ How&#39;s that?! Did I surprise you, Anzu?!


    
        
            U-Ummm…
        
        
			
				Possibility 1
				Possibility 2
			
			
            	Fuhahaha! Sorry for surprising you, Anzu!
However! I wanted to show off that it’s my birthday so that we can share the joy of this day~♪
Of course, I went to class looking like this, too! Everyone had pretty fun reactions to it~☆
                    

			
			
            	Heh, you&#39;re all surprised~♪
Your expressions are looking a lot softer lately, Anzu. I&#39;m glad I get to see lots of different kinds of faces from you.
It probably isn’t heroic of me to be happy over surprising someone, but it&#39;s my birthday! Forgive me this once!
                

			
        
    
	
        
            What are you doing?
        
        
			
				Possibility 1
				Possibility 2
			
			
            	Hmm…? You aren&#39;t reacting as much as I thought you would.
I feel like the temperature here slipped all the way down to the bottom… The only thing that could melt this frozen heart right now is a &quot;Happy birthday&quot; from you, Anz—
Hm?! What&#39;s wrong, Anzu? Your expression is hard to understand… It feels like things just got a lot colder now, you know?!
                

			
			
            	Today&#39;s my birthday, you see! So I&#39;ve been going around and telling everyone all about it!
I made my sash by myself. Earlier, when I was telling Takamine about my birthday, it fell off of me from moving around too roughly…
He was really shocked, saying &quot;What are you doing?!&quot;
Then he clipped the sash back on for me with a mascot character pin! Isn&#39;t that so touching?
                

			
        
    

 2/3

Aaaalright everyone! Pull yourselves together! Let&#39;s do this again!
Today&#39;s protagonist! Chiaki Morisawa! ☆
Yeah uh, sorry, Anzu. This was all prepared for me, yet I go and ruin that by not reading the mood…


    
        
            I won't forgive you.
        
        
			
				Possibility 1
				Possibility 2
			
			
            	Guh…! I-I suppose you wouldn&#39;t forgive me so easily…
Nagumo lectured me to be more like an adult, too.
But when I told him I&#39;ll try harder, he said he&#39;ll cheer me on. Mhm, that boy&#39;s future really is promising…♪
                    

			
			
            	Uuu…!! If you start hating me Anzu, I&#39;ll be… I&#39;ll beeeeeeeeeeeee…!!!
…You didn&#39;t say you hate me?
Ha ha ha!! ☆ So that&#39;s how it is! Thank you, Anzu! I love you too!!
                

			
        
    
	
        
            Please don't apologize.
        
        
			
				Possibility 1
				Possibility 2
			
			
            	Hm? It&#39;s the usual for me to not read the mood?
Hmm, I have mixed feelings about that. The truth is, Kiryu said something similar to me earlier…
I assume he meant it in a nice way, but somehow, I can&#39;t really be happy about it, I suppose…
                

			
			
            	Hnnn… You&#39;ll forgive me?! Thank you, Anzu!
…Hmm? You can&#39;t breathe?
Woops! Sorry! I was overcome with emotion and hugged you way tighter than usual! Fuhahahaha! ☆
                

			
        
    

 3/3
Bam! Are you alright, Anzu?! You&#39;re safe now that I, Ryusei Red, am here! ☆
Ahaha, my bad my bad! Sengoku suggested that we play hero, and it was a lot of fun, so I can&#39;t quite get myself to turn back.
Time just ends before you know it when you&#39;re having fun, huh?


    
        
            Do you have time after this?
        
        
			
				Possibility 1
				Possibility 2
			
			
            	Whaaat?! A-After this? W-w-w-wait, Anzu! I’m not mentally… prepared for th—
Hm? You&#39;re inviting me to stop by at a fast food restaurant with everyone?
Fuhaha! I see, I see! Of course that&#39;s what it was, right?! Aaalright, I&#39;ll treat you to french fries as thanks for today! ☆
                    

			
			
            	Hm? Akehoshi and Isara said that we should play basketball with everyone?
T-those guys, saying that… Even though they&#39;re the ones who always say they&#39;re too busy for club activities and barely come over for them… Especially Akehoshi.
Aaalrighty then! You&#39;re all going to be with me for the rest of the day! Let&#39;s shed the sweat of youth on our backs through the setting sun!
                

			
        
    
	
        
            Are you feeling lonely?
        
        
			
				Possibility 1
				Possibility 2
			
			
            	Ha ha ha! ♪ Don&#39;t say something Kanata would say, Anzu!
Yeah, he said that he&#39;ll celebrate my birthday next year as well, so I shouldn&#39;t worry!
He was saying it while doing his usual puka puka thing, so I&#39;m not sure how serious he is, but… I was really happy he said that.
                

			
			
            	Ahh, yeah… I&#39;d be lying if I said I wasn&#39;t.
But a hero always looks on the bright side! I&#39;m actually using this memory to fuel myself up…!
For the sake of protecting the peace of the world… and for everyone&#39;s smiles, I&#39;ll keep on burning my heart!
                

			
        
    

Birthday Story
Kanata
oh nooo~… someone please save me…♪
ehehe. you came to my rescue, chiaki. thank you.
yes, there are no problems here. i was simply doing an act.
specifically, an action scene of coming to the rescue in a cool way, and saving the victim. that&#39;s my present to you.
you&#39;re always so lively and energetic whenever you&#39;re being a hero, you see~…♪
hehe, please keep being just like that, chiaki. puka, puka…♪

Tetora
Taichou, is it true that you made that sash before it was time for your birthday party?
Oh jeez… I wish you&#39;d think a little more about this, like, you have to be a little more mature when it comes to this, y&#39;know? It&#39;ll give us problems otherwise.
Honestly… I mean, we&#39;ve celebrated everyone&#39;s birthday by now—did you really think we wouldn&#39;t celebrate yours?
If that&#39;s what you really thought, then you definitely need to work on this.
There&#39;s no way we wouldn&#39;t celebrate your birthday! You&#39;re our leader, so please keep that firmly in your mind!
…Here I am lecturing you on your birthday of all days… Hehe… I&#39;m sorry.
Please let me say the most important thing, at least! Happy birthday, Taichou…♪

Midori
Erm, Morisawa-senpai… Happy birthday…
Heheh, isn&#39;t it so cute…? Mhm, I&#39;m talking about the mascot pin I clipped on you…♪
Umm… Why do you look so happy? I wasn&#39;t complimenting you, y&#39;know…?
Ughh… I should&#39;ve never said &quot;cute&quot;… Actually, I shouldn&#39;t have given you that pin in the first place…
Could you give it back? Immediately, please… Um, no, don&#39;t refuse my request so desperately…
Huh…!? It&#39;s my present to you…? That wasn&#39;t at all why I gave it to you, though…?
Ahh, dammit, this is so annoying… Fine, whatever. Feel free to make it your birthday present… So please just leave me alone already…

Shinobu
Taichou-dono~! Happy birthday!
With this, we&#39;ve gone through every Ryuseitai member&#39;s birthday. It&#39;s just perfect that we end these celebrations with your birthday~♪
Erm, when it was my birthday party, we had fun being ninjas for the day, yes?
That made me extremely happy, and so… I would love to do something similar for your birthday, Taichou-dono.
And so! We will now play a hero game with everyone in here~! ♪
Hmhm. We have enough people to be the victims, the enemies, and the heroes.
Yaaay! Taichou-dono looks completely up for it~! Okay then, let&#39;s commence immediately!

Subaru
Chi~chan-senpai, happy birthday! I came here with Sarii~ to celebrate~☆
…Woah! I said I&#39;m here to celebrate, not &quot;get hugged by you&quot;!
Jeez. I can never let my guard down around you! It&#39;s still so hot, so why do you wanna hug me so much?
Is it &#39;cause you&#39;re born in summer that you don&#39;t feel the heat as much? Actually, you&#39;re exactly the definition of &quot;born in summer,&quot; don&#39;t you think?
No, no! That wasn&#39;t me complimenting you, y&#39;know!? Quit hugging me already~!
Oh come on, Chi~chan-senpai! I&#39;m here to celebrate your birthday, so sit down nice and quiet, and let me do it!

Mao
Buchou, happy birthday~♪
I think Anzu already invited you for it, but—do you still have time after this?
Would you like to go to a fast food restaurant with everyone? Subaru mentioned he wants to go home only after eating somewhere outside, so~♪
It&#39;s my present for you, so I&#39;ll be the one paying!
Uh-uh, I just knew you&#39;d say you wanna pay. But I&#39;m not backing down from my offer!
Well, guess we&#39;ve decided on the afterparty then~♪ We can&#39;t have an exciting party without the lead role, &#39;kay~?

Kuro
You look real excited, Morisawa. Are you that happy to play hero with so many people?
I never thought I&#39;d play pretend at a birthday party of someone my age… It&#39;d make sense if it were my sister&#39;s, but this is somethin&#39; alright…
Actually, you sure it&#39;s okay for me to play the hero? I mean, I feel like it&#39;s more suitable for me to be the big bad boss, or somethin&#39;…
Ah, so I&#39;d be too suited for that role and end up scaring the first years. Well, it&#39;s your birthday. I&#39;ll do it the way you like.
We&#39;re all planning to be here with you the whole day, anyway.
…Oh, I almost forgot to say somethin&#39; important. Happy birthday, Morisawa~♪

Madara
Chiaki-saaaaaaaan! Are you enjoying this wonderful special daaaaaaaay~? ☆
Though you showed up like that straaaight from the morning, so I&#39;m sure you are. I mean, even I was dumbfounded!
Izumi-san said he lost all will to celebrate, buuut he&#39;s just in a bad mood &#39;cause you ruined his plans, that&#39;s all.
Truth is, he was planning to throw a cake at you as soooon as you came to class, but you showed up in that outfit, so it would&#39;ve ruined it, yeah?
Well, doesn&#39;t mean he&#39;s given up entiiirely, though. I think you&#39;re just about to get the splat…? Haha, nope, I didn&#39;t say anything! Hahahahaha! ☆

Birthday Present

When gifting Chiaki a flower box…
Ohhh, a present from you, Anzu!? I&#39;m so happy, thank you! Let me hug you to show my gratitude~☆
Hmm!? No need to hold back, y&#39;know! Oh well. I&#39;ll place this flower box somewhere nice and safe alongside my tokusatsu merchandise the moment I return home! ♪

Birthday Cake

Shortcake (HAPPY)

The passionate red! The flames of red! I really can&#39;t help but be drawn to the red color! Burning bright red, it’s the strawberry of life…! ☆

Fruit Tart (GOOD)

Are you eating some as well, Anzu? Today’s my birthday, and so! I want you to have fun and enjoy yourself, too!

Chocolate Cake (OK)

S-So we’re having chocolate cake this time, okay… Alright, I can still fight some more! You prepared this just for me, so I’ll make sure to eat it all~…

Birthday Motion

Birthday Skill: Today is Chiaki's birthday. More passionately and energetically than anyone else, &quot;I'll do my best today, too!!&quot;

Birthday Story
With Kanata
happy birthday, chiaki~♪

Thank you, Kanata! I&#39;m so blessed to have my birthday celebrated by so many people!

hehe, that&#39;s because you&#39;re a hero. of course you&#39;d be popular~♪
my present to you is this huge fish. i&#39;m going to cook it up, so please wait a while.

Ohhh, that&#39;s amazing! I don&#39;t think I could eat it on my own. Let&#39;s eat it with everyone instead! Are you alright with that idea, Kanata?

of course~ let&#39;s show our gratitude to mister fish, and enjoy your birthday party…♪

With Tetora
Happy birthday, Morisawa-senpai!

Thank you, Nagumo! I&#39;m so happy you came! ☆

Ahaha, &#39;course I would! It&#39;s your birthday!
I&#39;m gonna work hard to become an even more super reliable, manly man! So I want you to watch over me, Senpai!

Oh…! Alright then! Your feelings of passion have touched my heart!
Right then, Nagumo! Let&#39;s continue sending out the heart of justice together! Fuhahahaha! ☆

With Midori
Hm? Oh, is that you over there, Takamine!? I knew you&#39;d come to my birthday party! Why didn&#39;t you tell me you were around? ♪

&#39;Cause I knew this&#39;d happen… Sigh, I knew I shouldn&#39;t have come…

Don&#39;t be that way! I&#39;m happy to see you here, y&#39;know!

Ughhh, please don&#39;t yell near my ear…

Aaalright, Takamine! Now that the five of us are all here, let&#39;s take a photo together to commemorate!

Whaaa…? Jeez, fine… It is your birthday today, so I&#39;ll go along with it.
Happy birthday, Morisawa-senpai…♪

With Shinobu
Happy birthday, Morisawa-dono~♪

Woah—! S-Sengoku!? I couldn&#39;t even tell you were nearby until you greeted me!

Heheh~ That&#39;s because I used my ninjutsu to sneak up on you~♪ I&#39;ve brought you a present, too.

Ohh! It&#39;s a headband! Wait, is this… the one that Ninja Red wore?

Indeed! I got this for you, because I thought you&#39;d also enjoy this type of ninja gear. I would like you to take it for yourself, if that&#39;s alright~♪

Thank you, Sengoku! I&#39;m going to take great care of it…♪

With Hiiro
Happy birthday, Chiaki-senpai. I&#39;ve come to celebrate!

Ohh! Thank you, Hero-kun!
I&#39;m so happy to know that even you&#39;ve come to my birthday party! This must surely be because an ally of justice would never pass the opportunity to celebrate their comrade&#39;s birthday! ☆

Hm? Yes, that&#39;s right! You are my comrade, and I&#39;m quite indebted to you. It&#39;s only natural that I would celebrate your birthday!
I also prepared a present, so please open it at a later time, if that&#39;s alright with you. I bought it from the shopping center, so it should hopefully not be anything strange…

Ha ha ha!! ♪ It&#39;s a present you bought just for me, so I&#39;ll be happy with anything! Thank you so much, Hero-kun…☆

Birthday Event (2021)
Event Preparations
 1/3

…Mhm, this should do! I’ll keep practicing the best options to do my role in the show until it’s time for it.
Thank you for helping me out today, Anzu! Alright, I should be going n—
Hm? There’s something else you need to tell me? What is it?


    
        
            It’s your birthday soon, isn’t it?
        
        
            Yep, you’re right! I’m so glad you remembered! But what about my birthday?
What!? You’ll have a birthday event for me!? That sounds like a blast!
            

        
    
    
        
            Would you like to do a solo event?
        
        
            I’d love to do that, but… what do you mean by that, exactly? What will I be doing?
Ahh, a birthday event? I never expected to get one for myself…! I’m so happy!
            

        
    
    
        
            I’d like to do an event.
        
        
            Oh, then I’ll ask Ryuseitai to join t—Huh? It’s only going to be me?
Ohhh, I get it now! You’re holding an event for my birthday? Yeah, the one my Ryuseitai comrades did. I was really looking forward to doing it, too!
            

        
    

 2/3
You get to play games and answer questions from fans in the birthday event, right?
If I remember clearly, Sengoku showed off his ninja techniques, and Nagumo had a work-out session with everyone…
I could tell it was super fun to share their hobbies and specialties with their fans!


    
        
            You know a lot about it, huh?
        
        
            Hehe, I heard all kinds of things about the event! I’ve actually already prepared a video for Takamine’s bir—
Ah—!!  ……Whew, Takamine isn’t around. I have to make sure I don’t spoil the surprise before his birthday.
            

        
    
    
        
            Did they enjoy it?
        
        
            I’m sure they did! Akehoshi was so happy about it, he bragged to me about how he got to do his birthday event first!
Also, Kanata’s pretty excited to do his once his birthday comes around~♪
            

        
    
    
        
            Do you have anything you’d like to do?
        
        
            Oh! So I can request for something too, huh… Hmm, let’s see…
I’d love to do a hero show! I want everyone to see the gallant figure of a hero who refuses to back down from terror!
            

        
    

 3/3
…Oh, so much time has passed. We sure talked a lot, huh? It’s getting late, so it’s best that you go home as soon as possible.
We’ve got a few more things to wrap up, so how about we talk it over another time?
I had a lot of fun today! Thank you, Anzu…♪


    
        
            Please look forward to the day of the event.
        
        
            Oh, you bet I will! I feel overfilled with burning excitement just knowing I’ll get to celebrate my birthday with my fans!
And now that we’ve talked it out, I’m even more excited for the event!
            

        
    
    
        
            Let’s make it a great event together.
        
        
            Yeah, we’ve got this! Let’s make it a wonderful event for all my fans!
I’ll be sure to give it my all! So let’s do this together, Anzu…♪
            

        
    
    
        
            I hope everyone makes some good memories.
        
        
            Mhm, I get you! I gotta make sure this event’s memorable both for me and my fans, right?
Don’t you worry, Anzu! It’s a hero’s duty to make everyone smile!
            

        
    



Opening Speech
Hey, everyone! Thank you so much for coming over to my birthday event!
I can’t even begin to describe how happy I am to see so many of you here, just to celebrate my birthday!
But! I don’t plan to make you all do the work! I’ve got a bunch of stuff prepared to get you all hyped up for my birthday!
We’ll only get to be together for a short while, but that’s why I want everyone to enjoy this as much as they can, so we can all make memories together!
Alright, are you ready? Let’s get things started!

Question Segment
Let’s start with the Question Corner! All your questions are on this card, so let’s get through them!
Right, first question! “Have you ever felt scared while doing your stunts?”
Hmm… It would’ve made me look cool if I said “absolutely never,” but I’ve had moments where I cut it too close. But don’t worry, everyone ends up being satisfied with the shooting once it’s all done and over with!
Alright, next question! “What makes tokusatsu shows so good?”
Great question! That’d of course be: the bonds betweens comrades! The passionate, deep friendships! And the courage of facing any and all hardships!
Oh, and I love how it’s always about justice prevailing no matter what!










Hover/Click the chibi to see the quote!
Request Segment
Next up: the Request Segment! Thank you for all your requests! The one I’ll be doing is… “I want to see your basketball skills”!
I wasn’t sure what to do for this, but I decided to start from the basics, which is dribbling! We’ve got some evenly-spaced cones here, so I’ll be dribbling through them!
…♪ All this dribbling reminds me of the days I’d play basketball with Akehoshi, Isara, and Takamine.
This is where you’re meant to get past the defense, and take the perfect layup shot!
—But sadly, I’d hurt someone if I actually threw the ball, so I’ll just demonstrate how it would look! ……Did you guys enjoy that?
This is commonly taught in school, so you might’ve already seen it before. I’d love it if you could try it out the next time you play basketball!

Surprise Segment
…Hm? The staff brought over a present box. May I open it?
Alright, I got the OK! Let’s go!
…Ohh? I got three cards filled with messages! The first one… is from Ryuseitai!
Can you guys see it from your seats? It says “Happy birthday” in the middle, with stars in our colors all over the card! It’s so cool!
I got another card from Sports Survivors, and the last one is from Shin Circle! They’ve all got such heart-warming messages written on them…!
Oh, I can’t hold back my happiness anymore! I feel so much warmth deep in my soul…! I’ll take my sweet time reading them later, and engrave their messages deep inside me…!

Closing Speech
Everything comes to an end, huh… I knew that already, but it’s still sad to need to say goodbye to everyone.
However! That sort of mood doesn’t suit me! Instead, I’m going to wish you all goodbye with a smile on my face, to the very end!
Thank you so, so much for today! I’m so happy I got to see so many smiles from everyone!
Your smiles and cheers is all it takes to push me a step forward!
I’ll keep working hard to the best of my abilities as a hero and an idol!
So please keep cheering for Ryuseitai! I hope I get to see you all again sometime!

Anzu! Are you enjoying yourself at my party?
Wh—You haven&#39;t eaten yet!?
Alrighty, let&#39;s go get some together then! I was just about to grab food for myself, so we could do it together! ♪

Whew, time to rest now that the party&#39;s over.
I got to enjoy my time chatting and laughing with friends, have a great feast, and receive blessings from people for all my hard work and growth… It&#39;s been such a wonderful day.
I feel further motivated to work hard as a hero, so that I could even protect such peaceful, joyful times as this!


    
        
            I'm cheering for you.
        
        
            Hearing you say that gives me courage!
I&#39;d love it if you could watch over me and support me from close-by. Is that alright, Anzu? ♪
            

        
    
    
        
            I'll support you.
        
        
            Thank you, Anzu. We&#39;ve only come this far because of all your support.
Ryuseitai will continue to protect everyone&#39;s smiles! So please lend us your strength as a fellow comrade, Anzu!
            

        
    



Opening Speech
Thanks for coming to my birthday party, everyone!
We don&#39;t tend to get many opportunities to gather all in the same place, so I really mean it when I say I&#39;m happy to see you all here…♪
And for that reason, I want us all to have a blast together!
Enjoy yourselves to your heart&#39;s content today! ☆ Alright, that&#39;s all I wanted to say!

Yoohoo, Moricchi! Happy birthday~♪

Thank you, Hakaze! Nothing makes me happier than being wished a happy birthday directly…♪
Oh yeah, I left some pancakes for you over there, so go ahead and eat them! You&#39;re free to add as much cream as you like, too! ☆

Woah, you remembered my favorite food?
That reminds me though, there were a lot of French fries prepared, too. It&#39;s your birthday and all, so eat up as much as you like.

Oh! So we both remembered each other&#39;s favorite food, huh? I truly feel our bond of friendship…☆

Ahaha, you&#39;re over-exaggerating… But hey, since it&#39;s your birthday party, let&#39;s eat together. We&#39;ll grab some drinks, too~♪

Presents from ES Idols
Wow, I didn&#39;t expect to be surrounded by so many presents…!
Everyone brought all these presents, just for me…! Uuu, I&#39;m getting so emotional just thinking about it…
Alrighty, I&#39;ll start by opening this one up!

That would be my gift. Happy birthday, Morisawa-senpai.

Ohhh!? This is yours, Otogari!? Is it meat? Tell me, is it meat!?

I would love to say yes, but I gifted you something else. It would have been difficult to prepare meat as a birthday present. I do hope you&#39;ll like it, however…

Alright, let me see… Ohh, a gym bag!? This&#39;ll come in handy for both Shin and Sports Survivors! ♪ Thank you, Otogari!

Birthday Wishes from ES Idols
Ah, there he is! Heeey, Takamine~!! ☆ Are you eating well~!?

Uuu… This is so embarrassing, I just had to have the main lead of the party yell out for me, and then start getting insanely worried over me in front of everybody… He&#39;s so insensitive…

Aw c&#39;mon, it just means that you&#39;re getting doted on by Morisawa-senpai, right?

Ohh! Isara, you were with Takamine!? I assure you that both of you are my adorable juniors! There, there, c&#39;mere~! ☆

Ahaha, your habit of hugging as soon as you can hasn&#39;t changed, huh?

Meh, I&#39;ll go along with it for today… Since you just love to goof off with your juniors no matter how old you get…

Time sure flies when you&#39;re having fun…
I told you all to enjoy yourselves to your heart&#39;s content, but I think I&#39;m the one who ended up having fun the most…
But I enjoyed myself this much because you were all laughing and having a great time! Your smiles were the best present I could have~♪
As both a hero and an idol, I&#39;ll work harder than ever for the sake of seeing your wonderful smiles on my next birthday! ☆

I&#39;m overjoyed with gratitude![1] Thank you, Sengoku~♪


It&#39;s only natural to celebrate my senior&#39;s birthday!

I got you a present. I&#39;m just hopin&#39; you like it.

No need to worry! I&#39;m happy enough to know you did that for me!


Let&#39;s play basketball on our next day-off!

Sounds like the perfect opportunity to have fun with our circle!


You&#39;re always helping me out, after all.

            	oh yes, actually. chiaki told me he was alright with giving me the center role for today~
he even asked me if i wanted to wear the red uniform, but i politely refused.
i&#39;m fine with blue, since i love it… and we all know ryuseitai&#39;s “taichou” is chiaki, so…♪

they were looking at me with sparkles in their eyes, so i got more into it.
this is a special day that only happens once a year, so i&#39;m a little more hyper than usual~♪
                

			
			
            	ahaha~♪ i&#39;m so happy to know it made everyone smile.

            	yes~ the sushi souma made was very delicious~♪
kaoru complained about it though, saying he would rather have your cooking.
but personally, i poured my beloved soy sauce all over it, and ate it all up… puka, puka…♪

				Possibility 1
				Possibility 2
			
			
            	yes, i was very surprised at how the rest of the five eccentrics arrived to the party.
it is so like them to come at me with water guns~
they were all enjoying themselves and having fun, and then we all got drenched wet… it was lots of fun~♪
                

			
			
            	ah, yes… i was very surprised to see the rogue here.
now that i think about it, i&#39;m not sure why i was—of course he&#39;d be part of a festival riot…
then he carried me up high in front of everyone… i&#39;ve grown a year older, yet i felt like a baby at that moment.
                

			
        
    

Birthday Story
Chiaki
Fuhahahaha! Happy birthday, Kanata!
Wow, so many people have gathered here just to celebrate your birthday…☆
Seeing you surrounded by your comrades and the children, and smiling so happily…! It makes me awfully emotional!
Sorry, sorry. I wasn’t planning on crying or anything, but I just got so into it. Ha ha ha~! ♪
Oh, uh, now you’ve pat me on the head… I’m here to show my gratitude and to celebrate your birthday, but I’m getting comforted by you instead…
Aaalright then! I have to redeem my honor right here! We’ll call over the Ryuseitai kids and perform a special live show together~♪

Tetora
Erm, okay. Shinkai-senpai, happy birthday!
Truth is, I, uh… always thought you were a weird person.
But now I really respect you as someone great like, I’m always thinking, “wow, as expected from someone of the Three Oddballs.”
And so, Shinkai-senpai! Please teach me about more and more stuff! I’d appreciate it!
Uoohh~?! You’re okay with it?! Thank you so much~!
…Hm? You’ll start by teaching me how to puka puka?
O-Ossu! I gotcha! I’ll puka puka like my entire life’s counting on it~!

Midori
Shinkai-senpai… I’m really sorry for forgetting your birthday…
I’m just awful, aren’t I… You came to celebrate my birthday yesterday… and even gifted me a cute mascot character plushie, I still went and forgot all about it…
Uuu, please don’t be kind to me… It’s fine, you can curse at me and hate me… I’m ready for it… I think…
Sigh… It’s your birthday of all things, and now I’ve ruined the mood with my moping…
I’m gonna make up for all of this, I swear… I’ll even buy you a present…
I really do wanna celebrate your birthday, so please accept my present once I’ve bought it… I’ll be really glad… Happy birthday, Shinkai-senpai…

Shinobu
Shinkai-dono! Happy birthday!
Are you enjoying the party we prepared for you?
If there&#39;s anything you wish to change about it, you can always inform me!
Heheh. I’m always in your debt, so I want to make you happy, even if just by a little bit.
Since there&#39;s the expression of “Mother Ocean,” you have somewhat of a motherly-feel to you within Ryuseitai, you see.
I’m still a novice compared to Tetora-kun and Midori-kun, but I’ll keep working harder and harder in order to show my respect and care for my seniors~♪

Kaoru
Kanata-kun, yoohoo~♪ Happy birthday~ Are you having a blast?
Hey, wait. I asked you earlier if you wanted to come with me to the ocean, but you refused &#39;cause it’s too hot to move! And now you came to this party when Anzu-chan asked you?
Although, I mean… if I were invited somewhere with her, I’d go without condition too, but…
It’s not like I was planning to surprise you with something, y’know~? I was just thinking of walking on the beach a little, so I invited you over as well~♪
Hmm? You’ll join me once the sun goes down and it starts to get cooler?
Ahaha, thanks. But for now, just enjoy your party. It’s not really like me to do this, but I’ll try and make things exciting here for you~♪

Souma
Happy birthday, Buchou-dono. Kanzaki Souma has now arrived.
I apologize for the sudden request, but may you please accept my present for you?
Last night, I prepared multiple types of sushi in order to make them for you! They are raw of course, so I would like you to eat them as soon as possible. ♪
Huh—? Have I made too many…? It has covered the entire “tay-bul”…
I was imagining your joyful face while making them, thus I ended up with this much before I noticed.
It is perfectly fine to offer it to the people gathered here. We will make this a sushi “par-tii”…♪

Wataru
Kanata! Happy birthday…! ☆
How joyful! We’ve managed to gather here for the sake of celebrating a dear, beloved old friend’s birthday~♪
Although, if we could just come to school properly, we would be able to see each other practically everyday, yes?
But let us leave that aside for now! I’ve prepared a present specifically for you. Please watch closely… One, Two, Amazing!
Yes, an inflatable pool. Please do use it and puka puka wherever you please, whenever you like! Fufufu!
It is an extreme honor to know it made you happy! There’s already water inside, so it’s completely alright to go ahead and soak yourself anytime~♪

Natsume
Kanata-niisan, happy birthday…♪
Sorry about Earlier. You were surprised to see us show ourselves with water guns in our hands, weren’t You?
Ahaha, I’m glad to know you enjoyed It. Cleaning this room will be hard work now that the whole place is drenched with Water, though…
But eh, you’re probably happy with it being this Way. Go ahead and try out the present from Wataru-niisan, too. For his Sake.
Fufufu. The rest of the guests here will be unhappy if you keep having fun with us Only.
I’ll be more respectful and keep it Down, and tell the rest of my niisans to do the Same. So just enjoy your day as much as you want, Kanata-niisan~♪

Birthday Present

When gifting Kanata a flower box…
puka, puka…♪ there are so many pretty flowers~♪ i&#39;m sure it&#39;d look even more beautiful if i laid them ontop of water~
ufufu, but since they&#39;re so fresh, i&#39;ll just keep them in a vase for now. thank you so much, anzu-san~♪

Birthday Cake

Fruit Tart (HAPPY)

there are a lot of fruits in different colors on this cake. it kind of looks like ryuseitai, doesn&#39;t it? ehehe…♪

Shortcake (GOOD)

i don&#39;t eat fruit and cake that much, but today is a special day. i&#39;ll have a bite~…♪

Chocolate Cake (OK)

this cake has a strange shape to it, doesn&#39;t it~? ahh, it&#39;s meant to look like a fish, i see~

Birthday Motion

Birthday Skill: Today is Kanata's birthday. With a heart that adores the ocean, and is as vast as one, &quot;i'll do my best today, too…♪&quot;

Birthday Quote
2016
Today&#39;s my birthday, and it looks like I didn&#39;t grow any taller, so I&#39;m glad… I&#39;m feeling kinda content…♪

2017
You&#39;re giving me a present…? It&#39;s even got mascot character merchandise… I&#39;m so happy…♪

2018
Ah, yes… Thank you very much… Having my birthday celebrated makes me kinda happy…♪

2019
Thank you for celebrating my birthday. Ah—No need to wear a mascot costume for me. I&#39;ll still be fine without it…♪

Birthday Greeting
Please look over here, there are so mascot characters…♪ Everyone knows me better than I thought they would… don&#39;t they?

Birthday Course
 1/3

A-Anzu-san… Hello. Do you have work to do as a producer today, even during the summer holidays?
Hm? Me…? I was asleep, but then Morisawa-senpai suddenly invaded my home…
Then he called out to me saying, &quot;I took your favorite pillow as hostage! If you&#39;re a hero, then come and save it!&quot;


    
        
            Ah, yeah… that’s a disaster.
        
        
			
				Possibility 1
				Possibility 2
			
			
            	Morisawa-senpai ruined one of my other favorite pillows before, too.
I&#39;ll never forgive him…! I have to protect my pillow this time…!!
…I&#39;m sorry. Please pretend you didn&#39;t hear that.
                    

			
			
            	Disaster doesn&#39;t even begin to describe how it—… The truth is, today&#39;s my birthday…
And my parents told me that I don&#39;t have to help out at the greengrocer for today, so I really thought I&#39;d be able to sleep as much as I like…
Siiiiigh… Why do I have to come to school, of all places…
                

			
        
    
	
        
            I know where he is.
        
        
			
				Possibility 1
				Possibility 2
			
			
            	Thank you, that&#39;d really help me… I don&#39;t remember ever becoming a hero or anything…
Actually, I can&#39;t believe he&#39;d do something like kidnapping… When he&#39;s the one who keeps calling himself a hero…
Hm? Why&#39;re you giggling? Did I say something weird?
                

			
			
            	So you know where he is?
…Hold on! Anzu-san, you can&#39;t possibly be aiming for that pillow too, right!?
N-no! That pillow&#39;s the only one I can never give away—even if it&#39;s to you!!
                

			
        
    

 2/3

You said you&#39;d take me to where Morisawa-senpai is, so I followed you, but… All of a sudden I have to wear this, too… Just what is—
Wait, now that I think about it, haven&#39;t I seen this sash before…?
Is it for a birthday party… Like, mine…?


    
        
            You don’t like this kind of stuff?
        
        
			
				Possibility 1
				Possibility 2
			
			
            	Ah, no, it&#39;s just—Pretty much the only people who&#39;ve ever celebrated my birthday before are my family.
This is the first time someone else has done something like this for me, so I&#39;m not exactly sure how to react…
Maybe birthdays aren&#39;t so bad, after all…♪
                    

			
			
            	Ah, it&#39;s not that I don&#39;t like it… But do I really have to put on this sash…?
Today&#39;s protagonist… I feel like it&#39;s a little too festive…
And the fact I have to stay looking like this for a while is so embarrassing… I wanna die…
                

			
        
    
	
        
            Everyone from Ryuseitai is here, too.
        
        
			
				Possibility 1
				Possibility 2
			
			
            	Ah, you&#39;re right… I feel a bit bad that everyone&#39;s here for someone like me…
So this is what they were secretly talking to each other about in practice the other day, huh…
I was really curious about it since I couldn&#39;t hear it at all… But I&#39;m happy to know that it was just to throw me a birthday surprise…♪
                

			
			
            	Is that so… Suddenly I feel a chill down my—
Ggh!? Morisawa-senpai is looking at me with the biggest grin on his face…
I’m sorry, Anzu-san, but I suddenly remembered something I gotta do, so can I go home…?
                

			
        
    

 3/3
Woah—!! I-I&#39;m so sorry!
Is that you, Anzu-san? I can&#39;t really see what&#39;s in front of me from all these presents…
There&#39;s so many… How am I supposed to take them all home with me?


    
        
            I have a present for you, too.
        
        
			
				Possibility 1
				Possibility 2
			
			
      
            	W-Where did this come from!? This plushie is sold out in every shop right now…
Huh? You made it yourself because you couldn&#39;t get hold of one? You&#39;re amazing as always, Anzu-san!

              
              Uwaaaah, thank you so much!! I&#39;ll cuddle it tightly when I sleep tonight…♪
                    

			
			
      
            	Huh!? I think I see something between all the presents…!!
Captain Kidoairaku…!?[1] Did you wear it just for me!?
Wai—I can&#39;t see what&#39;s in front of me! Wait a sec! Please stay looking like that for a little longer…!!!
                

			
        
    
	
        
            What's that package?
        
        
			
				Possibility 1
				Possibility 2
			
			
            	Ahh, this one&#39;s from Tetora-kun and Sengoku-kun.
They said they chose it together, and that it’s definitely going to make me happy, or something…?
They told me not to open it right now, so I can’t wait to do that once I&#39;m back at home…♪
                

			
			
            	It&#39;s a football fish plushie from Shinkai-senpai~♪ It&#39;s so cute and soft-looking…♪
Hm? What did I get from Morisawa-senpai?
…He gave me a load of tokusatsu DVDs and said, &quot;Do you like it!?&quot;
…Why would he think I&#39;d like this…?
                

			
        
    

Birthday Story
Chiaki
Today is your birthday, Takamine! Happy birthday, Takamine…! ☆
……
Hmm? No response? I don’t need one! I’m waiting right here with my arms wide open, so leap into my arms anytime!
“Why”? …Well, isn’t it more strange not to hug someone on the annual day of something this special?
I had a passionate embrace with Nagumo and Sengoku on their birthdays, so there’s no way I wouldn’t do the same with you! ♪
And so, without further ado! Come over, Takamine! If you won’t, I’ll do it myself~ Fuhahahahaha!! ☆

Kanata
fufufu. happy birthday~ midori~…♪
it&#39;s the summer holidays, yet so many people came over to celebrate your birthday. you&#39;re very blessed, midori.
it looks like you received many presents, too. when it&#39;s about you, the first thing that comes to mind is mascot characters, yes~?
the truth is, i also brought mascot merchandise for you. tadaaah, a football fish~…♪
i&#39;m glad to know you like it. it&#39;s always nice to get what you love, no matter the amount, yes? ehehe…♪
you look very happy being surrounded by your friends and mascots. i&#39;m also happy… puka, puka~♪

Tetora
Ossu! Midori-kun, happy birthday!
Heh, you’ve finally caught up with me and Sengoku-kun. Now we’re all the same age~♪
It’s not that big of a difference? I mean, that’s true, but…
You’re tall, so you look mature, yeah? But your birthday is after both of us, so…
Hehe! ♪ It feels like a good balance between the three of us!
Ah—But I wanna grow taller myself, so hmm…
Midori-kun, you don’t have to grow any bigger, ‘kay? Ooooh~!!! I’m gonna do my best to surpass you~! ☆

Shinobu
Happy birthday, Midori-kun~♪
Nishishi, our surprise party was a huge success~! You see, we&#39;d been planning for this day in secret~♪
Huh!? You noticed how we were whispering to each other about something?
U-Uuu~ I really should&#39;ve taken the initiative and hid everything from you… The ninja path is truly steep…
…“This is the first time people have celebrated my birthday like this, so I’m actually really happy”?
Wooo~! Midori-kun said he&#39;s happy! And he even smiled at me in a really nice way~!
Ahem. If you enjoyed it, then that&#39;s enough for me…♪

Subaru
Takamin, happy birthday~☆
Huh? Why do you look surprised? You were sparkling and smiling just a second ago~!
Yep, yep, you were smiling reaaally nice! I could never imagine the usual you doing that~♪
C’mon, smile like you were a second ago~ I loooved it~! ☆
Oh wait, right… Sari~ told me a bunch of stuff earlier. Stuff like, “don’t just say whatever comes on your mind”…
Was what I said just now alright? Tell me if it wasn’t, ‘kay? I don’t wanna ruin your birthday…
Imma get super pumped and have a blast so I can get to see you do that sparkly smile again~! ♪

Mao
“Takamine-kun, happy birthday-bon!”
Haha~ Yep, yep, it’s Basket-bon, the basketball fairy. I’m glad you still remember it.[2]
I thought doing this&#39;d make you smile, but I didn’t even need to worry about needing to do that, huh?
Your Ryuseitai pals and friends all came, and they’re having a real blast with you here.
I thought maybe I could also do a comedy skit with Subaru for you, although I&#39;m only expecting that to fail…… Hm? You wanna see it?
Wait, wait. So you want us to fail? …Wow, you really look like you wanna see this.
Alright, alright. I’ll do it just for you! You’re today’s protagonist, after all! Happy birthday, Takamine!

Tomoya
Takamine, today’s your birthday, right? Happy birthday~♪
“Thank you very much,” he says… Why’re you being so formal? We’re classmates, aren’t we?
Ahh, yep. I came here with Hajime, but… It’s not like I was against it, y’know?
I even bought you a present. Look, it’s mascot merch!
Of course I know you like this stuff. I’m pretty sure almost everyone in class knows you love mascot characters.
Don’t look so surprised and just take your gift, c’mon. Happy birthday, Takamine~♪

Hajime
Happy birthday, Takamine-kun…♪
I heard today was your birthday, so I came over to celebrate~♪
Wawa—Why are you bowing your head down in apology? Please, you don’t have to feel guilty about this~!
I didn’t come here because I had spare time during my summer break! I came because I wanted to celebrate your birthday~
Yes~♪ We are classmates, after all—I would love to get closer to you.
Ehehe. I hope we can get along once the next terms begins, Takamine-kun…♪

Birthday Present

When gifting Midori a flower box…
Huh? You&#39;re giving this to me…? Um, no, it&#39;s just—I didn&#39;t expect to get flowers…
Ahaha, they&#39;re so pretty… This is soothing in its own way. Thank you very much, Anzu-san…♪

Birthday Cake

Fruit Tart (HAPPY)

Hehe, it looks so tasty…♪ I don’t dislike fruits. I mean, I’m the son of a greengrocer, after all…

Shortcake (GOOD)

I like how shortcakes look… Don’t they kinda look cute? I wonder if there’s a shortcake mascot somewhere out there…

Chocolate Cake (OK)

Anzu-san, what kind of cake do you like? I just realized I’ve never asked you before…

Birthday Motion

Birthday Skill: Today is Midori’s birthday. Surrounded by passionate and lively people, “I’ll do my best… at least for today…”

Birthday Quote
2020
Uwaah, thank you for doing all of this for me…! You even prepared a mascot-themed cake for my birthday~♪

2021
I didn’t expect so many people to celebrate my birthday. I’m honestly surprised, but I’m really happy…♪

2022
Thank you so much…♪ I think I grew a little bit more this year.  …and I don&#39;t just mean my height.

Party at the Agency (2020)
 1/3

Ahh, it&#39;s already my birthday… Time sure flies…
I&#39;ve been at everyone else&#39;s birthday parties, so I was more or less prepared for this to happen, but…
It still feels kinda embarrassing. We&#39;ve got Shinkai-senpai&#39;s birthday to celebrate tomorrow, so how about we call it a day instead…?


    
        
            Happy birthday!
        
        
			
				Possibility 1
				Possibility 2
			
			
            	Thank you very much. I&#39;m sorry for being rude, especially when you took the time to prepare everything for me…
I mean, I&#39;m happy that I get to celebrate my birthday here, but… I feel bad that you&#39;ve prepared this much for me…
—No, I shouldn&#39;t think negatively about this… right? I&#39;ll be sure to enjoy the party.
                    

			
			
            	Ahaha… You saying that with a smile on your face stopped me from getting any more negative.
Thank you so much for preparing this all for me.
Birthdays happen only once a year, so I&#39;ll make sure to avoid saying anything negative for the day.
                

			
        
    
	
        
            Did you not want a party?
        
        
			
				Possibility 1
				Possibility 2
			
			
            	Ah—I&#39;m sorry. It&#39;s not that, I&#39;m just nervous, really…
I never have anything interesting to say—What am I gonna do…
I don&#39;t have to say anything interesting…? Y-You sure…?
                

			
			
            	No! That&#39;s not what I meant. It&#39;s just—It feels nerve-racking to have your birthday party at an agency…
Ahh, but I really need to stop moping like that… It&#39;d be rude to everyone who came over to celebrate.
Now that the party is here and ready for me, I&#39;ll just enjoy myself for the day.
                

			
        
    

 2/3
Ah, Miss Producer. Thank you for your hard work today.
That&#39;s a large box you&#39;re holding. Would you like help carrying it?
It&#39;s full of presents for me…? I&#39;ve gotten so many by now, who could they be from?


    
        
            From someone in RhythLink…
        
        
			
				Possibility 1
				Possibility 2
			
			
            	Ahh, from Tenma-kun? There&#39;s a bunch of bread in here.
He told me about how tasty this bakery&#39;s bread was a few days ago. I think I&#39;ll eat it with everyone now that we&#39;re all here together.
Hehe, they all look so tasty—I dunno what to eat first.
                    

			
			
            	Wha—From Hasumi-senpai?
He told you to give it to me &#39;cause he might be late to the party, huh…?
He&#39;s very diligent about these things, isn&#39;t he? But I&#39;ve been getting along with him lately at the Manga Club, so I&#39;m happy to get a present from him~♪
                

			
        
    
	
        
            They're from Gardenia.
        
        
			
				Possibility 1
				Possibility 2
			
			
            	Ooh, from Gardenia? I&#39;ll have to thank them the next time I show up at the club.
…Huh, there&#39;s some ominous flowers mixed in with the others. Who picked this one out…?
It says &quot;Enjoy as a hot driNK&quot; on the birthday card. This is just getting more cryptic…
                

			
			
            	This is such a pretty bouquet. Ah, there&#39;s a birthday card attached.
It&#39;s from Shino-kun. &quot;Happy birthday&quot;… His hand writing is as soothing as his presence is~♪
I&#39;ll have to thank him later. Thank you for handing it to me, Miss Producer.
                

			
        
    

 3/3
Thank you for your hard work, Miss Producer.
Haah, it&#39;s finally over… It&#39;s waaay easier celebrating someone else&#39;s birthday over your own.
I&#39;m really just not made to be the main role of anything…


    
        
            You're always the main role.
        
        
			
				Possibility 1
				Possibility 2
			
			
            	Ahaha… You almost sounded like Morisawa-senpai there.
But… you&#39;re right. I have juniors now, I need to make sure to be in the spotlight more.
I can&#39;t call myself a &quot;main role&quot; of anything yet… but I don&#39;t think my old self could&#39;ve ever imagined me being this positive about my future.
                    

			
			
            	You&#39;re not the type to just flatter someone… right?
Everyone is a main role to you, in their own way? I should have more confidence in myself?
Hehe, thank you very much. Hearing you say that made me think a bit more positively.
                

			
        
    
	
        
            You looked like you had fun.
        
        
			
				Possibility 1
				Possibility 2
			
			
            	I did enjoy it, but now I&#39;m dead tired.
I&#39;m sure it&#39;s rough for you, too. You&#39;ll have to prepare the next birthday party as soon as you&#39;re done cleaning up after this one, right?
Tomorrow&#39;s Shinkai-senpai&#39;s birthday, so I&#39;ll help you out. I&#39;m good at labor work, so…
                

			
			
            	Haha… Yeah, I did have fun.
Ever since I joined the agency, I haven&#39;t been able to hang out with everyone in Ryuseitai outside of work as much.
Tetora-kun and Shinobu-kun looked happy about it too—I&#39;m so glad… Thank you so much for making this party for me.
                

			
        
    

Birthday Story
With Chiaki
Fuhahahaha! Takamine, happy birthday!

Ugh—S-Stay away from me…!

What&#39;s up, what&#39;s wrong? Why&#39;re you stepping away from me? That&#39;ll make me feel lonely, Takamine…!

You hugged Tetora-kun and Shinobu-kun on their birthdays, didn&#39;t you…? I&#39;ve been dreading the day you&#39;d do the same to me…

Ohhh, I get it now! You wanted me to hug you, didn&#39;t you? I&#39;m sorry for not noticing sooner! Well then, here I go—squeeeze~♪

No, I&#39;m trying to say the opposite here—Ahhh, jeez, you&#39;re so suffocating…!

With Kanata
midori~ happy birthday.
i brought you that thing you&#39;ve wanted for so long…♪

The Kanatee plushie that was only sold on Marine Day!? It sold out five seconds after release and was gone just like that…!
C-Can I really have this for myself?

yes. that&#39;s why i brought it, after all. i found the very last one of it laying deep in the storehouse. please give it lots and lots of love, okay?

The last one…? Thank you so, so much. I&#39;ll be sure to treasure it…♪

With Tetora
Happy birthday, Midori-kun!

Thank you… Isn&#39;t this rough for all of you..? I mean, Shinkai-senpai&#39;s birthday is literally the day after mine.

Huh? Why would it be? There&#39;s no way we&#39;d have a rough time when it comes to birthday celebrations.
I&#39;m actually happy! &#39;Cuz I get to tell you happy birthday from the bottom of my heart!
Keep tomorrow&#39;s plans for tomorrow, and for today, let&#39;s celebrate your birthday with all we&#39;ve got~!

&quot;All we&#39;ve got&quot;…? Ahaha, you sure are full of energy, Tetora-kun.

With Shinobu
Midori-kun, happy birthday! I&#39;m so happy we get to celebrate your birthday together again~♪

Mhm, me too… Though I&#39;m still not used to celebrating it outside of my family…
But I think I feel relaxed, since I know practically everyone here—Like, it doesn&#39;t feel too bad being here, I think…
Ah, that&#39;s right… The producer made the cake for me. It&#39;s got Ryuseitai&#39;s colors on it…
I can&#39;t eat it all on my own, so let&#39;s eat it with everyone.

Yes, let&#39;s! I&#39;ll go prepare the plates and call everyone over!

With Tatsumi
Happy birthday, Takamine-san. May light shine upon your future. Amen. ♪

Wow… It feels really genuine when it&#39;s said in a form of a prayer.
Ah—I&#39;m so sorry. I think I was being rude there, wasn&#39;t I…?

Oh, never. I would be rather glad to know if you felt a connection with it. Religious faith was never something to be afraid of.
We may spend time together at Gardenia, but I still don&#39;t know you particularly well yet. I hope that we will be able to deepen our bond in the future.

Ah, yes… If you&#39;re fine with talking to me, then I&#39;d be glad to.

Birthday Event (2021)
Event Preparations
 1/3

Umm… After this, I’ll have to try out the outfits for tomorrow, and then…
…Sigh. I showed up to the practice session today, but I have a photoshoot for a magazine tomorrow… again? I’m grateful for these jobs, but I really miss veggies…
Ahh, Anzu-san, hello. I hope work has been going well… Is there something wrong?


    
        
            I have something to talk to you about.
        
        
            You wanna know what I’ve got planned for the end of this month? Well… I guess I’m free?
Huh? An event to celebrate my birthday? Umm… You don’t have to go that far for me, though…
            

        
    
    
        
            So you miss vegetables?
        
        
            I’ve been so busy the past few days… I know it’s a good thing, but I kinda wanna do something else for once…
Ah, that doesn’t mean I won’t be working hard at my job. I’m doing what I can, so… yeah, you’re free to talk to me about anything related to work.
            

        
    
    
        
            Look at the plans of this project.
        
        
            Plans… Does that mean it’s a new job for me? …No, wait, I’m an idol, so of course that’s what it’d be…
Huh!? A birthday event for me? I did hear about Tetora-kun and Shinobu-kun doing that, but one for me as well…?
            

        
    

 2/3
Umm, please hold on for a moment. When you say my own birthday event… Do you mean one where I’m the main lead?
I’m just a regular ol’ highschool student, and I’m still not even comfortable having my photo taken in public…
And do people really wanna see me do it that badly…? What am I gonna do if I fail…. Ahhh, this is so depressing, I wanna die…


    
        
            Look at this.
        
        
            Ah—that’s the keychain strap of that trending mascot character, right? I remember it being advertised… Are you giving it to me?
It’s themed after veggies, so it soothes me just by looking at it… I’m sorry about earlier, I feel a lot calmer now.
            

        
    
    
        
            It’ll be okay!
        
        
            I’ll be receiving requests and questions from my fans, so I don’t have to come up with my own topics…?
Ahh, I see. I shouldn’t end up disappointing anyone that way, then. That puts my mind at ease.
            

        
    
    
        
            You’ve got this!
        
        
            Uuu… You’re right, if I said I’d work hard as an idol, then I have to do this…
I’ll study up on what you’re supposed to do in talk shows until the event starts.
            

        
    

 3/3
Ah! I should go to my next meeting, I have to check up on the outfits… I’m so sorry to have made you explain so much for me.
…Um, you said I could ask you if I wanted to do anything in the event, right?
Since it’s a special event and all, could I have more time to think about that? I’ll tell you if I think up something.


    
        
            Let’s make it fun for everyone.
        
        
            Yeah, it would be rude of me to make it so boring when they came all the way for me.
…Ughh, can I really entertain everyone on my own…? I’m starting to get anxious about it all over again…
            

        
    
    
        
            Yeah, I’ll think stuff up too.
        
        
            I appreciate it, but… it’s been pretty hot lately, so please don’t overwork yourself.
It’s horrible going through a heat stroke, y’know? Please make sure to rest well. …Sigh, why’d I have to be born in such a sweltering hot time…
            

        
    
    
        
            Of course!
        
        
            Thank you. I don’t think I’ll come up with something as good as you would, but… I’ll think of something.
I wanna make everyone who wants to celebrate my birthday happy, even if only a little.
            

        
    



Opening Speech
Umm… Thank you for coming over to my birthday event, everyone.
I didn’t expect so many people to come, so… I’m pretty nervous, honestly.
I doubt I’ll be able to host this event properly… so please excuse me if my mind goes blank midway into the event.
Ahaha… Thank you for cheering me on. As a hero, I have to work hard for all the cheering I get.
I’ll be answering the questions and requests you all sent today.
I hope you can enjoy this the whole way…

Question Segment
First up is the question corner. I still don’t know what questions I’ve gotten, so I really hope it’s something I can answer…
Umm? “Midori-kun, your home is famous for being a greengrocer, so do you have any vegetables you recommend for summer?”
Hmmm… The seasonal veggies are full of nutrition, so I definitely recommend them. For summer, that’d be tomatoes, okura, and natto.
You can even grow these in your own garden, so it might be nice to try it out at home.
Next up… “Which mascot character are you crazy about the most right now?” Hmm… That’s a tricky question.
Mm… I can’t not say Kanatee, but the veggie mascot that shows up in commercials is super cute, too… I can’t choose one, sorry…










Hover/Click the chibi to see the quote!
Request Segment
Alright, now it’s the request corner. Thank you for all your requests, everyone.
First one is: “Please say your Ryusei Green catchphrase!”. This was the most requested one, surprisingly. Aren’t I always saying it?
…Alright then, here I go! “The green flames are the mark of compassion! The great nature, growing infinitely! Ryusei Green, Takamine Midori!”
Ahaha, it’s kinda embarrassing to do it without the rest here… But I hope it made you all happy.
Next is… “I want to see you do your handstand technique!”. …Wow, you know a lot about me. Did I ever talk about that being my specialty?
…Is it really that interesting to see me do a handstand?
Oh well, I’ll do it then. Here goes—

Surprise Segment
Next request is… Wait, huh? The screen went dark…
Wh—M-Morisawa-senpai? What’s going on!? Hey, wait! You&#39;re too loud and close to the screen!
Whaa… Now people are yelling in the background that Morisawa-senpai started the video too early…
Ahh, you guys wanted to tell me happy birthday together?
I didn’t know you guys were planning that at all. So even Tetora-kun, Shinobu-kun, and Shinkai-senpai gathered together to celebrate my birthday, huh…?
You caught me by surprise, but I’m really glad to know that you wanted to do that for me.

Closing Speech
I almost forgot this event was gonna have to come to an end…
I was so nervous when we first started, I’m really sorry about how I acted at first. I actually wanted to leave immediately.
But now… I just wanna talk to you guys some more. That’s how much fun it was.
It’s surreal to have my birthday celebrated by people other than my family and friends… and to even have them cheer me on.
But it really, really made me feel better. Whenever I’m having a hard time at work or in my photoshoots, I’ll remember everything that happened today and keep on going.
I’m still a novice hero, but… I’ll be working hard to grow as Ryuseitai’s Ryusei Green, so please do watch over me~♪

Party with Everyone (2022)
Party Event
 1/3

(Hmm… Anzu-san only called for me here, so I&#39;m betting it&#39;s gonna be for the birthday party…)
(But what if it isn&#39;t that…? I&#39;m gonna be so embarrassed if I&#39;ve actually got a lecture coming for me…)
Umm, excuse me, Anzu-san. Did you need me for something…?


    
        
            Here you go.
        
        
            Oh, you&#39;re giving me this bear…? So it was about my birthday party after all…♪
I was really worried you were gonna scold me, so I&#39;m glad… The bear is adorable, thank you so much…♪
            

        
    
    
        
            I wanted to give this to you.
        
        
            Oh, the bear that the birthday idol gets, right? I actually wanted one of my own ever since I heard about it…♪
It&#39;s not a mascot or anything, but I love how fluffy and cute it is…♪ Thank you, I&#39;ll take good care of it.
            

        
    

 2/3

Ah—Anzu-san. I&#39;m so sorry, I couldn&#39;t get the chance to talk to you from how busy the party has been.
I&#39;m the &quot;main protagonist&quot; for today, so I thought I should actually put in the effort…
Uu… But I&#39;ve been so nervous that I&#39;ve barely eaten anything… I&#39;m starving…


    
        
            Would you like something to eat?
        
        
            Yeah, I&#39;d like that. I&#39;ll go fetch something to eat.
I&#39;m excited to try the food out, I heard they used our greengrocer&#39;s veggies…♪
            

        
    
    
        
            Would you like to eat this?
        
        
            Ah—You brought me a plate? Thank you so much…♪
Waah~! I love this kinda food…! Thank you, I feel a weight off my back somehow…♪
            

        
    

 3/3
Whew, it ended safely somehow…
I hope people weren&#39;t bored with my party, though…
What do you think, Anzu-san…? Was it fun…?


    
        
            It was perfect! I'd give it 100 points!
        
        
            Huh!? You don&#39;t mean 100 points out of 1000, right…!?
I know I can trust your words, so… I guess I can gladly say I enjoyed today…♪ Thank you so much for what you&#39;ve done for my party.
            

        
    
    
        
            Everyone looked like they were having fun!
        
        
            I&#39;m glad to hear that.  …Yeah, now that I think about it, everyone was smiling around me.
I also had lots of fun celebrating my birthday with everyone… I&#39;m so happy…♪
            

        
    



Opening Speech
Ummm, thank you all for coming here today…
To be honest, I feel sorta bad to have so much prepared just for me… But I enjoyed everyone else&#39;s birthday parties, so…
I&#39;d like to make sure you all enjoy mine just the same, instead of regretting coming by… so I hope you enjoy yourselves here…
(…Uuu… Maybe I&#39;m being way too self-conscious by thinking they&#39;re all here just for my sake… I&#39;m so embarrassed…)
(But I think it should be fine to admit it, just for today… After all, everyone prepared this just for me, so I gotta show confidence in myself for once…!)

Chapter 1

    Location: Classroom 1-B


(Munch, munch)…♪
Mmm, tasty~ The cookies Yuuta-kun gave me as a “little early White Day gift” are simply delicious…♪
It’s so hot and spicy from all the chili peppers and ginger, that it almost made me wonder if he hates me enough to gift these as a means to torment me—
But it’s warming my body inside out~…♪
It is still a little chilly, so this is a huge life-saver. Mhm, this is Yuuta-kun’s way of caring for me!
I must prepare a gift for him as well before White D—Mmm?
A ruffian…!

Ah— Anzu-dono!? I-I-I deeply apologize for my mistake…!
I felt someone sneaking up behind me and assumed it was a ruffian — That is why I flung the cookie at you!
Ermm, umm… Y-You see, that was my White Day gift to you! ♪
…W-Was that a bad excuse? Are you angry, Anzu-dono?
Please say something! Staring at me without saying a word is terrifying~!

Um, erm… A-As an apology, you’re welcome to tease me!
You used to pinch my cheeks at random, did you not?
While you haven’t done it for a long time now, you seemed to like doing it!
I was very rude to you, so I accept it as my punishment…!
Anzu-dono? Are you alright? You don’t seem well…

Ohhh~? You’re suddenly squishing my cheeks…!? Is this my punishment!? Is this my divine retribution~!?
Uuu~? It doesn’t hurt, but the way you’re just silently doing it to me is terrifying!
…Sniff. Anzu-dono, now that that’s settled, I must ask… Did you have some business in Classroom 1-B?
Our lessons and homeroom class both ended a moment earlier, so there is no longer anyone around.
As I am on day duty today, I spent all my time wiping the blackboard clean.
I grew hungry however, and thus snacked on a few cookies while performing my duty.

Ah, you see — today, my classmates and I had a White Day gift exchange party.
However, it was very sudden, and I’m unaccustomed to friendly events—
So I felt extremely embarrassed that I hadn’t prepared anything. I ended up only being on the receiving end.

I shall definitely redeem myself from this embarrassment! I plan to go and find a gift for everyone after I’ve finished my duties in school.
Of course, I will also give something to you too on White Day, so don’t worry~♪
Hm? Ahhh, yes, there has been no activity in Ryuseitai lately, so I have the time to spare.
Hweh? That is what you’ve come to ask me about?
Hmmm… Although you are not in charge of producing the upcoming Repayment Festival…
You are helping around the place because you have nothing else to do.
That’s wonderful, Anzu-dono, thank you for all your hard work~. Hmm, so there are some powerhouse units that have yet to apply for the Repayment Festival?
It may have an impact on the number of visitors, so you’ve come to ask each unit how they’re doing…
Ah, Isara-dono asked you to do this? Hm, hm! I understand the situation now.

Isara-dono has been much busier these days, hasn’t he?
He is now the one who must manage everything as the leader of the Student Council, starting with Repayment Festival.
I have also been helping him out with a few trivial tasks! I owe a debt of gratitude to Isara-dono, so I would go through fire and water for him! ♪
Wawa— Please don’t pat me on the head while saying, “good boy, good boy. ♪”…
You’ll mess up my hair~ You tend to see me as a toddler, Anzu-dono…
Anyway, hmm… since Ryuseitai has not applied to participate in the Repayment Festival—
You’ve come to us to see if we intend to participate.

But why my class…? I am of low-rank in the unit, so I wouldn’t know anything.
Hmm… You checked Class A, but nobody was there?
I see… But if we don’t do something soon enough, it will be the day of the festival before we know it.
We are late enough as it is, and may not even have enough time to practice our performance.

Mm~… I am, however, fully willing to perform in the Repayment Festival.
The festival seems to have a lot of weight in it, as it is intended to be a repayment to all the seniors who have helped us.
And I have gained a lot all thanks to Taichou-dono and Shinkai-dono.
I owe them more than I could ever repay. I would at least like to reassure them by showing them that we have grown up splendidly.

As for the other two first-year members, however… Tetora-kun and Midori-kun seem to be conflicted about Repayment Festival.
It feels like a topic that must not be mentioned.
No, I don’t know the reason why, either.
We don’t share the same class, nor do we personally meet up other than for our unit activities.
We haven’t had any gatherings for Ryuseitai these days, and we’ve hardly been talking to each other.
Uuu… I also thought it was strange, so I tried to build up the courage to phone call or talk to them whenever we met in the corridors, but…
I feel like they are somewhat avoiding me…

D-Did I do something to make them dislike me?
Uwaaah~! Did I push all the wrong buttons without realizing it~!?
Both of them are precious allies that I fought alongside for a year. I cannot cope with the thought of them hating me…
That is why I could no longer even speak to them, as I did not want them to grow annoyed with me…
To be honest, I am at a loss… W-What should I do, Anzu-dono?

Chapter 2

    Location: Corridor 1-F (White Day)


Ohh, they’ve decorated this area for Repayment Festival already~♪
It really does look like another version of Chocolat Fes.
They changed the colors of the heart-shaped balloons~ The blue and white base color give a mystical[1] vibe~♪
But Repayment Festival is in two weeks, so won’t the balloons run out of helium by the time of the event…?
Did someone get ahead of themselves and place them early…?

Fufu… I think, because the Repayment Festival is an event mainly prepared by underclassmen, everything looks so amateurish and awkward.
As a DreamFes, it’s practically the same as the festival that was held the other day, Chocolat Fes.
Even if all they need to do is follow the setup of that festival, it’s still a little difficult to accomplish.
Hmm… Since the underclassmen are inexperienced when it comes to event planning, the setup remained the same as Chocolat Fes?
I see, so it is not because the academy is out of ideas or anything.
As for the changes — Unlike Chocolat Fes, the sweets for the customers in the Repayment Festival are not made by idols, but by the suppliers instead…
Well, that makes sense. We had more customers than expected at Chocolat Fes, so we were all too busy making sweets~
So that is why some areas have been revised, in order to tackle those problems better this time.

Ehehe, it was fun making sweets with everyone in Ryuseitai. We made such a huge ruckus!
But as everyone expected, Tetora-kun caused a small fire in the kitchen—
And Shinkai-dono manufactured a bizarre concoction, saying that “it’s edible euglena~♪”
But it was still sooo much fun…♪

To think that… we will never be able to have such fun as the five of us together, ever again… It makes me feel very lonely inside.
Hehe… I shouldn’t speak in such a somber manner, even if it’s hard to hold back because of graduation season…
This is our last time together, so I would like to send off my seniors with a smile and start walking toward the future.

For that reason, I would like to participate in the Repayment Festival, with a proper performance and everything.
But if we continue as we are now, I have a feeling that we will wander into a dark direction… We must band together as one.
Even if we will not be able to say “The five of us are Ryuseitai”—
It’ll be alright… There have been many three-man hero sentai squads in the past.
Heh! I also know a little bit more about heroes now, don’t you think? ♪


    Location: Dojo


…………

Ah— There you are, Tetora-kun! I’m coming in, okay~…?
So you really were in the dojo after all! Tetora-kun’s known for karate, and karate can only mean the dojo!
Were you meditating[2] again~?

Shinobu-kun.

Ah— Sorry. Sengoku-kun, didja want somethin’ from me?

Wh— Why did you correct yourself… You can call me “Shinobu-kun,” you know?

Actually, I have always called you by your first name, but both you and Midori-kun call me by my family name! It feels so lonely~!
Do you dislike me after all? Are you keeping your distance from me~!?

Ahaha, sorry. Sengo—… Shinobu-kun, I thought maybe you don’t like it when people get close with ya.
I’m also pretty thickheaded and clumsy, so~ I couldn’t figure out the right timing to change the way I call you. I’m sorry if it made you feel alienated.

N-No, it’s perfectly alright… Erm, is it just me, or have you grown up since the last time we saw each other…?

Huh? You think so? Well, a lotta things happened the past few days, like the Dragon King Competition[3]… I’m gonna be a second-year student soon, so I gotta grow up a li’l.

That’s not fair! You dashed up the stairs to adulthood without me!
I have a complex about being childish, so I’ve always wanted to achieve the look of an adult, just like you~!

Ahaha, we all walk at a different speed, y’know.

Ahh, you see!? You’re saying something so mature! It’s not fair~! You’re getting a head start~!

Ehh~? What’s wrong, Shinobu-kun…? You’re real clingy today… Didja have somethin’ to talk to me about?
I see that Anzu-Anego’s with you, too. Ah— Did you come to ask if we’re planning to participate in the Repayment Festival?

Whoa, you’re even getting better at guessing… For real, Tetora-kun, what happened to you?

Ahaha. Well, I just thought that it’s time I graduate from being a spoiled kid.

Anyways, ossu — thank you for checking on us… Anzu-Anego.
I’m sorry to say this after you came all the way here to the dojo, but… Ryuseitai isn’t in the proper condition to perform unit activities right now.
We’ll have to withdraw from participating in the Repayment Festival. It’s ‘cuz of our own personal reasons, but — I’m really sorry…

Chapter 1

    Location: Student Council Office


Pardon my intrusion!

pardon my intrusiooon~…♪

Mm, this is an intrusion, alright… You ought to mind your manners a little.
Can’t you at least be more gentle when you open and close the door? Now all the papers are scattered on the floor from the wind pressure.

Ohh, sorry! I’ll pick them up, I will! ♪

i’ll pick them up, i will~…♪

Hm? Huh, I only called Chiaki over… I wasn’t expecting you to show up as well, Shinkai-kun. What a wonderful surprise.
Fufu, I often spot you in the fountain, so it feels out of place to see you casually walking around the school. ♪

um~ am i an unwanted guest?

Not at all, you’re more than welcome to join. …Come over here, both of you. ♪

…? What’s the matter? We picked up all the documents!
They may be out of order, but I avoided looking at the contents because there might’ve been some classified information!

You’re an honest one, aren’t you? I wouldn’t have confidential documents around when I’m inviting someone over, you know.
Anyway, come on now. Isn’t it a hero’s duty to rush over to wherever he’s called? ♪

What is it? I’ve got a bad feeling about this… You sometimes have a mischievous look on your face, Tenshouin.

There’s no need to be on your guard. I won’t harm you. I’d only tire myself if I got involved with you people, anyway…
That aside — give me your hand, Chiaki.

…? I don’t mind, but why? Are you going to read my palm?

I’m not so weak-willed as to rely on fortune-telling. Tsumugi’s always liked it though, so I have a little bit of knowledge on it.
I mean, look at mine — It says that I’ve got a long life ahead of me. Palm reading simply hasn’t got any credibility, has it?

Ahaha, I’m sure it means you really will live for a long time. …Alright, here’s my hand.

Mhm, here you go. It’s my White Day gift to you. ♪

Mm…? What is this, an envelope?

Yes, and some candy, too. You see, on Valentine’s Day—
Our Tori, all shy and nervous, squeezed a piece of chocolate into my hand.
There was always someone in the Student Council office that day to manage the Chocolat Fes—
But I think Tori was a little too embarrassed to give the chocolate to me in front of everyone.
That’s why he secretly made me hold it in my hand.
It turned out to be quite an amusing story in the end — The ever perceptive Yuzuru noticed his act and teased him for it, and the chocolate had melted in the heat of his palm.
Fufu. But it was so adorable that I couldn’t help but try to imitate it. ♪

Mm. I’ll be frank with you; when you do it, it feels really suggestive and disturbing. It’s just scary.

Is that so? Come now, Shinkai-kun, I’ll also give you a cookie. ♪

mm~ there is no [reason] for me to take it, is there?

Since you didn’t give me any chocolate, right?
Still, it’s fine, isn’t it? I may as well give you a gift since you’re here.
We can now live in this lovely modern age, all thanks to the precious sacrifice of you Five Eccentrics. This is my way of expressing gratitude for your achievements.

i would much rather pour those [feelings] down the drain.

How cruel. I see you don’t like me much. Oh well, I don’t blame you.

…i will also give you a [gift], mr. [emperor]. here is a fish [plush toy]. happy white day~♪

I certainly have no reason to receive a gift from you, though…?

fufu, thanks to mr. [emperor], i was able to have an enjoyable [high school] life~
so this is to express my [gratitude]. thank you very much~♪

Oh, is that so? Knowing you were able to enjoy yourself means that all my hard work has paid off. ♪

ufufu~…♪

Fufufu…♪

Woah, woah, woah! You two are scaring me! Don’t start fighting…!
For goodness’ sake… Get along with each other! Don’t you know that love saves the world?

It destroys it too, though. Regardless… The reason I called you here wasn’t just to give you a White Day gift, Chiaki.
I simply thought to give it to you while you’re here.
Allow me to get straight to the point: Do you, Ryuseitai, have any intention to participate in the Repayment Festival scheduled in two weeks?

I still haven’t received an application for participation from you, and from the looks of it, you haven’t made any preparations, either.
I grew a little concerned, hence why I called you over to confirm your status.

Ryuseitai has grown a remarkable amount over the past year, and has made its return as a powerhouse.
It will affect the number of visitors if you choose not to participate, so I’d like to at least know if you plan to or not.

Chapter 2
Repayment Festival… Ahh, it’s meant to be a White Day version of the Chocolat Fes we performed for Valentine’s Day, right?
I heard that it’s the first DreamFes to be centered around the underclassmen.

Hm. You don’t sound like you’ve looked into the details yet.
I figured that was the case, seeing that you had your very own farewell party yesterday.
Nevertheless, yes — the Repayment Festival is an event centered around the underclassmen.
Therefore, for us third-year students, it isn’t our job to manage it. We’re simply watching from the sidelines.
But that doesn’t mean we can be ignorant of it. The underclassmen are still unsteady on their feet.
For that reason, I thought you of all people would be taking care of your own juniors to an unbearable degree, Chiaki.

Mm… There are all sorts of things I’d love to help them out with, but… I’ve been pretty busy with my post-graduation job, and I didn’t think it would be a good idea to intrude on them.

I see… By the way, the envelope I just handed you has something to do with that future job of yours.
I know you wouldn’t have wanted it, but I’ve laid the groundwork for it nonetheless.

The entertainment industry is not an environment where you can survive through passion alone. I’m sure you’re well aware of that, though.
So, well, I made it a little easier for you to breathe.

Ah, I see… Thank you for that, then. It’s great to have friends by your side, huh — Tenshouin?

Friends, huh… The word still tastes a little too bitter for me.

Anyway… As for Ryuseitai, even before the Repayment Festival… You had already set up an environment, under your principles, that allowed the first-year students to have their thoughts be heard.
It was a unit where each member could assert what they wanted to do, without being restrained just because they were underclassmen.
Everyone shared their opinions and worked together hand-in-hand, correct?

That’s why I thought there wouldn’t be any real reason to worry just because you third-year students are leaving.
Whether it be project planning, deciding the contents of lessons and performances, and any other aspect of a unit…
You had always ensured to keep the first-year students’ opinions in mind, am I correct?
That’s exactly why Ryuseitai was slow at progress at the start, and became a late blooming flower.
After all, you would always respect the first-year students’ opinions above everything, despite their inexperience. You faced a lot of difficulties as a result of that.
Your unit was the type to mature its talents late. In other words, because of all their accumulated experience throughout the year, the first-year students should now have the appropriate skills to carry out their unit activities.
Therefore, they should also be able to handle the Repayment Festival without any problems.
That is what I had assumed — but perhaps I overestimated your unit.
There is no other group that excels at livening up the crowd like yours, so it would be discouraging not to have you participate.

Mmm… Alright, I understand.
I thought everything would go well if I were to leave it to them, including whether or not they should participate in the event, but…
They really haven’t done anything so far…? I see… I wonder what’s wrong — do you know anything, Kanata?
Those three should be fine without us now, shouldn’t they?

mm~… chiaki, you should be more [aware] of your [importance] in their lives.
to those children, it is [as if] the [sun] has gone down.

it is possible they cannot see anything in that darkness and have [lost] their way. gosh, they are such troublesome [children].
i am worried. shall we check how they are [doing] after this?

…No, we don’t need to interfere just yet. There’s still some time before the Repayment Festival.
Let’s wait and see. I’m also going out of my mind with worry, but…

From now on, they have to walk on their own feet. They can’t be spoiled by us forever.
I know a hero’s role is to fearlessly rush over when your allies are in a predicament, but… From here on out, it’s going to be a little harder to do that, as well.

We just have to trust those guys and watch over them. It would be a different story if they were to ask for our help, but for now, we should do our best to leave them to their own devices.
“If we call for help, they’ll surely come rushing for us”—
If they’ve come to convince themselves as such, to the point where they no longer try to fight on their own, then they aren’t qualified to be heroes.
So this will be their first test. I want them to overcome it by themselves as much as possible.

fufufu, you say all that even though you want to rush to their aid as soon as possible…
but [nature] is a harsh world, yes? you will simply [starve] to [death] if you cannot catch [food] on your own.

I agree with you there. It’s quite vexing, isn’t it? I feel like I’m watching a baby stand up for the first time.
Repayment Festival is such a cruel DreamFes…♪

Erm, is fine going to be alright…? Although, the showdown we had the other day gave me the impression that things are going okay on your side.[1]

Yes, I appreciate your help on that one. There are no real problems on our side, I suppose. Our strength will be more than halved when Wataru and I leave, but…
Tori is growing up beautifully and powerfully.
On the other hand, Yuzuru is fully prepared to assist Tori.
I’m certain that my beloved fine will continue to be the brilliant dazzling sun at the top of Yumenosaki Academy in the next school year.

Rather, the one I’m actually worried about is Akatsuki. Say, Shinkai-kun — Kanzaki-kun is in the same club as you, right?
Did you know that he’s missing?

ah, yes. i came here to [ask] about that, actually. i thought the [temple guy] would know where souma is.

Oh, yes, since Keito is part of Akatsuki. …I’ve been thinking about this for a while now, but you call him by a strange name, don’t you?

i have had a [connection] with that [temple] from long back, after all~…
[god] and [buddha] have always had a bad relationship since a looong time ago.

Ahh, so that’s why you’re so harsh with Keito…
Regardless, I don’t think he knows where Kanzaki-kun is either. He caused a huge fuss this morning because he couldn’t get in touch with him.

i see~… there is something to worry about no matter [where] you [go]…
are the [children] of yumenosaki academy really going to be okay…?

Chapter 1

    Location: At the Fountain


Huh~ So you’re gonna be some sorta multi-talented entertainer after graduation, Moricchi?

I’m not sure what to call it exactly, but I’m mainly going to be performing idol activities. Fortunately, there are a lot of people in the industry want to get in touch with me.
I’m going to be packed with work as soon as spring starts.

But I just can’t bring myself to abandon the dream I’ve had since I was young…
So I’d love to play the role of a hero in a tokusatsu show as well, and even appear in an educational program to inspire children.
Thanks to Tenshouin doing the best he can for me, I think I’ll have a good starting point.
Although, I’m not yet capable of expanding myself to accomplish so much, and on top of that, to succeed in every single thing I try.

It’ll be fine, won’t it? Hard work should be rewarded, right? If people like you can’t make their dreams come true—
If you can’t be happy, then people like me are screwed~♪

What’s that supposed to mean…? What are you going to do after graduation, Hakaze? Did you actually give it any thought?

Huh~? Sounds like you don’t have faith in me… I’m 100% gonna pursue an idol career. I already managed to convince my parents and brother about it.
My sister is fully supporting me, too.

Thing is though, my family is extremely practical~
They told me that if I don’t succeed even after putting in the effort, I should give up on being an idol once and for all.
And then, I should take over the Hakaze family business. I mean, I’m thankful that they have a backup plan prepared for me, but…
I didn’t really ask for their help… So maybe I feel this way ‘cause I’m in a rebellious phase of some sort…?
I was prepared to be disowned, but it just feels like I’m getting supervised instead…

Anyways, it’s kinda hard to do things on my own, so I’m hoping Sakuma-san could join me.
I asked him if he’s interested, so we’ll see what happens… It’s his life in the end. I can’t force him.

I see. Well, I’m sure you’ll be just fine. You’re so full of talent that I’m almost jealous.
I mean, if you won’t become an idol, who else will? Good luck out there! If you’re ever in trouble, you can always count on me.

Ahaha, you sure act big, huh~? Well, as fellow graduates, let’s continue to support each other~

Speaking of which… You reminded me when you mentioned Sakuma — What do you think Kanata is going to do after graduation…?

Huh? Wait, you don’t know either? I haven’t heard from him, so I was a little worried…
I really thought he would’ve told you something.

And I thought that he would have told you all about it… You didn’t hear anything either? Really…?
I wonder if he’s going to be alright… He could just disappear without a trace the moment we graduate.

I can totally see that happening~. …Even though we’d be more than happy to help if he just talked to us.

Honestly… The word “distant” was made for Kanata.[1]

…are you two [badmouthing] me~?

Whoa— You scared me! What’s the matter, Kanata? Why are you crouching down? Do you have a stomachache?

Ahh~… Since the inside of the fountain has been decorated for Repayment Festival, Kanata-kun can’t have his puka puka time, right?
That’s why he’s gazing at the water with an annoyed look on his face, with his hand touching the surface…♪

It’s still chilly out, so I don’t think you should be soaking in the water in the first place… Okay, Kanata? If you miss moisture, we can go to a nearby bathhouse together…♪

i do [not] like hot [water]~…
uuu~ how dare they do as they [like] to the [fountain] without my [permission]… this is unforgivable.

But the fountain belongs to the school. They don’t need your permission either way, do they?

…Hey, Kanata-kun~ Haven’t you told Moricchi about your household?

no, not really~ chiaki is chiaki in the end, so…
i do not think he would [treat] me any differently whether i explained it or not.

if that is the case, then i do not want to give him something so [heavy] to bear.
and if he already knows but is [pretending] not to, then i prefer to [respect] that [gentle lie].

Huh, I see… You cherish Moricchi a lot, don’t you? ♪

mm~… i am just protecting him, as he is still a [child]. he cannot do anything without me.

That’s what I should be saying. I was talking with Hakaze earlier about this but — what do you plan to do in the future?
It’s already March, so I’d like to believe you’ve decided on a career path by now…

But if you haven’t, then until the little guys from Ryuseitai catch up with us—
How about you and I temporarily team up as a duo? Like Kamen Rider No.1 and No.2![2] ♪

fufu. that is also a wonderful idea. i would have loved to do that…
it is all going to be okay, chiaki, kaoru. i also want to continue living on the [surface] with everyone, so…
i will make sure to get through somehow.
i will fight against my unreasonable [fate], and save my [world]. i am a hero too, after all.

You’re saying it all so vaguely… You just have to make it sound mysterious, huh?

fufufu. the [ends of the universe] and the [bottom of the ocean] are humankind’s last [frontiers], after all~…♪

You’re dodging the topic again… Call for me if you need help, Kanata. Whether it’s at the ends of the universe or at the bottom of the ocean, I’ll always come rushing to your side.

okaaay~ i will gladly call for you. i have not told you this before, but…
i have always been a [huge fan] of you, chiaki.
i will call for you even if i have no [reason] to, so… please come see me, okay? [promise] me, chiaki.

Chapter 2

    Location: Cafe


J-Ju…Justice.

Elk.

k-…ki~…kill…?

Kanata-kun, your word choices are messed up. All you’ve been saying is despair, madness, kill… What are you, a villain?

eh~… then [king crab].

B-B-… Umm…? Wake up, my brain cells!
I already said “bed,” and I can’t say a hero’s name or anything else like that because nobody knows them but me!
Oh! Bedstead! How about “bedstead”!?

Dachshund.

mm~…… “d” again…? d-d-de~…?

Yeah, uh, why do I get the feeling you’ll say “death”…? Can we stop playing word chain?[3] It’s really not that fun, and I just feel depressed now for some reason…

It’s mainly Kanata’s fault. What’s up, what’s wrong? You’ve been so gloomy the past few days! Cheer up! ☆

do not make a ruckus in the [cafe]…
i am a little concerned about what mr. [emperor] said. are the children really going to be alright?
we have not [heard] from souma, either… kaoru, did you learn anything?

Weeell… That kid seriously loathes me, soo~
I figured he can’t hate me any more than he already does. That’s why I tried calling him over and over again…
But he just yelled at me for being annoying, and blocked my number.

fufu, kaoru, you knew souma’s [phone number]~?

Yup, I excel at getting that kinda information out of people. …Anyway, that at least means that Souma-kun is alive and well, right?
Honestly, I’m more excited than worried.
I mean, he hasn’t explained what’s going to both you and Hasumi-kun — It really feels like the serious, good boy’s going through his very first rebellious phase~♪
I’m kinda concerned about my juniors in UNDEAD, though…
I feel like Sakuma-san’s bad side is coming out… Y’know, how he can be waaay too careful, and just ends up hitting a nerve instead.

ahh… rei can be like that sometimes.

Hm… Well, either way, we have no choice but to sit tight and see what happens. Repayment Festival is the debut stage for the underclassmen, and they shouldn’t perform it under training wheels.
While I am worried about the kids, we can’t interfere. We’ll just have to pass the time by chatting in a cafe, or something of the like.
It’s a frustrating but necessary process.

It’s time for the parents to let go, and for the children to be independent. It’s sad and distressing, but I believe it’s our responsibility to stay put.
Well, to tell you the truth, though… I feel like I’m about to explode, trying to hold back the urge to take care of my juniors.

chiaki, stop [tapping] your foot. don’t you know that’s shameful~?

You’re such a mom, Kanata-kun.
…Ah, sorry. Sakuma-san wants me to go see him for some reason, so I’m gonna head back to school.

okay~ what does rei [want]?

No clue. He sent me a message, but…
He sucks at using the phone keyboard[4], so his messages practically end up needing to be decoded, like this one — he said, “i went t talk bout dedmens”.
“Dedmens”… Ahh, I think he means “Deadmanz”. I haven’t heard that name in a while. Why’s he bringing it up now, after so long…?

Oh well, the only way to find out is to ask him. See you two later then! Thanks for spending time with me, bye bye~♪

Mhm! Farewell, Hakaze! Until we meet again…☆
Heheh… Hakaze seems a little different. He looks like he’s shining these days.

kaoru has always been [sparkling].
…oh?

Taichou-dono! Shinkai-dono…!

Sengoku? Why do you look so pale…? Did something happen!?

actually, shinobu… how did you know we were in this [cafe]?
is it because you are a [ninja]? it is, isn’t it? fufufu…♪

No, I just happened to see you two through the windo—… Ah, no, I mean — Yes, of course it is because I’m a ninja!

Heh! Ninjas are professionals in espionage! ♪

Sengoku, tell us why you’re here. You don’t seem like your usual self.
Don’t I tell you this all the time? Calm down. Don’t worry, it’s all going to be okay.

U-Uuu~! Taichou-dono, Shinkai-dono! I beg of you, from the bottom of my heart…!

Whoa—!? Stop, Sengoku! Don’t kneel on the ground in a public area!

um, shinobu… are you alright? are you crying…?
please don’t cry… everything will be okay, you are a good boy~?


Uuu~… I am not a good boy at all… What I did with the best of my intentions has triggered a catastrophe!
T-Tetora-kun and Midori-kun are fighting! No matter what Anzu-dono or I say, they won’t listen…!
I can’t do anything on my own! I’m too weak! I don’t have the capability to stop them from fighting! So, please, please…! I need your help! This is the only favor I’ll ever ask from you…!







Translation Notes
↑ In Japanese, the word for “distant” is mizu-kusai, lit. “watery”.↑ This is a reference to the first Kamen Rider series, where the first rider was called Kamen Rider ichi-go (No.1), and the second Kamen Rider ni-go (No.2).↑ In Japanese, they're playing shiritori. It goes: Chiaki → seigi (justice), Kaoru → gingamu chekku (gingham check), Kanata →  kutsuu (pain), kurione (clione), Chiaki →  neko (cat), neko jarashi (cat teaser), Kaoru → shishi-odoshi, Kanata → shi (which can mean “death”). Since Kaoru's word choices were uncommon, Chiaki's were basic, and Kanata's were negative, I tried to make it similar in the English version.↑ Originally, Kaoru says that Rei's bad at kanji conversion (tapping on the kanji/katakana you want to use when typing on the keyboard), which leads to Rei converting all the characters incorrectly in the message, like so: でど万ズの子とで話がアル (it should be デッドマンズのことで話がある）]]></content>

Chapter 1

    Location: At the fountain (White Day)


Anzu-chan, the moon is pretty tonight, isn’t it?
Fufu, looks like it’ll be a while until the sun is up.
Tori and Yuzuru worked really hard and got through the first half with a good score, so… fine’s turn in the festival will be quite a bit later.
I wonder what kind of repayment those kids will give Wataru and me, and to the other seniors who’ll be leaving? I&#39;m thrilled to find out.
Fufu, of course you, as the producer, know exactly what fine will be doing in the second half, but…
“Don’t tell me! I’ll imagine it myself!”
That was my attempt at imitating Tsukinaga-kun. I’d prefer it if you didn’t take away the blissful moments of gazing at a present and imagining what could be inside of it.

…Anzu-chan?
Oh my, I was wondering why you weren’t responding. You’ve fallen asleep.
It did seem like a lot of hard work for you once again… You ran around doing all sorts of things for multiple units.
But that’s exactly why you should wake up after we’ve reached the auditorium for the second half of the festival.

Your beloved idols are all waiting to give you the gifts reserved just for you.
If you sleep through that and miss it, they might be disappointed.
Fufu, but at the very least, you should relax and rest up until that joyful moment begins.
I’ll carefully carry you bridal style, so that you don’t shake about as we get there. This is my White Day gift to you.
Ahh… For once in a long time, I feel like I can sleep soundly tonight without any worries.
One day, when I sleep forever — when I die — I want it to be with this kind of feeling.

………

Hm? Hello there, Subaru-kun. What a coincidence that we meet here.

Ah! Heya, Eichi-senpai! Good evening~☆

Shhh… You really don&#39;t pay attention to your surroundings, do you? Anzu-chan is sleeping, so could you stay quiet?

Woah—! Sorry. Wait, why&#39;re you carrying Anzu? Were you two on good terms?

Yes. Well, I want to think that we were at least able to become friends.
Fufu, you know… It seems like Keito is unusually going all-out this time around.
So the Student Council duties were delayed a bit, and Anzu-chan and I tried to finish up the rest of it at the Student Council office.
I caused Keito a lot of trouble, so I wanted to pay him back, even if a little.
In any case, we finished most of the work, and it was about time for the second half of the festival to start. That’s why the two of us were happily heading to the auditorium.
But on the way there, she started crouching down… I was worried for a second, but it looked like she just fell asleep.

Hmm, I see. Wanna switch places, Eichi-senpai? You don’t have much strength, right? Isn&#39;t it rough for you to carry someone all on your own?

No, it’s fine. You must be busy too, what with helping UNDEAD and all…
So just leave this to your bored senior~♪

Alright. I’ll leave it to you, but bring her back later, okay?

I will. I almost want to keep her for myself, but love is something to be shared.
Fufu, we’ll obviously get cold if we keep standing around and talking in a place like this. Let&#39;s each head off to where we should be before we catch a cold.

Okay then, see ya~♪

……Actually, Eichi-senpai.

Hm? What is it, Subaru-kun?

Did you have fun in the three years you were here?

Of course. All the days I spent here were shining and glittering more than a jewel ever could.
I&#39;m sure the rest of you students will also get to enjoy a bright, youthful life, just as I did — perhaps even more than I ever did.
Ahh, that makes me jealous.
…Oh, that’s right. Yumenosaki Academy’s Top Idol is my title, but…
Is it alright if I entrust that title to you? Until Tori has fully grown up?

Hm? I don’t really want something like that, though.
But I like to take what I’m given~♪

I see… Ahh, that’s a relief.
Unlike Valentine&#39;s Day, the gift you give on White Day is likely to make the person happy in the end anyway, but it doesn&#39;t change the fact that it makes you nervous.
Fufu, well then, see you later. It’s a shame, but it’s time to part.
Once you’re done with what you have to do, come over to the auditorium. It seems that Ryuseitai has something interesting planned.
So you should come to watch and enjoy your senior and junior of the same club in their iconic moment.

Mhm, I totally intend to watch over that.
Heheh, Chi~chan-senpai’s number one favorite may be Takamin and all, but…
It still does frustrate me a little that Takamin gets to have everything for himself.
Not to mention, it looks like he’s gonna become the exact kinda hero Chi~chan-senpai hoped for—
So… maybe I should become the exact kinda idol Chi~chan-senpai hoped for.
That’ll be our repayment to him, and today will mark the memory of that first step.
I’m pretty hyped, Eichi-senpai.

Me too, Subaru-kun. Ahh, doesn’t it make you so glad to be born?

Chapter 2

    Location: Repayment Festival Stage (Ryuseitai)


Kanata-kuuun! Moricchi~!
Over here, over here! C&#39;mon, Ryusetai’s up next, y&#39;know~♪

kaoru. …your eyes seem [red]. were you crying?

Huh!? Why&#39;re you so sharp sometimes!? You’re usually a thickheaded alien, y&#39;know!?
I confessed to Anzu-chan knowing I’d be rejected, and lo and behold, I was~! So let me off, alright!?

ahaha, poor you.
…but, well, our [fight] has probably only just begun.

Yeah, Sakuma-san also told me something like that~ Just what I’d expect from an Eccentric — You guys have similar ways of comforting people~♪

fufu. kaoru, you will work with rei as an [idol] from here on out, right? i will cheer you on.

Thanks. You too, Kanata-kun. If things with your family ever get rough, run away to my place.
You’re always welcome, okay? I’d be good at taking care of someone if it’s only you.

fufu, for you of all people to be pushing yourself… but thank you.

You don’t have to thank me. You’re my friend, y’know?

yes. …did everything go okay with souma? i am sorry for leaving you to [deal] with everything.

Yeah. There was one point when it was a bit worrying, but I think everything&#39;s okay for now.
It seems like he got through the first part of the live safely, and now he and the other two from Akatsuki are going to peacefully have fun with the second part.

Heheh, Souma-kun is a real goody boy, after all. If he can’t be happy, nobody can.
…Woops, looks like I’m off. My good pals are still overexcited, they’ve been prancing around even after our live’s been over.
Honestly, they’re such a handful~♪

fufu, good job, kaoru. good boy, gooood boy~…♪

Ahaha, the only people who called me a good boy from beginning to end were… my mom and you, Kanata-kun.
Thank you. To be honest, it made me pretty happy.
Right then, bye bye. See you another time, Kanata-kun.

yes, we will meet again somewhere, kaoru.

…chiaki. you were very [quiet] for once; are you tired?


Ah no, I just thought it’d be rude to interrupt. Even I read the room sometimes, Kanata.

whaaat~ that is [news] to me.
more importantly… shall we at least [greet] the [children] together?

Alright, then let’s go to the dressing room backstage. Hopefully they aren’t fighting again.

i am sure they are [alright]. it seems like they were able to safely [get through] the [first half] of the live.
i am sure they are [having fun] performing after making up~♪

I hope so… Oh, we don’t even need to go backstage; they’ve already shown themselves!
Heeey, my comrades! We’re a little late, but we’re here to cheer you on! ☆

…Ryusei Punch!

Ryusei Kiiick~♪

Ryusei Shuriken~☆

Gwah!? W-Why did you suddenly charge at me, my comrades!? Were you brainwashed by the enemy!?


What “enemy”… You’re both late! We were worried you wouldn’t even come, y&#39;know!? Just what took you so long!?

Huh? Huh!? Sorry! The people in the shopping district took a liking to us somehow, and we ended up singing on an outdoor stage!

The two of us sang a duet together after so long~♪
Fuhaha! Worry not, Takamine! The greengrocer store is also thriving! ☆

Ughh, there you go again with doing needless—… You’re always like this…
I guess I can’t really complain though, not when you did it in my place…
Were you able to get things done without any problems…? It does sound like it was a great success, though…

Yep! Basically the festival guy, a former Ryuseitai member, helped us out! In the end, we gave all the work to him and rushed right over!

Festival guy… Ahh, that weirdo…

yes, that [rogue].

Yeah, he caused me a lot of trouble when he just went and left Ryuseitai.
So at the very least, before school ends, he’s helping us out right now as a former brother-in-arms who wore the same uniform.
That aside! There are no problems over on that side, so you can enjoy yourselves in the live show without any worry!
We’ll be watching you from the audience! Watching over your very lives that inherited the heart of justice…!
Ahh, just seeing your majestic selves makes me feel like I&#39;m about to burst into tears!
Hang in there, Ryuseitai, do your best! Don’t lose now, Ryuseitai, do your best!!

Chapter 3
♪~♪~♪

♪~♪~♪

♪~♪~♪
(Heheheh. For a while there, I was unsure how this would go, but we may actually be able to get through Repayment Festival to the very end.)
(What a relief~ But it is still not the time to be slacking around.)
(In fact, it is going to get rougher from here on out… For the coming days after our seniors graduate…)
(Just thinking about it now makes my stomach hurt…)

(And to be honest, Tetora-kun and Midori-kun have not completely made up, either.)
(Midori-kun arrived pretty late, so we decided to leave the talking for later and just do our best for now…)
(We quickly rehearsed together and rushed everything up until this point.)
(With how much of a mess it has been, it is truly a miracle we managed to get past the first part…)
(Of course, that is only how we feel about it mentally. Our actual performance has been going fine.)
(We have grown. No, actually, with everyone’s strength combined, we managed to overcome many hardships…)
(Those hardships united us as allies with a bond stronger than friends or family, and has helped us hone ourselves.)

(With every dance step, every song, we grew closer, stronger… Whenever I remember all of that, I start to really feel like we have changed.)
(So maybe… we&#39;ll be okay. I&#39;m sure of it.)

(At the very least, that’s what I&#39;m going to keep believing in.)[1]
(This isn&#39;t our last time or anything.)

(…Ahaha, it’s not every day that I see Shinobu-kun with a serious look on his face.)
(That’s how much we’re on his mind, I bet. He’s so concerned ‘bout us that he can’t even mess around.)
(Shinobu-kun’s looks are surprisingly dignified. He’s manly, even.)

(If he wore stylish clothes and pulled his hair up like how his beloved Isara-senpai does… He would pull it off perfectly and thrive just fine the traditional idol way.)
(And yet, despite that, he continued to stay by our side. Even if he was all alone, he would continue to enjoy what he loves to the very end…)
(And continue enjoying life as himself, as a master of his own castle.)
(Isn’t that so cool? I admire that ‘bout him so much.)

(I dunno if someone hollow like me… is even qualified to lead guys as cool as Shinobu-kun and Midori-kun…)
(But I’ve been asked to take up the commander role. For the first time in my life, I’ve been tasked with something that is seen as, “something that can only be entrusted to you, Nagumo.”)
(So I’m going to take risks and devote my whole self to this.)

(I’m clumsy, so I can’t do things right at all.)
(It won&#39;t go according to how I hope, like it did for Taichou or Taishou, or even a hero from a tokusatsu… not even like a protagonist from a story.)
(But… No matter how much I fail, no matter how muddy I get, no matter how pathetically hard I cry… I won’t run away anymore. I’ll stand firm.)
(A loss isn’t a loss if you refuse to accept defeat to the very end.)
(Even if no one cares  me anymore, even if I become hated, and the people around me leave…)
(At the very least I, as part of Ryuseitai, will stand my ground with the legacy of my seniors.)

(Even if the only thing I can do is to stand tall. Just like what Taishou told me ‘bout how Taichou was in the past… I’ll keep fighting without giving up.)
(Even if people laugh at me and say I’m incompetent, I’m sure at least Midori-kun and Shinobu-kun&#39;d accept me for who I am. They’ll come rushing to me, picking me back up when I’m ‘bout to fall.)
(No, I’m sure they’d even fight alongside me. I can believe in that, right?)

(And in reality, Shinobu-kun has always been by my side. Midori-kun came back too, even if it took him a while.)
(The bonds we’ve sewn and strengthened together with everyone throughout this whole year… They’re not fragile at all, but tough and invincible.)

(This isn’t dependence, it’s trust. I’ll take this to heart, and keep saying how I feel from now on!)
(I won’t hold back anymore, I won’t go easy on anyone, I won’t fear the idea of being hated.)
(&#39;Course, it’s still scary, but I shouldn’t run away &#39;cuz of that. That’s not what it means to be a hero…)
(Yeah, that’s right, I wanna be a hero too.)
(I wanna be a cool man among men. Even if it’s difficult for me right now, one day, surely…)


…Tetora-kun.

Hm? What’s up, Midori-kun…?
We’re in the middle of our performance, y&#39;know? Talking isn’t allowed.

Ahaha, you&#39;re sounding like a leader…♪

Do you have a complaint ‘bout that? Ah, could it be that you wanted to be the next “Ryusei Red” or something?
You’ve always been real close with Taichou, after all… It wouldn’t be strange if you’ve been thinking of inheriting that color all along.

But it’s not allowed. I’ve been aimin&#39; for the red color for a long time.
I’m not giving it away, not even to you.

If you&#39;ve got any complaints, then we&#39;ll take it to a match and decide things with our fists, mano a mano!

You’re so wild… I’m fine being Green, in fact it’s a color I fairly like…
And besides, I don’t really wanna fight…
I mean, I’ve always been this way… I’ve never really had a fight with someone before &#39;cause I’d always run away before it could&#39;ve happened…
So I’m not really used to this, I feel conflicted inside, and a lot feels wrong…
But just this once, I thought to myself that this isn’t something to run away from and let slide…

Chapter 4
Actually, even if I did try to run away — Morisawa-senpai, Shinkai-senpai, or Anzu-san…
Someone will interfere and grab me by the neck to say, “come over here already!”, and pull me back to the problems I should face head-on…
But… Just relying on others to do that for me is so childish, and I hate it…
I may be a good-for-nothing guy who’s only physically grown up, but I’m not a baby or an infant…
My actual mental growth was slow, unlike my body&#39;s… Once again, I’m a dunce who took forever to come rushing back to all of you…
But I love you all, I wanna be together with you all… Someone like me may just be a huge eyesore, but I wanna stay by everyone’s side…
I told you that you’re neither my family nor my siblings, but I wanna amend that…
People who’d get that angry just for my sake — even if they aren’t my family — are people I should treasure just like family, if not more…

If I had left things like that and ran away, I would have never been able to show my face to anyone ever again…
It&#39;d be unforgivable just to keep breathing… And then I really would get depressed and die…
So please, let me be by your sides. Even if this is only a dream, I don’t wanna wake up from it yet.

Ahaha, it’s too late to be modest now after everything, Midori-kun.
Have we ever once said “Don’t come with us” or “Go away” to you?

Huuuh? You did! You told me I should’ve just disappeared!

Wha—!? Sorry, I wasn’t thinking straight back then and ended up saying somethin&#39; I didn’t mean!

Didn’t mean it, huh!? It hurt me so much, I could’ve died…!!

H-Heeey, you two!? No fighting! We’re still in the middle of our live, you know~!


hehe, that’s right~ if you were to [chatter] during [combat]… you would immediately die~♪

Yep! It’s just as Kanata said! This is extremely important, so carve it into your hearts! How long are you planning to let the filler arc run!? It’s time for you to get back on track with the live!

What the…!? Huh? Taichou? Shinkai-senpai?
W-Why&#39;re you two on stage? And you’re even wearing clothes that match our outfits for Repayment Festival…!

Is there any problems with that? We’re also Ryuseitai, at least for now!
Heheh. Takamine said something particularly interesting, so when I asked Anzu about it…
Oh, to be clear, it was while I was giving her something for White Day!
Anyway, so it seemed like she had already prepared outfits for us, too… It was her who sewed Ryuseitai&#39;s outfits this time.
Because she thought to herself, “It&#39;ll probably be the five of them on stage like always.”
So she said, “I ended up making outfits for all five of you~” with her tongue stuck out like she was giggling! It was cute~☆
That face she made was definitely on purpose! Is she one of those cute villain ladies who appear in tokusatsu or what!?
In any case, there are outfits for us too, so it’d be a waste not to wear them, wouldn’t it?
And besides, this may be the last chance for the five of us to be on stage together.
It&#39;ll be the last memory we make together. But if we’re in your way, then we&#39;ll step back.
But I really just can’t sit back and watch anymore!

Ahhh, it was really rough for me this time around! I wanted to say something, to do something!
I wanted to spend all my energy being busy! To fix all your problems, like I always did!

I love you guys so much! But it’s because I love you that I shouldn’t be carrying you around and spoiling you forever!

that’s right, chiaki~
if you get too involved with the aquarium’s [fish], then they, like the [children], will die by the [stress]. we should only be watching from afar.

fufufu, it was also rough on me to only be [watching], though.
i am [relieved]. you three will be [alright] even if we are not here… you will be able to weather any [storm].
it is sad to say [goodbye], but i now look [forward] to our [next meeting] after you have grown to be even more [splendid].
puka, puka…♪

Ahaha… These two never miss a chance to take the spotlight, huh…?

W-What should we do? Tetora-kun…?

Well, it’s fine, isn’t it? We’re wrapping things up anyway.
And our audience would want it to be the five of us together as Ryuseitai.
At least once, I want them to witness a miracle: the five of us together here, in our gallant glory.
We&#39;ll have to get used to Ryuseitai being just the three of us, but that&#39;s not until later, right?

Us three won’t be able to fill the leading roles by ourselves just yet, so I’ll gratefully let our seniors interfere this time around.
Besides, it’s a blessing to know we’re not fightin&#39; alone.
But y&#39;know, you two were meant to be our audience…
You haven’t done any practice, right? You sure you can sing and dance alright?

Fuhaha!! Don’t look down on us, Nagumo! We’re veterans holding three years of experience and hard work in the mud!
It&#39;s been a while since our last transformation, but with it, we&#39;ll be able to fight on the same level as you guys!

that’s right~ there is no need to talk about trivial things. instead, focus on what you [must] do.
let&#39;s make our [guests] excited as we always do… together~♪
now then, let&#39;s begin from what we all [know]… what we always [promise] to do~♪

Chapter 5
hello! we are ryuseitai! thank you for coming over to see our [live]…♪
all of you probably know [who] we are, but it is a [standard] for us to do this, so~ first, we will begin with our [introductions].
the blue flame is the mark of mystery! i have come from the blue sea~♪
ryusei blue! shinkai kanata…☆ (sparkle)

Ahaha, it is unusual for you to be the one to take the initiative, Shinkai-dono.
If we are talking about speed, that would be my area of expertise as a ninja, you know~ But oh well, I will leave it to you so you can look cool~♪

fufu, i am sorry for taking your [forte], shinobu~♪

No problem at all~! To be a ninja is to take three steps back and stay behind others as their shadow.
But even so, I don&#39;t want to be forgotten.


Actually… So that I am not forgotten, so that people will not say they don&#39;t even know whether I&#39;m here or not… I, too, will loudly and magnificently introduce myself.
The yellow flame is the mark of hope! A single miracle shining into the darkness!
Ryusei Yellow! Sengoku Shinobu…☆
C’mon, c’mon! You do it too, Tetora-kun, Midori-kun! ♪

Uu~myu… I had a plan for how we were gonna do this, though… Now that everyone’s just doin&#39; as they please, it’ll be tough to get everything back on track.
But that is the usual for us anyway.

I dunno if I can do things as properly as Taichou did… but I’m gonna burn the flames of justice I inherited to their limit and do my absolute best.


As a member of Ryuseitai — No… As the next commander to lead Ryuseitai—
I’m gonna shine bright like the sun. Today, tomorrow, and forever onward. I’ll burn a bright red.
But just for today, I’ll respect that our seniors are here, and introduce myself like this:
The black flame is the mark of effort! The burning fighting spirit, stained with the soil of the earth!
Ryusei Black! Nagumo Tetora…☆

Fuhahaha! ☆ In my eyes, you’re already dazzling bright like the burning red sun!
Protect Ryuseitai and this world’s peace… Future Taichou!
If anyone can do it, it’s you.
Black absorbs all light, and you can now take all of that stored up energy and let it explode as you please.
I&#39;m sure you will be able to use that strength properly.
(…Woops. I shouldn’t be fascinated by the sight right now; I have to introduce myself, too.)
(I’m no longer a kid whose eyes glisten as he watches heroes being heroes—)
(—Because I was able to become the hero I&#39;ve always longed to be.)
(Heh~♪ Time to introduce myself with the loudest voice and the best smile in history!)

The red flame is——Gwah!?

………

Huh? Um, Takamine? Why did you kick my butt?
Did I do something wrong!? Are you angry!?

Hmph… Well, I do dislike the way you&#39;re walking on eggshells around me… You don’t have to worry so much, jeez… You’re way too late for that, anyway…

Morisawa-senpai. I’ll at least be honest with you now. I owe you a lot for this whole year.
You may have always been annoying, suffocating, clingy, gross, loud, unpleasant, troublesome, and really gross, but—

You said it twice! You said “gross”‬ twice!!

But. I think I was also an unpleasant junior who was always lazy and kept snapping back…
So, well… Let’s just call it even.
All the kindness you’ve given me — Even if I spent my whole life trying, I don’t think I could ever fully return the favor. But at the very least, I&#39;ll prove to you that your year didn&#39;t go to waste.
Thanks to you, even I’ve changed a little… and I&#39;ll show that to you now.
When we first met, you asked me, “Won&#39;t you become a hero?”
And I never gave you an answer… But now I&#39;ll answer you not with words, but with actions.
Even if I did say it with words, you wouldn’t listen anyway…… So please watch my transformation closely.

Ah! That&#39;s Kuuga! That&#39;s Kamen Rider Kuuga&#39;s line!


Shut it.
The green flame is the mark of compassion—
The great nature that grows infinitely! Ryusei Green, Takamine Midori…!

(Takamine.)
(Ahaha, you finally properly introduced yourself… Even though you always said it was too embarrassing and you didn’t get it… You whined that you didn&#39;t want to do it, only doing it as you pleased…)
(So that&#39;s your answer, Takamine. Ahh, I&#39;m glad. I&#39;m so relieved.)

(Ahaha… No good, I really didn&#39;t want to cry until after graduation, not in front of the kids at least… But my vision is getting blurry already.)

Hey, come on now… This isn&#39;t the time to be crying, please finish what you have to do. We&#39;d like to hear your usual catchphrase.
Please shine in your own way, as you always have — within the center of everyone.

I never really disliked seeing that… Morisawa-senpai.

I see, so that’s how it was all along… That’s good, I’m glad. Ahh, I’m just so glad.
I truly feel rewarded. To be a hero means to not ask for anything in return… but if I’ve been loved and thanked, and brought a smile to someone who was crying—
Then there was value and reason to the desperate fight it took to reach here after all.


Thank you.
The red flame is the mark of justice! Burning bright red, the sun of life!
Ryusei Red! Morisawa Chiaki!
With the five of us together! We are Ryuseitai…!

Chapter 1

    Location: At the fountain (White Day)


Tetora-kuuun! At last, it is the day of the Repayment Festival! ♪
Ahh, it was really tough up until this point!

While it is a good thing that we, Ryuseitai, have decided to participate… In the end, Midori-kun did not show up to practice.
Neither did Taichou-dono nor Shinkai-dono… They insist that Repayment Festival is mainly conducted by juniors, so they will be watching from the audience seats only.
We decided to participate really late in… Because of that, I feel like we have not been able to get enough practice.
The future ahead of us is shrouded in mysterious darkness~… Ninjas are destined to thrive in darkness, though.

But it seems we will only be singing our most well-known songs rather than doing something new, so…
As long as we do our best and focus, I believe that we will get through it.
Normally, it would be all five of us performing the songs together, so… having to do all this work on our own will be tough.
I feel like if it could have been the three of us — If Midori-kun were here — We could manage to make it look good enough…
But there is no point in wishing for what you cannot have, so we will get through Repayment Festival with the two of us.
Let&#39;s prove to everyone that Ryuseitai, Yumenosaki’s oldest powerhouse unit, is still going strong! Hip hip hooray! ♪

………

T-Tetora-kun? Please respond~ I am going against my character for the sole purpose of pumping us up!
I-If even you become clouded with darkness, it will seriously be a doomed ending~! Isn&#39;t our bright and fun liveliness what makes us Ryuseitai?

…Ah, my bad. I was meditating.
I make it a rule to sit cross-legged and meditate before every live.
Nothing’ll come outta complainin’ at this point, sooo I’m gonna brace myself and get through this with everything I’ve got.

I’m sorry, Shinobu-kun. All I’ve done is make you worry.
If I was all alone in this, I probably would’ve broken down.
But you kept saying silly things to ease the mood, even if it was forced… You really helped me out.
Actually, no — you’ve always helped me out.
Ninjas are meant to be the dark type, but whenever you’re around, the mood gets a lot brighter. You really are a single miracle shining into the darkness~♪

Heheh, there is no need to thank me, Tetora-kun.
All for one, and one for all. That is what Ryuseitai is all about.

But you know, it feels like, while everyone has been emotionally unstable — Or rather, while everyone&#39;s getting emotional and sentimental about the coming graduation—
I’m the only one who is acting like everything is normal. I feel like I’m being heartless.

No way~ I admire that &#39;bout you. You’re always looking on the bright side of things.
I’m constantly pessimistic and worried over everything, so I’m envious of that.

Ahaha. In sentai squads, Yellow is typically the one to liven the mood.
But Black is the opposite and like, seems to always be putting up with heavy burdens — that sort of thing.

I’m not tryin’ to act the part, though. I really am feeling depressed…
I said horrible things to Midori-kun. I acted unfairly, like I knew better than him.
If we join Repayment Festival without Midori-kun, it’ll be really hard to go back to the way things were.
I know that, yet I still decided that we’d join in ‘cuz I wanna repay our seniors.
I’m so selfish, I always make it &#39;bout myself. I’m really not fit to be a leader.

Ahaha, it&#39;s not like you can do things perfectly from the very beginning.
It took me many years before I was finally able to properly hit bullseye with my shuriken.
It requires constant training. And if anyone ever laughs at you or says it was a waste of effort—
Then your comrades from Ryuseitai — or at the very least I would praise you in awe and say, “That was totally awesome!”
So hold your head high with pride and do your best with everything you have, and you will get through every hardship that comes your way.
I may not be that reliable, but I will always be your ally… Future Taichou-dono.

…Thanks, Shinobu-kun.

Heeey, you two! Can we talk for a sec?

Eeek!?
That surprised me—! W-wh-wh-what is it… Erm, Hakaze-dono?

Ahaha, I’m not of a high enough status to be called by -dono.
The same can be said about Souma-kun, but why&#39;re you mixing up time periods like that? Man, this school really is filled with weirdos~♪
But it’s good that way. It’d be boring if everyone was the same.
Anyway, you two are from Ryuseitai, right? Do you know where Kanata-kun might be?
There’s something I want him to help me with a little, sooo~♪

Mm…? Um, I think Shinkai-dono and Taichou-dono are only going to be our audience for Repayment Festival…
And it seems they are scheming something in particular, so they are not here.
I know that much from keeping in contact with them… Wait, no— I know this because ninjas are messengers.

Hmm… Ahh, alright, I see. Kanata-kun’s busy on his side too, huh.
Oh well, nothing I can do about that… Looks like it’s up to me to deal with Souma-kun.

…? Did something happen to Kanzaki-dono?
If he is in any trouble, I will do whatever I can to help.

Ooh, you boys from Ryuseitai really are good kids.
Mhm, Moricchi must’ve done a good job raising you. If only I’d gotten close to him sooner, then I could’ve learned the secrets of that kinda stuff.
But it&#39;s too late to say that now, so I&#39;ve just gotta work as hard as I can with what I have.

Chapter 2
…? What are you talking about, Hakaze-dono?

Ahaha, it’s nothing to do with you guys.
Sorry for interrupting you guys right before the live show~ Repayment Festival is centered on you juniors, so you’re probably unsure of yourselves, but… just do what you can~♪
I’m cheering you goody boys on. …Well, time to go, bye byeee~♪

Ossu, good work out there…?
…What was that ‘bout, anyway?

No idea… I’m not sure what’s going on, but it seems like things are hectic and all over the place…
It’s always like that when Anzu-dono plans a DreamFes, though.

But that’s what makes it worth it to be a part of ‘em. I do feel like we go through a lot when it&#39;s a DreamFes by Anego, but once it’s all over with, the memory is usually a happy one.
I’m hoping it&#39;ll be the same this time, too, so… Let’s do our very best, Shinobu-kun.

Of course! Even if it’s just the two of us, we are still Ryuseitai! Let’s do our best to ensure our guests have fun~! ♪

Yep. No matter the outcome, as long as we put all our effort into this, we won’t have any regrets. No matter how roughed up and muddy we get, we’ll make sure to repay our seniors.
We’ll start by working on the first half of the festival.
Similar to Chocolat Fes and the S1 event that Anego planned back in the latter part of the year, the festival is split into two halves.
For the first half, we perform on one of the stages in the academy.
Then, any unit that earns a lotta votes get to participate in the second half of the festival.
Ryuseitai has a lotta loyal fans, and we got a pretty good score in the preliminary Chocolat Fes, so…
We should be able to perform our live in the grand auditorium.
I feel a li’l bad relying on the legacy left by our seniors, but all the same… as long as we don’t make some huge mistake, we’ll probably be able to proceed to the second half.

Heheh, other units are probably doing all they can to repay their seniors, too… So if we’re careless with our performance, we will get knocked right out of the competition.
Although overthinking it will not necessarily lead to a good outcome, either…
Let’s relax and work on getting our performance down as precisely as possible before the real thing begins.

Ossu, gotcha. Let’s practice as much as time will let us, Shinobu-kun.

…Erm, and just in case… It might end up goin&#39; to waste, but… Can we practice doing our performance as if it’s all three of us?
Just in case… Midori-kun comes rushing back to us.
I haven’t talked to him since we fought, so I know it&#39;s not good to get my hopes up too much.
I&#39;m sure it’d be better if we just made it into a two-man performance and practiced it that way, but…

…I’m such a wuss, aren’t I? But I don’t wanna think that Midori-kun would look away and ignore his own friends when they’re in trouble.
He’s surprisingly sharp-tongued, and there are times when I do think it’s frustrating how uncooperative he can be, but…
When it comes down to it, he&#39;s a good guy — or, well, a really cool guy, y’know?
So I wanna believe in him and wait for him ‘til the very end… ‘Cuz he’s our comrade — our friend.

I feel the same way, Tetora-kun.
Heh~ So it’s our duty to fight with everything we have until our comrade comes back, correct?
I am sure that, as long as we don’t give up, we will be able to miraculously turn things around to our side.
That is exactly what tokusatsu shows always promise to deliver.


    Location: Shopping Distract


………
(Ahh… I hear music coming from Yumenosaki’s direction…)
(Repayment Festival has already started by now, huh…)

(Anzu-san told me that those two decided to join the festival without me in the end…)
(And it sounds like our seniors will stay in their seats for the entirety of it… I wonder if Tetora-kun and Sengoku-kun will be okay…)
(She told me that it seems like they&#39;re going through a lot, so I should go work hard with them, too…)

(But even if you ask me to do that… It has nothing to do with me… They’re probably sick of me by now, anyway…)
(From the very start, all I’ve ever done is hold everyone back… Whether I’m there or not changes nothing…)

(I guess if I&#39;m there as part of the audience, I could at least help Ryuseitai get an extra vote, but… that really won&#39;t make a difference either way…)
(And I have work to do in the greengrocer shop, anyway…)
(From now on, that’s the only thing I’ll be able to do — Just supporting them as a fan…)
(…………)

(Ahh, I&#39;m doing it again… I&#39;m running away from something I can&#39;t stand, and making up whatever excuses I can think of… Why am I always like this…)
(Even though it&#39;s White Day today… the day to return all the love you were given…)
(I practically owe them my whole life — Tetora-kun, Sengoku-kun, and all of Ryuseitai — and yet I&#39;m just…)
(…Even if I go to them now, I wouldn&#39;t be of much help, but… I don&#39;t want it to end like this, either…)
(At the very least, I&#39;ll make sure to support them whenever I have time off from work…)

(I don&#39;t care that it won&#39;t make any difference… I love everyone, so I…)
(I&#39;ll do it, only ‘cause I’ve always felt so bad for constantly causing trouble to my precious allies…)

Chapter 3
D-Dad? Mom? Big bro?
Is… Is it okay if I leave for a moment when I have time off from work…?


Good morning!
Excuse me, I’d like vegetables! Anything is fine, as long as it isn&#39;t eggplants!

good mooorning~ i would like some [fish]~♪

Huh!? What are you two doing…?
Umm… Repayment Festival has already started… Are you sure it&#39;s okay not to go and support Tetora-kun and Sengoku-kun…?
They&#39;re doing their very best to repay you, y&#39;know…?

Yep! Of course we plan to go and support them!
But before that, we&#39;re warming up, since Repayment Festival lasts for a long time! And as we were thinking of doing that, we decided to drop by here!

you do not have fish?
mmh~ what you have is pretty [bad], isn’t it…?

We&#39;re a greengrocer store, after all… If you want fish, then there’s a shop for it right across the street… Go buy all the fish you like over there…

i see, i may go do that. it is the [morning] so the [fishies] must be [fresh], too.
i would like to [eat] some while it is still tasty~♪

You can&#39;t eat it as it is, Kanata! You need to prepare it first, okay? Although, I think there are shops selling food on that street!

Today, they’ve set up stalls around the shopping district and even have special menus out, ‘cause they’re expecting people from Repayment Festival to come…
Every shop’s excited to make some money…
This always happens since Yumenosaki is so nearby…
Every time there’s a big DreamFes going on, I’m also dragged around to do work all over…

Mhm, so it seems. I talk to your parents often, so I’m aware of that.
For better or for worse, you really do have normal parents.
So when trying to explain to them that their son is now an idol who’s gotten fairly popular, it doesn’t really seem to sink in for them.
My parents are the same. When I tell them that I&#39;ve got a lot of jobs going on and that it&#39;s a lot of hard work, they always reply with something like “Look at you, sounding like an adult! ♪”
Parents will always see their kids as spoiled babies who can&#39;t even change their own diapers.
But don&#39;t you want to prove to them that you&#39;ve become an adult despite that? Don&#39;t you want to show them how much you&#39;ve grown?

Umm… What do you mean…? I don&#39;t really get what you&#39;re trying to say…

Well, I don&#39;t mean to look down on your work here, but it&#39;s something even a little kid could do.
But right now, in Yumenosaki, there&#39;s work that only you can do.
So go now and do it. That&#39;s all I can say — all I can ask of you.
I’m in no position to forcibly pull you by the hand anymore.
So all I can do now is hope, like how one puts hope upon a shooting star.


midori, we will do your [job] in your [place].
it looks like it is all really simple [work], something even a [child] could do.
but repayment festival is [centered] around the [underclassmen]… and because we will not be up on the [stage], we have some [free time] right now.

Um, but still… I&#39;m sure all of this is a nuisance for you. Please go and support Tetora-kun and Sengoku-kun…
I&#39;m sure there are a lot of other juniors who wanna say their thanks to you as well, not just Ryuseitai…
I feel really bad, making you two waste your time on me…

Takamine.

Fweh—?
Huh!? What is it!? Your face is way too close! You&#39;re always like this…!

Sorry. You never react much, so I always end up thinking you couldn’t hear me well.
If you don&#39;t like my face being this close, then reply back. At least go “yeah” or “mhm” back.
Don’t ignore me, it makes me sad.
Don&#39;t worry, I won&#39;t say anything that&#39;d hurt you. Though I suppose you&#39;re thinking that’s just a load of garbage, especially after all the stress that I&#39;ve put you through.

………

You don&#39;t have much time. You have to go now, they&#39;re all waiting for you.
…Leave this place to us.

But…

Takamine. I was a sickly child, so I&#39;ve done nothing but cause trouble for my family.
That&#39;s why I wanted to be a great idol — to earn money and make things easier for my parents.

I was a clumsy person, so there wasn&#39;t much I could get right—
But I was good at singing and dancing, and people have always found me likeable for some reason…
So I felt that it might suit me to be an idol.
I hastily decided that was the way that I should live — the thing that best fits with what I could do.

That was the reason at first. That&#39;s how everyone is at first. People aren&#39;t always aiming to be an idol because of a big dream or ideal.
That&#39;s why, Takamine, there&#39;s no need to look down on yourself.
I&#39;ve loved heroes since I was young, so I joined Ryuseitai because I thought it was something like that.

But the actual state of Ryuseitai was horrible… I was constantly disappointed, constantly in regret, constantly crying — crying until I couldn&#39;t anymore.
No one lives their life exactly how they thought they would.
Dreams don&#39;t even come true most of the time — though I could never say that in front of children, even if they pried my mouth open.

Everyone&#39;s like that, it&#39;s not just you… Takamine.
Everyone, everyone, gets carried into situations they don&#39;t expect throughout their life, and everyone complains, “Why is this happening to me!?”
Everyone worries about their own lives, struggling, and causing trouble to those around them.

Chapter 4
Takamine. The reason I tried to make Ryuseitai into a great, strong unit was because…
…I wanted to be able to say I was the leader of a veteran unit.
I wanted to earn points and get high marks for this unit, so that I could use it to my advantage when I graduate. That&#39;s how it was at first.
I kept only the good parts of Ryuseitai, and used it for my own sake.

But you&#39;re a considerate person, so benefiting from the unit’s value… might have felt wrong for you.
But it&#39;s not something to feel guilty about at all. That’s what units are for.
It exists so that, together, we can climb up to a place we wouldn’t be able to reach on our own.

I&#39;m not a genius like Kanata. But thanks to Ryuseitai — Thanks to everyone, I was able to make my dream come true.
I won&#39;t frown on that. I’m thankful and proud of it.

It&#39;s the same with you, Takamine; there&#39;s no need to feel guilty at all.
Was this year you spent with Ryuseitai not fun for you?
Was it nothing but a pain? Was it only irritating? Were you always unhappy?

If not, then you shouldn’t be staying here!
Run! Run now, Takamine! Isn’t there something only you can do for the sake of your beloved friends!?
This is the last time I’ll act like your superior and lecture you like a know-it-all! So don&#39;t ignore me! Listen to me!

I&#39;m begging you, Takamine, please go save my beloved comrades!
Both Nagumo and Sengoku are still struggling! They’re in grave danger and need your help!
The three of you are shining bright arrows that’ll shoot hope into people as you chase the night sky!

So go now! Run, Takamine! It’s the hero’s turn to shine! Your filler arc is over now, so go fight for the sake of your world’s peace!
Gooo, Ryusei Green! Make our wishes come true…!!

Umm……
As usual, nothing you say makes any sense… or it&#39;s like you’re shouting with so much energy that I have no idea what&#39;s going on…
But I guess I&#39;ve gotten used to it… I sort of get what you&#39;re trying to say…
…I&#39;m gonna go to Yumenosaki Academy. I dunno what I can do, but…
I’ve been pushed all the way to this point, I’d suck way too much if I cower back and run away despite all that hard work.

Yes! You&#39;re a good boy, Takamine!
Hang in there, hero! Don&#39;t lose now, hero…!! ☆

Don&#39;t shout… See, now people are probably wondering what&#39;s going on and looking at us…
There&#39;s gonna be rumors now… so depressing…

If people start saying bad things to the point where I can&#39;t live here anymore… then please take responsibility, Morisawa-senpai…

Yep! Leave it to me, I&#39;m always welcome! ☆

Does this guy even know what he’s saying…
Well whatever, I&#39;ll go now… Is it really okay to leave the greengrocer work to you two…?

Yes. Actually, your family and I have already talked it over. When I explained everything, they accepted it and even supported it.
Your family even apologized since they felt like they’ve given you a lot of grief. They’re good people. Cherish them well, Takamine.
Your brother said that if he can&#39;t become a lawyer, he&#39;ll take over the shop.
It seems like he&#39;s already thinking of a backup plan in case he can’t achieve his dream, so you should keep this in mind when you decide things.
First things first: try to do your very best as an idol. If you ever lose track of your path, or can&#39;t progress any further, then come back here.
Your family will always be here to welcome you back.
And while you two are doing your very best for your dreams, it seems like both of your parents are determined to keep the shop in top shape.
They boasted about it, saying, “No way are we gonna die before you.”
So they said, if neither you nor your brother will take over the shop…
Then they&#39;ll either pass it on to one of your relatives, or close up the shop and live their lives as old people.
You have a tough, yet warm family.

So what exactly is dissatisfying for you, Takamine?
What’s so “depressing”!? What’s making you “want to die”!? Is this really the time to be dying!? Enjoy your life to the fullest, just like your family wants you to!
Promise me that. This is my wish right now, so please make it come true, Ryuseitai.

You’re still part of Ryuseitai, aren&#39;t you…? So will you make my wish come true, too…?

Hm? I don&#39;t mind, tell me anything! I’ll do what I can!

Then please make sure you two come back to Yumenosaki later, okay?
Repayment Festival is for saying thanks to our seniors, so if you’re not there, it’ll be a little awkward…
And from what I understood from Anzu-san, we may have a present for you that you&#39;ll enjoy a lot…

Hm? Anzu? What about her? Actually, aren&#39;t we supposed to be the ones to give her something on White Day?

Yes… That&#39;s all the more reason why you have to come to the live show…
It’s something even Anzu-san would enjoy; an unbelievable unfolding of events straight from a tokusatsu awaits you…♪

Chapter 1

    Location: Basketball Court


………

Ta~kamin? Why’re you so spaced out? You tired?
Then again, you’re always like that! Ahahahaha! ☆

………

…Heyy~? At least answer me! Let’s communicate with each other!

Fwah? Ohh, sorry, Akehoshi-senpai… I’m always up early, so I get sleepy by this hour…

Oh~? Are you a li’l kid or something? Ahaha! ☆
I get up early in the morning too, ‘cause I have to walk Daikichi! We’re the same, huh? Isn’t it so nice to share something in common?[1] ♪

Hah… Umm, well, my family owns a greengrocer store, so… They always make me help out every morning with preparation, like lining up the vegetables for sale…
Even when I stay asleep, they just force me to wake up… Though I can’t sleep much either way ‘cause of all the noise downstairs…
We live in the shopping district, so it’s really lively in the morning…

Oh yeah~ You help out at home, huh? That’s amazing! Lemme praise you! There, there, there~♪

Please don’t pat my head… You’re as insanely touchy-feely as that, aren’t you…?
You’re both so similar, it’s almost like you’re brothers…

As touchy-feely as “that”…? Ohh, do you mean Chi~chan-senpai? Aww come on, no need to say something so vomit-inducing as that, y’know! ☆

I didn’t go that far!?

Ahaha. Sometimes I do wish I could be more like Chi~chan-senpai, though. But there’s just no way I could get along with anyone and everyone the same way he does.

I know, right… I mean, he doesn’t even mind connecting with people who don’t really fit in, like you and me…
He’s basically kind to just about anyone, isn’t he…

Whoa, you just grouped us together, didn’t you? Into the “zero friends” group! You little rascal~! Don’t lump me with you~!

Ehhh…? First you say you’re glad we share something, now you’re annoyed we do…?
I don’t get you… What did you want, anyway…?
I doubt you have any interest in me… I know we’re in the same club, but we haven’t really ever talked to each other, have we…?

Mm~… That’s ‘cause ever since you came to school, Chi~chan-senpai’s only had his eyes on you, soo~
Maaaybe I’m a little jealous or something…♪

Huh…? What does that mea—

Akehoshi! Takamine! What’s up, what’re you guys up to!? Are you sitting around and having a nice chat!? Sounds fun! Make some space for me! ☆

Gah!? Hey, watch it… Please don’t jump on me out of nowhere… You almost broke my spine…

Yeah! We’re used to it by now, but you’d get arrested if you hugged a stranger out of nowhere, y’know?
Officer~! This man is a pervert!


Heh! ♪ It’s still a little chilly, so you’ll start to feel cold if you don’t move around!
That’s why your senior decided to be considerate and share his warmth with you through a hug! Squeeze, squeeze~☆

Actually, it’s freezing cold… A farewell party’s fine and all, but why’re we having it outside…?
I feel like it would’ve been better if we had it in a restaurant, or at least inside the gym with the heater on…
Basketball courts are small anyway, so it’s really crowded and suffocating with this many people around…

What’s that? You’re in pain, Takamine!? Alright then, let me perform the lifesaving technique I learned from Kanata! I’ll give you oxygen through mouth-to-mouth…☆

Gahhh!? Get your face away from me, you weirdo! I’ll seriously call the police…!

You haven’t been drinking or anything, have you, Chi~chan-senpai?

Nope! I’m underage! I think I’m just getting a little too excited!
Ahh, I can’t control myself! I feel like hugging and kissing every single person I see!

You better cut it out soon, or I’ll tie you up with rope…

Oh, that sounds like the perfect hero crisis! I’m intrigued! But I’d rather you refrain from doing that for now!
For you see, as a final parting, we’re having a match between the graduates and underclassmen!
We’re on a basketball court, after all! Doing nothing but eating snacks and chatting would be a little too sad, right?
This is the Basketball Club’s farewell party, so let’s play basketball!
Fuhaha! You guys should also change into your uniforms and join us! Let’s have a final showdown! Come on now, let me feel your growth firsthand…☆

Mm~… Sounds tiring, so I’ll pass…
I’m annoyed enough that you dragged me here when I’m not even the type to go to parties…

Oh, sure. I’m in!
Heh… I’m gonna give you a good beating as payback for everything you put me through the past two years… Chi~chan-senpai~♪

Ooh, I’m excited to see you try! I won’t be beaten by a fledgling so easily, Akehoshi! ♪
You should join us, Takamine. I’d be happy if you could at least cheer me on.
This might be the last time you see me in a basketball uniform in all my glory, y’know? Make sure you burn it straight into your very eyes! Fuhahaha! ☆

Ehhh… I feel like if that was burned into my retinas, I’d never be able to get a good night’s sleep again…

Chapter 2

    Location: Corridor


(Ugh, it’s already dark outside…)
(Our farewell party ended up going on for a really long time…)
(Ahh, I’m so sleepy… I just wanna go home and melt into my bed…)
(Uuu~ It’s so dark… The school at night feels way too creepy…)
(But since Morisawa-senpai dragged me over to the farewell party—)
(I ended up leaving my bag in the classroom, so I have to go back and get it…)

(But man… I’m seriously so tired…)
(I don’t even like wild parties in the first place… and I still got forced into playing a bunch of matches…)
(Basketball is, well… I mean, it’s kinda starting to be fun for me, but… I prefer not to move around so much…)
(It’s tiring… I feel exhausted just watching people play…)

(As tiring as it is to have so many people in the club, it ended up being in my favor this time, ‘cause I barely got a chance to do anything…)
(Everyone wanted to have a final match with Morisawa-senpai, I guess…)
(All the underclassmen are fond of him, after all… The only ones who rebelled were me and Akehoshi-senpai…)
(Maybe I should’ve been a little nicer to him before everything was over…)
(But I dunno, even that feels waaay too late… I should leave that to the juniors who were always attached to him, in that “I love Morisawa-senpai! ♪” way…)
(Especially since it was kinda like I was always keeping “everyone’s Morisawa-senpai” to myself… )
(Considering we share the same club and unit, and all… Man, why did he get so involved with me, anyway…?)
(Meh, anyway… I was expecting something way more sad for the farewell party, but…)
(It was just a ridiculously cheerful atmosphere from start to end…)

(Morisawa-senpai was also laughing the whole time…)
(I thought he was gonna make us all cry with a big speech retelling our past memories or something…)
(But in the end, nobody shed a single tear — everyone was just laughing until their whole bodies hurt… It didn’t really feel satisfying somehow…)
(Well, it’s not like we’re parting by death or anything, so I guess this is how it goes…?)

(Hmm…? Wait, huh? The lights are on in the gym…?)
(Is the club having some kind of after-party…? I bet they still don’t wanna part ways… Man, they’re so energetic…)
(Wait, no, it’s too quiet for that… Weird, did they just forget to turn off the lights…?)
(Uuu~ It’s so hard for me to shake off these kinda thoughts… Maybe I’ll grab my bag quickly, and then take a quick look on my way home…)
(And anyway, if there really is someone from the club around, I’d like them to go home with me… I’m too scared to walk alone at night…)


    Location: Gym


………

(Mm… Huh…? There’s nobody here…)
(Then why’re the lights on…? Did they really just forget to turn them off…?)
(What a waste of electricity… Let’s see, where was the light switch in the gym…?)
(I think I touched it a few times during my basketball activities…)

…………

(…Eep!? Huh!? Morisawa-senpai!?)
(W-Why’s he just standing in the corner, all spaced out…? I almost let out a weird sound ‘cause I thought I saw a ghost…)

…………

(Huh…? Is he… crying…?)
(His shoulders are shaking… and I can hear muffled sobs, too… Huh? What’s going on…?)
(Why’s he crying all alone in the gym in the middle of the night…?)

(Ahhh… I feel like I saw something I shouldn’t have… I-I gotta leave before he notices me…)
(I don’t want him pestering me like he usually does…)
(It’s not very heroic of me to leave someone crying all alone, though…)
(Wait, no… I may be a member of Ryuseitai, but I don’t recall ever becoming a hero…)
(And since he always wants to look cool for some reason, I don’t think he’d want anyone to see him crying anyway…)


…………

(…………)
(Morisawa-senpai.)
(What’s wrong?)
(You’re always smiling and laughing, while yelling about stuff that makes no sense… You’re over-enthusiastic and constantly bothering everyone with everything you do, aren’t you…?)
(It’s not like you to sob like that… You know that, right, Senpai?)

Chapter 3
…Hmm? Ohh, that surprised me!
So it was you, Takamine! What’s up, what’s wrong!? Are you on your way home?
You shouldn’t stay around for so long, y’know! Go back home, brush your teeth, and go to bed!

Ah—… Um, no, I just left my bag in the classroom, so…

(Huh…? I guess Morisawa-senpai wasn’t crying after all…?)
(He’s got that usual dumb-looking smile on his face… Ah wait, but there’s traces of tears around his eyes…)
(Did he just stop himself from crying and force a smile in the short time he noticed me and turned around…?)

(You’re always like this.)

What’s the matter? You don’t seem well! Are you sleepy? Sorry for keeping you up late for the farewell party!
Ah, I remember now! Weren’t you always too scared to walk alone at night? Alrighty then, let me take you back home!
Wait for me, I’ll be ready soon!
Heh! ♪ Just to let you know, I was cleaning the gym as thanks for all the wonderful memories it gave me the past three years!
Showing our gratitude is important, Takamine! Both as a hero and an idol!

Morisawa-senpai.
……Is everything alright?

Hm? Is what alright? I don’t know what you’re referring to, but worry not, Takamine! My engines are always at full throttle for the sake of protecting the peace of the world!
Fuhahaha…!! ☆

…I see.
(Ahh… I wonder why I feel this way…? Morisawa-senpai hasn’t even done anything wrong…)
(But seeing that smile of his irritates me to no end for some reason…)

(Morisawa-senpai, why’re you smiling…? You, who loves everyone and is loved by everyone in return… How can you even be smiling right now…?)
(Graduation is supposed to be something upsetting, so agonizingly lonely and sad…)
(Yet… Are you really gonna try and look cool while parting ways, until the very end…?)
(No… Even before all this, you’ve always been—…)

Takamine? Heeey, what’s wrong? You look like you’re feeling down…? You’re a handsome guy, so seeing you all silent and blank-faced is terrifying!

No, not really… I’m just a little tired, sleepy, and irritated…


    Location: Basketball Court


………

Heeey, Subaru! I’m guessing the farewell party’s over by now?

Sorry! I really wanted to join, but I had a ton of Student Council work to do~!
You know how the Repayment Festival is in two weeks? And how unit activities’ll mainly be done by the second-year students starting with that festival, yeah?
Since everyone’s so new to this, there’s been a lotta trouble, and I’ve been busy dealing with it.
And to top it off, both the president and vice president are seriously thorough when it comes to these things…
So now I’ve been handed over all the tasks, and have been entrusted with full authority. They won’t even give me any advice!
It’s like, completely up to us underclassmen now. I feel like we have a very bleak future ahead of us at this rate, but I’d like to adapt to it somehow as soon as possible.

Ahaha, wow, Sally~ It’s not every day I see you complain, huh?

Lemme vent a little~ I have to act like the big guy now, as the next Student Council President…
So I’m always presenting myself as a proper leader and stuff when I’m at the Student Council office.

If the boss complains, the subordinates are just gonna get anxious, right?
So, I’ve been holding it back and working through everything as fast as I can, but I guess a lotta those worries started building up inside me.

Ohh~ Seems rough for you. There, there, let me pat your head~♪
Ahaha, it sounds busy at the Student Council, too. Good work out there!
Trickstar’s a unit of only second-year students, so nothing’s really changed for us. It’s pretty peaceful actually.
But the other units are bustling with stuff they need to get done, huh?

Like, I wonder what Ryuseitai’s gonna do, since they won’t be able to say their signature line, “The five of us together~” anymore.
And like, today… From what I could tell, Chi~chan-senpai and Takamin were both acting a little off.
So since I was kinda worried, I tried my best to talk to them, but…
I’m just not good at that sorta stuff. I’m impressed that Chi~chan-senpai can do it so easily. And you too, Sally~♪

Haha, it’s fun taking care of people. At the same time though, the more attached you get, the harder it is to say goodbye.
It gets unbearably gloomy around this time, and it sucks.

Yeah. But well, we can’t stop the clock, can we… The least we can do is part ways properly—
And to say goodbye with a smile, so that our seniors won’t have any regrets when they leave.

It’s pretty hard to do it right, though~ Takamin is terrible at smiling, for one thing.
On the other hand, Chi~chan-senpai’s smiling a lot more than he used to last year. …Aren’t those two kiiinda similar?

Really? I personally think they’re the exact opposite… What kinda world do you have to be in to perceive it that way~?
Well anyways, it’s pretty late by now, so let’s go home.
We were supposed to hand gifts to our seniors in the club today… Since we promised we’d buy them together.
But I’ve been so busy that even that got delayed… I feel really bad.

It’s fine, really! As long as we make it before they graduate.
This wouldn’t have been the right timing for emotional graduation gifts anyway…
It was pretty much the usual fooling around we do in the club… It’s almost hard to believe that even that will no longer be the usual for us soon.

Hey Sally~, graduation really does suck… Even I have to push myself to smile all the time.

Content Warning: Casual mentions of marine life euthanasia.


    Location: Marine Life Clubroom


(Humming) ~……♪
puka, puka…♪

Heyaa~! I’m bored so I came over to hang out! ☆
Hm? Ohh, Kanata-kun! You look like you’re in a good mood~♪

heyaa~… i am not particularly in a [good] mood, kaoru.
i am actually pretty [irritated]. it is very [noisy] outside.

Ahh, yeah, while I was on my way over here, I saw the Basketball Club having a farewell party for their third years.
They’re in that basketball court outside.
They were partying pretty hard, so I guess the noise is reaching all the way here. Moricchi’s stupidly loud, after all.

moricchi… you are talking about chiaki, yes?
ufufu, you started [calling] him by that name at some point. it is [wonderful] to see you two getting along~ i am almost jealous.

Heh, if you’re so jealous, maybe I’ll start calling you “Kanacchi”~♪

please do not joke around.

Ehhh…!? Sorry, was that overly-friendly? Mmm~ I don’t really get what sets you off…

hehe… i am just joking, [kaocchi]~♪

Ehh~? Man, you’re always messing with me…
I don’t really want people to get too friendly with me, so I’d rather you keep calling me by my first name.

I know it’s my own fault, but everyone’s been kinda keeping their distance from me…
I mean, not even my family talks to me without attaching an honorific to my name.

wouldn’t a girl gladly call you “kaoru”?

Yeah, I always tried to make sure that girls would call me like that as much as possible. It sure makes me wonder what was going on deep inside my head…
But lately I’ve been thinking a lot about stuff, and, well… I’ve stopped meeting up with girls now.
At this point, the only comfort I get is from you and Anzu-chan.

eh~… that is not something i can really help with.
if you want [emotional comfort], i recommend gazing at the [fishies] and [jellyfishies]. we call it [aquatherapy]. puka, puka…♪

Mm, yeah. I guess looking at them through the fish tank does give me some comfort now.
It took all the way until graduation season, but I think I’m finally starting to understand your feelings, Kanata-kun.

really? it feels a little less [lonely] to have someone share the [same feelings] as me.

Mhm… But, uh, they really are loud out there, huh? I feel like I can’t chill out; that party is going off the rails.
Knowing the kinda person Moricchi is, parting ways must be kinda sad for him. I wonder if he’s balling his eyes out…

chiaki won’t cry.
fufu, how about we call souma over and have our own [farewell party] for the [marine life club]?
i would like to [hand] the [fish tanks] over to souma’s care, as well.

Mm~… Thing is, I think he hasn’t been showing up lately…? My classmate Hasumi-kun’s been freaking out about him. I don’t think anybody knows where he is right now.

is that so? i wonder what is wrong… souma gets restless very easily, so it is [worrying].

I’m sure he’ll be alright, won’t he? He’s a tough kid when it comes down to it. We can always just support him as his seniors if he’s ever in trouble.
Heh, I’d like to do something upperclassman-like for once~♪

fufu, that’s true~ let’s do something that will make him return the favor someday. i also would like to ask him to [look after] the [fish tanks] starting next year.
but it may be far too many for him to [take care] of all on his own…
so as sad as it may be, i will have to [euthanize] half of them.

Wh—Did you just say euthanize!? No, don’t! They’re living creatures; you can’t just throw them away like that…!
You say some shockingly cold-hearted things sometimes, Kanata-kun…

fufu. we are the [children] of [monsters], after all.
it is [unnatural] for a sea creature to live on land.
if one will only cause trouble, and only be a burden… that means it is time to say [goodbye], yes?

No, no! It’s completely natural for us to cause trouble and burden each other! That’s how everyone lives, including you and I.
If you hold yourself back from everyone, you won’t even be able to breathe.
And you hate being suffocated — don’t you, Kanata-kun?

………

Besides, if it’s too hard for Souma-kun to manage the aquarium by himself, how about we show up again after graduation then?
I’ll probably be a little busy with work, but I could swing by every once in a while to pass the time~♪
Let’s keep visiting him over and over like shameless graduates, until the club gets new members.
So yeah, no need to force yourself to get rid of stuff and say goodbye to avoid being a “nuisance,” right?
Well, I’m in no position to say that, considering I’m still in the middle of sorting out my own personal matters. …Life’s always easier said than done, huh? ♪

Chapter Index
Ch 1 - Ch 2 - Ch 3 - Ch 4 - Translation Notes





Chapter 1

    Location: Shopping District


Nagumo! Takamine! What’s the matter!? What happened here!?
Sengoku was unusually distraught, and his explanation didn’t quite make sense!

But there’s no need to worry anymore! Now that the burning heart Morisawa Chiaki has come to your rescue, all your troubles will be instantly shattered!
We’ll all have a happy ending together with smiles on our faces! Fuhahahaha!! ☆

…………

…Taichou. I’m sorry, but please stay outta this.

No need to act so distant with me, Nagumo! I wasn’t intending on intruding too much, but this is an emergency, right?
The five of us together are Ryuseitai! Let’s solve our problems and worries together!

I’m so sorry! I’ve been so preoccupied with my own matters that I ended up neglecting you guys!
If you’re angry, then throw your anger at me! Grab me by the collar and beat me up! It’s my well-deserved punishment…!
But please, end the fighting with that! What’s the use in fighting amongst your own comrades!?

See, it’s ‘cuz you’re so naive that—… No, now’s not the time to be blamin’ you.
It’s seriously none of your business, so could you please stay out of it?
Nobody asked you to get involved. I know that’s what a hero of justice is all ‘bout, but I’d appreciate it if you refrained from butting in this once.
Within school, not being able to read the room is equivalent to evil, y’know?

—Ahh… I can’t believe I called you of all people evil… I really do need to calm down, huh…

midori~? tetora~? are you two alright?

Oh! You’ve arrived, Kanata. Sorry for running off on my own.

that is the [usual].

…midori, are you really [okay]? are you crying? what happened?

…………

there, there. you are a good boy, so don’t cry, okay…?

Nagumo. I don’t want to think you would, but did you hit Takamine by any chance? You shouldn’t resort to violence!

Please don’t just assume things. I wouldn’t hit him. …I’d only dirty my fists if I punched a spoiled brat like him.

…………

Why don’t you say something already, huh? We’re not done talkin’ here!
Or what, are you just gonna cower away and pretend nothing’s happening!? Are you just gonna sit there, hoping for that kind somebody to swoop in and solve all your problems for you!?

C-Calm down already, Nagumo! Why are you so angry!? Take a deep breath!

T-Taichou-dono~? Shinkai-dono~? I finally caught up with you!
Both of you rushed straight to the scene before I could get to the details…

Sengoku! You’re here just in time — explain the situation!
Hm? Even Anzu is here? Is that a first aid kit in your hand? Did you go somewhere to fetch it?
D-Did someone get hurt after all…? Nagumo seems to be unharmed, so is Takamine the one who got hit?
I’ll help patch him up! Stand up, Takamine! Show me where it hurts!
I often get injured during my stunt work, so I know how to treat small injuries!

Ugh, you’re so loud… I’m not injured anywhere, okay… You’re all panicking way too much…

Then why are you crying? Anzu, Sengoku, please give me a full report of what happened!

I’m so sorry! It’s all my fault for neglecting you guys this whole time!
However, I truly believed that you would be able to overcome any and all difficulties by yourselves!

Well… This must be a disappointin’ sight then. I’m sorry.
The situation is real simple. Anzu-Anego asked me if we, Ryuseitai, were gonna participate in Repayment Festival.
But to be honest, I thought we wouldn’t be able to.

‘Course, deep down, I absolutely wanna join the festival. I wanted to show my gratitude and return the favor to all the seniors I’m indebted to.
The reason I got to live my life proudly without ever losing heart was all thanks to Taishou and my seniors in Ryuseitai, after all.

I wanted to give ‘em peace of mind by showing ‘em just how much I’ve grown. That’s what Repayment Festival is for.
It’s a farewell ceremony that begins and ends with a bow.[1]
I wanted to make sure I could do that properly. …It’s sad to part ways, but throwin’ a tantrum won’t change anything.
I wanted to wipe my tears away, so that I can at least say my goodbyes with a smile.

But… that’s just how I feel. I can’t force others to feel that way, too.
If I just go ahead on my own like I always do, I’d only cause trouble for everyone.
That’s why I first started by asking Midori-kun the other day, since we’re in the same class.
I wanted to see if he wanted to join, and if he thinks he can manage it.

He replied the same way he always does.
“I can’t do it”, “I don’t wanna”, “It’s a pain”, “Why me…?” — It’s gotten so tiring hearin’ this stuff over and over the entire past year. Midori-kun, you really don’t have any motivation, do you?
I understand why, though. After all, you signed up for the idol course by accident, right?
You never wanted to become an idol in the first place, right?

So scolding you so harshly, pushing you to do stuff, and forcefully dragging you back in when you’re so unmotivated would just be cruel. That’s exactly what Taichou always did, though.

Chapter 2
Taichou would always pretend to be a terrible, insensitive person — giving you pep talk after pep talk, and pulling you on stage even though you hated it.
That became an everyday occurrence in Ryuseitai.

So, Midori-kun… You may have thought to yourself that the same would happen again this time around, but…
Those easy-going days of ours are in the past.
Taichou and Shinkai-senpai’ll graduate, and there’s nothing we can do &#39;bout that. We should celebrate that — we should be congratulating them.
From now on, we gotta do things on our own.

We can’t keep on relying on our seniors. We can&#39;t keep on pushing all&#39;a the blame and responsibilities onto &#39;em—
And then snatch only the good parts from &#39;em.
That’s just shameful. I was the same, too, y&#39;know? I put all the dirty work and heavy burdens on Taishou and my other seniors…
I was a stupid, dumb brat who relished in his own ignorance.

But we’ll become seniors, too. We have to grow up at this point.
We can&#39;t just continue being naïve kids who rely on kind heroes to carry &#39;em into the spotlight.

And yet! Despite all that, you keep going, “I don’t wanna, it’s a pain”! “So depressing, I wanna die”!
What more do you want when you’re already so incredibly blessed!?

………

And then, when Anego and Shinobu-kun once again asked me what we planned to do for Repayment Festival…
I realized that I really didn&#39;t wanna let it go, either, so I came all the way to Midori-kun’s home.
I thought that if we talked it through, he’d understand. No, I truly believed that he felt the same way.

But I was wrong. Y&#39;know, I really can&#39;t do what Taichou does.
I just don’t have it in me to sacrifice myself for another person&#39;s sake — especially if it meant I&#39;d be hated and found annoying &#39;cuz of it.
I can&#39;t do all&#39;a that just to drag Midori-kun along by force.
That&#39;s why, when he refused to continue talkin&#39; to me after a while, I just couldn&#39;t say anything anymore.

I felt really pathetic and got irritated… I even grabbed him by the collar, and… We ended up fighting.
Taichou has always entrusted me with his role whenever he&#39;s not around…
And I knew I’d be the one to inherit the red color, so I had a bit of confidence in myself.
But every bit of confidence I had is completely gone now — broken and shattered to pieces. I feel like a failure. I can’t even solve a dispute within my own group of people. Saving the world isn&#39;t possible for me.
I still don&#39;t have what it takes to be Ryusei Red.

That’s not true, Nagumo.
Even I failed over and over at the start. I couldn&#39;t get anything right at all — to the point where just seeing the red color made me feel sick.
I started to feel that tokusatsu shows were nothing but lies — that there was no way anything could conveniently go well the same way it did in the shows.
I cursed the heroes I loved, and there were even nights when I cried myself to sleep.

But I still picked myself back up every time… I pushed myself to solve through each and every problem. I struggled and struggled until I could call myself a man worthy of inheriting the red color.
I still don’t even know if I did everything right. There’s no hero out there who has failed as many times as I have.
Anyone would have felt too disheartened to continue watching and would have changed the channel before the story could have reached its climax.

But that’s only my story. Yours is still in the preview phase.
You’ll always have a chance to recover, and your future is dazzling bright. So don’t give up, Nagumo.

If you give up now, then everything will be all over. After I graduate… What will I be able to wake up to every Sunday?[2]
A world without heroes is the same as a world without a sun!

So hang in there! Don’t lose now! Don’t give up! Stand back up, hero!
It’s frustrating that all I can do is cheer you on from a distance, but! If I tried to interfere now, it wouldn&#39;t benefit you at all!
So I will refrain and instead I will yell this!
Nagumo! Takamine! Sengoku! Hit me! If you have any problems, then hit me with every one of them right here, right now! Beat me up as you please!
I’ll be fine! I’m used to getting hurt! But I can’t bear to watch you fight and hurt each other!
The pain is worse than dying! It would be less painful if you just hit me instead!
I’ll take all your anxiety, your pain — everything! And then I&#39;ll toss it all into the sun, causing a huge explosion, and we&#39;ll then have our happy ending!

Haha. If I hit you for real, you’d die, Taichou.
Well, either way… I understand how you feel. …I won’t blame you anymore, Midori-kun.
I won’t unfairly get angry, so please talk to me.

We&#39;re both the same age, and I don&#39;t plan to inherit Ryusei Red and Taichou&#39;s seat &#39;til our seniors have graduated.
For now, we’re equal members of this unit, so I can’t order you around as if I know better than you.

Although, I don’t think it’s good for me to hold back like that…
It’s just — I don’t have that kinda confidence in myself yet. I’m still hollow. One day, I’ll become a great man for sure—
But right now, it’s still difficult for me. So, expecting me to act just like Taichou… It’s impossible.
If you refuse me, then I won’t be able to say anything further.

But. Even as your friend, I just can’t understand.
You told me again today — The reason you don’t feel like doing Repayment Festival is &#39;cuz, on that day—
You have to help out at the greengrocer store, right?
Apparently, there’ll be stalls put up on the same day as the festival. So your parents told you to help out with that, right?
And so, you can’t participate &#39;cuz you’re gonna be busy with that.

I get that. For the sake of your family — for the greengrocer store — you always worked hard despite all your complaints.
We even made advertisement signboards for &#39;em together, right? That’s a very precious memory for me, too.[3]

Chapter 3
But I just don’t understand. Is that really somethin&#39; only you can do, Midori-kun?
Do you really gotta help &#39;em out that badly? Isn’t your family in good health?
If they are, then they should be fine without your help.

But Repayment Festival is our chance to thank our seniors from Ryuseitai for everything they’ve done for us this year. We may never get this chance ever again.
This is somethin&#39; only the three of us can do. Nobody else can do this.
So why&#39;re you prioritizing the store over that?

I just can’t for the life of me understand why. So I got angry, and then things got even more blurry… My mind went blank and I just snapped.
I apologize for that. I’m sorry. But I still really don’t get it.
Is it &#39;cuz it’s sad to say goodbye? Or is it &#39;cuz you’re too embarrassed to thank your seniors for everything face-to-face?
Is it &#39;cuz you can’t stand doing somethin&#39; embarrassing?
So you decided to help out your family instead — the people in your comfort zone? You wanted to avoid any hardships or painful situations, so you chose the easy way out?

If so, that’s just irritating. I’ve always hated that part &#39;bout you.
You&#39;re always such a coward! You&#39;re just a spineless wimp!
It’s like I’m lookin&#39; at my old self! It irritates me so much!

I’m sorry, but I guess I really am angry!
I just don’t have the same kind of unwavering tolerance as Taishou or Taichou!

But y&#39;know, Midori-kun… Let me ask you something! Exactly what was this whole year to you?
Taichou went to pick you up every day!
He was always there to help you get through the day, even though you had zero motivation! Did all&#39;a that effort he spent, running around and encouraging you, just go to waste?
He completely used up his last precious year in high school just to try and hone our skills, y&#39;know! Are you saying all&#39;a that was just a waste of time?

No… Actually, was it too much pressure for you? Or was all&#39;a that help too irritating? Was it all just a nuisance to you?
All of your non stop whining and complaining —
I was hoping that was just you being embarrassed, that deep down it might&#39;ve all meant somethin&#39; to you!

But if you’re telling me that all of it was just a waste, that you really meant it when you said you hated everything and wanted to die…
Then what was Taichou’s whole year for!?
I know that nobody asked him to do any of that — that he’s the one who decided to do all of that on his own — If that’s what you’re thinking, it’s true! But the way you’ve been acting is just too much!

He was expecting so much from you! You, who’s so much more talented than me! So much more handsome than me!
To be honest, as one of your classmates, it makes me super jealous!
I wish I could’ve been born to look like you! I’m sure Taichou feels the same way!
We were so envious and so captivated by you! We wanted to see you shine even more!

But all along, were we just pushing our own selfish wishes onto you?
Was it all seriously just a huge bother to you? &#39;Cuz if it was, then you should’ve said so a long time ago!
Sure, you never wanted to be an idol in the first place — you joined this course by accident — you can’t keep up with this hero act!
I get it, you say it all the time! I’m sick and tired of hearing it!


If that was really the case — If you really hated it that much—!
You should’ve left before you ate away an entire year of his life! You should’ve quit everything and just disappeared!
No one would’ve stopped you! You should’ve gotten up and left, and gone right back to your peaceful life at the greengrocer store!
You shouldn’t have waited all the way &#39;til this point, when everything’s ending! After being spoiled and helped by &#39;em time after time! All while making a face like you didn&#39;t wanna, but there was nothing you could do &#39;bout it!
All after being loved and protected and blessed with so much, all &#39;cuz of &#39;em!
They helped you so much, and you owe &#39;em so much, but you refuse to pay that back? Just &#39;cuz you can’t bother yourself to do something you don’t like?
Hey, Midori-kun… Just how long do you plan to keep being a little brat!?

…Stop already, Nagumo. Please don’t fight, I’m begging you.

[do not] stop them, chiaki~ it is [necessary] that they experience this.
these children were always [good kids]. they never fought, and only listened to what they were told. they were obedient and lively…

but they cannot stay as [children] forever.
they can walk on their [own], without us [carrying] them in our arms. and all we can do is believe in that, as we [watch over] them.
if you were to spoil them right now… they would surely become unable to walk by themselves [forever].

on this [land], being unable to [walk] is the same as being unable to [live].
looong ago, the one who told me that was you… wasn&#39;t it?

………

…Takamine. I want to hear how you truly feel. I won&#39;t know if you don&#39;t say anything. Was it really all a nuisance?
Did I really just cause you suffering throughout this whole year?

If so, I’m sorry. I’m so sorry. I’ll give you a proper apology, and I’ll do anything I can to make it up to you.
I won&#39;t mind if you think of our meeting as nothing but an unfortunate accident and forget it ever happened.

If that’s what would give you relief and make you smile again, then I’m fine with that… because your smile is the greatest treasure in this whole world.
I would always look forward to making your smile shine at its brightest. But if I was truly just a nuisance to you all along, then… I apologize. I’m so sorry, Takamine.

Chapter 4
…………
I’m pretty sure I’ve always said this before, though… That you’re annoying, that I don’t wanna do any of it, that it’s all a pain… But you never, ever listen…
Morisawa-senpai… Is there really anything worthwhile about me…?
I never stood out until high school… I was just a normal student…
Sure, I was extremely tall, and I look like this… so girls would sometimes be interested in me…
But inside, I’m nothing special… As soon as anyone talks to me, they realize the truth and are instantly disappointed…

I thought the same thing would happen with you… I thought you’d get disappointed and lose all interest in someone like me…
Something like that is only natural… That’s why I always had an escape ready…
The only notable thing about me is my appearance… There’s no way anyone could ever love me for who I really am…
The only people who wouldn’t eventually leave me are my family…

So is it really that strange that I wanna devote myself to my family — to the greengrocer store…?
Ryuseitai may be like a family, but you’re not actually my parents or my siblings!
And anyway, it was only by mistake that I took the idol course in the first place… Then I somehow managed to pass it, and in the end I had no choice but to go to this academy…
I’ve always just wanted to run away from everything I can&#39;t stand… It’s painful and scary… School exams in particular are tough and ridiculously awful…
All I wanted was to get through this course as easily as possible…

I’m only here out of dumb luck! I shouldn’t be here when there are so many others who would love to be in my place!
I don’t deserve to be loved by so many people! I don’t deserve to feel the blessings of being an idol!
And anyway, it&#39;s not like I can continue being an idol for the rest of my life…
Only a few people could ever do that… You’d need to want it with all your heart…
But I’m not like that… I just chose the easiest path… I have no will at all compared to everyone else…
Someone like me would be immediately driven out of a place as cruel as the show business…


Everyone had such high hopes for me, but I just can’t do it…
I’ve always felt terrible about it… I felt so guilty… I’ve always wondered if it really is okay for someone like me to even be here…
After all, everyone else is so serious about this! They’re all trying to be idols with everything they’ve got! But I’ve never been like that — Right from the start, it was all just a big mistake!
Someone like me shouldn’t even try to be an idol! There’s no way I could make it as an idol for the rest of my life!
From the moment I was born until the day I die — I will always, always just be the son of a greengrocer!
Yumenosaki — Ryuseitai was a once-in-a-lifetime dream for me!
But there’s a lot more to life — once I’ve woken up from that dream, I have to keep on living!
But my big brother has an actual dream! He wants to be a lawyer! And he studies every day for it!
He’s tried over and over to pass the exam and he’s failed every time — cried and suffered every time — yet he keeps working hard for it!

I wanna support my brother! I wanna at least be able to tell him that I’ll be the one to take over the shop, so that he can keep working hard for his dream!
That’s why I’m helping out at the shop! Exactly what is wrong with that!?
I don’t have any real dreams! So at the very least, I don’t wanna ruin someone else’s chance to achieve theirs!
I can’t get in the way of something like that! I should be huddled in a corner somewhere far away where I can’t do any damage!
Becoming an idol? Becoming a hero? It’s amazing, I think it’s incredible!
But not everyone is as incredible as you guys!
Normal people have lives, too! You think they can just keep chasing after their dreams!? Because I can’t! Just the thought of it is terrifying!

And yet, you go ahead and put all your hopes into someone pathetic like me!
I feel like a horrible, miserable person for making Morisawa-senpai waste a whole year of his life on me!
Did you know? He was so upset about leaving that he cried all alone where no one could see him!
But he intended to hide those tears from us to the very end!
He wanted to say goodbye with a smile, as a hero — and to leave us with nothing but happy memories!

Are you insane!? That’s way too cool! What are you, some kind of saint!?
And I—! I wasted an entire precious year of someone as amazing as that…!
I could never say goodbye with pride like you two!
“I owe you a lot for this year, please leave the rest to us”? As if I even have the right to say that!

I can’t do it! To me, something like Repayment Festival is just—…
There’s no way I could ever repay all that kindness in one day — in one “thank you” as we part ways!
It’d be impossible even if I devoted my whole life to it! It’s just not possible for me, Tetora-kun!
It’s just as you said… I should’ve gotten up and left much earlier…

But I had so much fun… Being with all of you always made me so happy… It was a dazzling and bright youth I never ever thought I&#39;d get to experience…
I loved everyone from Ryuseitai… And that’s exactly why it’s so awful of me to be the way I am…
In the end, I’m just a fraud! A dull, fake idol!

I’m so sorry… If you’ve gotten sick of me now, then feel free to throw me out and ignore me forever…
Go and join the festival without me…
It’s just impossible for me… I don’t have the right… I’m sorry, I’m sorry, I’m so sorry……

Ch 1 - Ch 2 - Ch 3 - Ch 4 - Ch 5 - Ch 6
Chapter 1
Location: Comet Show Stage


“♪~♪~♪”
(hmmm~…)

“♪~♪~♪”

(it looks like tetora and shinobu are in perfect shape. we haven’t had many opportunities to sing together as the five of us ever since this year started—)
(and i’m sure they’re emotionally struggling to stay concentrated right now, what with everything that’s been happening…)
(but they’re performing as best as they can, without ever expressing those gloomy feelings.)
(you’re both shining so bright.)
(you two grew to be so strong, and became such wonderful heroes.)
(would my life have been different if the whole of mankind was like you, too…?)
(would it have turned out differently if everyone in this world was capable of fighting against evil without ever relying on any god…?)
(………)

…? What’s wrong, Shinkai-senpai? This is meant to be the grand finale for you seniors—It’s the last time we’ll get to see you perform at your best in Ryuseitai, so we wanna hype you up.

Mhm, mhm! It would be pointless to have us at the front at such a crucial moment; we’d like you to show yourself to the audience!
You don’t have to watch over us in the back in case we need backup or anything—We assure you that we’ll be alright.

of course. i can see that very clearly.
to parents, their children will always be their little babies, but standing side-by-side is enough for me to tell that you’ve all grown so much.

Ossu, ‘course we have! I swore to Taishou—to everyone—that I’d grow strong enough to become a great man someday!

Heh! I may not grow taller, but I assure you my mental fortitude has strengthened enough to be on the same level as my peers! Ninja Arts, Giant Technique…!

fufu, did you learn that from mikejima or something?


(ah— i accidentally called him by his past name…)
(say, my first hero and friend—were we able to become the heroes you used to love so much, mikejima?)
(as you can see, we’re clearly a mess right now, but…)
(our children have grown so strong that i’m sure you wouldn’t ever be able to crush them, even if you tried.)
(that’s why i choose to be proud of them, if nothing else. these children have become such honest, good boys, despite being raised by a monster.)
(that might be the biggest miracle i&#39;ve ever performed in my life.)

? What are you grinning about…?

Haha, I’m more than glad you’re having a blast, though~!

mhm. fufu, i’m sorry — did i weird you two out?

Not at all.

okay. then let’s set myself aside for now… the ones i’m actually worried about are chiaki and midori. they really are running late, aren’t they? could something have happened?

Shall I withdraw for a moment to do a quick check-up on them?
We could at least know what’s holding them up if I make contact with Anzu-dono, since she was the one who helped us deliver their outfits to them.

No, it’d be best not to. I’m betting that our guests are confused about why there’s only three of us on stage right now, considering we specifically stated in our announcement that we’d be performing as the five of us for the first time in a while.
If you leave the stage now, it’s gonna make ‘em think something bad might’ve happened for real.
They came all the way here to see us perform, so we shouldn’t make ‘em worried.
Otherwise, they might end up panicking and thinking that the real reason why our seniors left Ryuseitai is ‘cuz they got fired for always making a mess, even onstage.
Like, as an example, pro wrestling also has special matches to mark a wrestler’s retirement, but in some rare cases the match clearly has an upsetting “take a guess what got us here…” feel to it.

I know nothing about pro wrestling, but considering we’ve had many terrible rumors surrounding us since summer began…
I agree that we must refrain from presenting ourselves in a false manner, so we can avoid making people feel distrustful of us.
Ahhh, how frustrating… Being unable to move as freely as possible means I’m unable to thrive through my ninja lightning speed abilities.

Ossu, I know how you feel. But complaining won’t get us anywhere, so let’s do whatever it takes to make the best out of this situation. As long as we work our hardest to make our dreams come true, nothing is impossible.
I’m sure everything’ll go just fine if we do that! Even if that&#39;s just me being idealistic, I’ll be doing the best I can to make it a reality! Ossu!

(Screen fades to black for a moment)


—Eeep!?
W-W-What is the meaning of this!? Darkness has enveloped us all of a sudden…! C-Could this be… Tetora-kun’s superpower that only manifests when he uses 100% of his power: the Black-Out Technique…!?

Huh!? That’s literally the first time I’ve ever heard of that! What do you think of me as!?

My apologies, the chuunibyou spirit within me felt a tingle at the thought.

Anyways, this is bad! It looks like something went wrong with the lighting…!

no—
this doesn’t look similar to the incident shu and his unit[1] experienced two years ago.
it’s our planetarium at work. we had one installed inside here.

P-Planetarium…?

yes. our jellyfishies and such would look even prettier illuminating the night, so we installed one to captivate our guests.

T-This aquarium really does have everything, doesn’t it…?

eheh~♪ we were financially struggling at one point[2], so we tried a whooole lot of strategies~ may we hope for that kind of effort to never be in vain.
anyway, why did the planetarium turn on suddenly…?

“ROOOOOOOOOAR!!”

EEEEEEK!?

Woah—!? Shinobu-kun, I get being spooked, but please don’t hide inside my clothes! Ah, it tickles…! What’re you, a squirrel!?

fufu, it is disgraceful for a hero to run away with their tail between their legs~

Y-You’re pretty calm, huh, Shinkai-senpai…?

i got used to huge animals because of the aquarium, after all. why, creatures here can weigh a ton, you know?

Creatures…? Ahh, you mean from the ocean? Like steller sea lions and walruses?

yes. but it looks like what’s before us right now is actually the fire-breathing type of creature.

Chapter 2

“ROOOOOOOOOOAR!!! GROOOOOOOOOWL!!”

Ohhh, you’re right! I see a kaijuu so gigantic, it could envelop the entire starry sky!
What is the meaning of this…!? Its strangely soft-looking appearance is the exact kind that Midori-kun would adore!
That’s how I can tell it must be made from CGI or something, and so—
You fiend! You must be a monster conjured through sorcery, aren’t you!? This is just the type of challenge I was hoping for…☆

Huh, so this is what they mean by “showing your true nature during a predicament”… You’re really reassuring to have in times like these, Shinobu-kun…

Eeep!? M-Midori-kun…!? You arrived so late! We were so worried for you!

Yeah, sorry about that… I had an argument with Morisawa-senpai on the way here…

A-Again…? I know it was once a trend in hero shows to fight amongst each other, but you shouldn’t be on bad terms with your fellow unit members, Midori-kun.
Close intimacy suits us best, you know!

Yup, yup. But that said, where is Morisawa-senpai anyway…? Shouldn’t he have been with you, Midori-kun?

Mm… There wasn’t enough time to pre-record the kaijuu’s part of the script, so he’s improvising it live with that stupid voice you’re hearing instead…
He looked happy when he was talking about how grateful he was for the opportunity to practice his kaijuu performance, but…
I bet he’d much rather become a hero… And let’s be real, a kaijuu role of all casting choices is the last thing his fans would consider suitable for him, sooo…
We need to get him out of that role already. The audience is probably freaking out over the blackout, anyway…
It’s about time we start explaining what’s happening here, and move on to the next plot point.
Okay, Shinobu-kun, here you go. The script.

Huh? So I just need to read this, right?

Ahaha, you’ve become the go-to guy for narration, huh? ♪

Mhm, I’m grateful for it. It feels as though my peculiar abilities are being put to great use.
…Ahem~… “The year is 20XX AD! Mankind has joined hands to surmount the threats of plague, the neverending conflicts, and any and all disasters! However, it was at that moment that a new enemy charged in to cause mayhem!”
“It was known as the Great Kaijuu, and it had only one goal in its mind: to consume the negative emotions of mankind’s fears, despair, and suffering!”
“This monster was the crystallization of the negative emotions left behind by mankind throughout the times, and even after feeding on human suffering, its very core hungered for more, and it began to terrorize the entire world!”

wow, that plot has no originality to it, don’t you think?

Of all people who’d nitpick, I didn’t expect it to be you, Shinkai-senpai… Morisawa-senpai had to rush a script out on his way here, so you’ll just have to accept the bad writing for what it is…

no, it is more like… something i can relate to.

……?

“However, mankind mustn’t give up! Where darkness may lie, let there be light! When evil surges forth, justice shall too!”


“‘I want to protect our wonderful planet!’ ‘I want to protect my loved ones!’ ‘I want to live happily forever, without any worries or anguish!’”
“It is those wishes and desires filled with positive emotions that crystalized and called upon a miracle!”
“Turning all the dreams and hopes deep inside everyone’s hearts into his strength—The warrior of justice stood up to take the stage!”

“Fuhahahaha! Fuhahaha! Fuhaaaaaha-ha-ha-ha!!!! ☆”
“The red flame is the mark of justice! Burning bright red, the sun of life!”
“I’m Ryusei Red, Morisawa Chiaki…!”

…Woah, the lights came back on so suddenly. What&#39;s this so dramatic for?

Eh, what’s the big deal… Didn’t you guys wanna make this our final parting memory or whatever? So we may as well make it unforgettable for everyone with a flashy performance…

You sound like you’ve got a problem with that, Midori-kun.


I have more than one, actually…
Well, whatever. The Great Kaijuu is carrying the entirety of mankind’s malice inside of it—and while Morisawa-senpai may put up a strong front and all, he’s too weak and dumb to win against something that massive all on his own.
As much as it pains me, I guess we’ll just have to back him up.
“The green flame is the mark of compassion!”
“The great nature, growing infinitely! Ryusei Green, Takamine Midori…!”
“Red! You’re gonna get fried in no time if you just stand there all alone! Get your ass over here! Do we have to tell you what to do every time!?”

“W-Why are you snapping at me, Green!? And watch your language! You should speak to your seniors more politely! Promise me you’ll do that, okay!?”

Umm… I’ve no idea what’s happening anymore… But that is always how it is for Ryuseitai anyway.
As a ninja, my duty is to support from the sidelines while everyone takes action as they please. That is my wish, what brings me the most joy, and what I consider my form of justice.
“The yellow flame is the mark of hope! A single miracle shining into the darkness!”
“Ryusei Yellow, Sengoku Shinobu…!”

——well then, i will join along~♪
you three have become so very reliable, but that doesn’t mean that i’m no longer needed.


in fact, now that we’ve all grown stronger, we may be able to accomplish much more valuable things than we could ever before.
no, it could go even beyond that—i feel like we could make anything happen as long as all five of us are together.
……i took too long to realize that.
“the blue flame is the mark of mystery. i have come from the blue sea~”
“and now, i’m here with all of you, living on land! ryusei blue—shinkai kanata!”

Oooh, that’s longer than the other two’s catchphrases. I don’t even know which one’s your original catchphrase at this point, but… I felt this version deep in my heart.
Man… I can’t even imagine how great it could’ve been if we could all live alongside one another.

…………

Nagumo! I’m so sorry! I accidentally called myself Red before you could speak! I’m sorry to ask this of you, but could you let me take the spotlight as your seni—

Ahaha. Can’t you see the outfit I’m wearing, Senpai?
I’ve still got ways to go before I can properly wear the the color red, and I’m painfully aware that no amount of rushing will get me there any faster.
In the meantime, I’m fine with being black for now.
I know by now that the Ryuseitai you seniors worked hard to build isn’t some “dumb” unit that tries to make one color better than the other.
So I’ll proudly yell my own catchphrase with my head held high!
“The black flame is the mark of effort! The burning fighting spirit, stained with the soil of the earth!!”
“Ryusei Black, Nagumo Tetora!”
“With the five of us together! We are Ryuseitai…!”

Chapter 3

“Let’s go, you guys! We’ll defeat the Great Kaijuu before it destroys our world!”
“We will prevail, for the sake of the Earth’s future—and for the sake of protecting everyone’s freedom and happy lives!”

… Yeah, yeah. But please stop trying to lead the team when you’re the one who arrived last, Senpai.

Oooh! Nice one, Nagumo! That sounded like something you’d hear in a crossover between Showa Riders and Heisei Riders…![3] It’s firing me up…!

There’s not that much of a generation gap between us, though…?

Exactly. We’re only two years apart, but you still act like you’re sooo much more mature than us—

W-Why are you guys being so harsh!? You keep firing off one remark after the other! But it’s fine, I guess! It reminded me of our time during Supernova!

well, i think it’s understandable that they’d scold you a little. you showed up very, very late, chiaki… and you too, midori. did something happen?
although i knew you two would come eventually, no matter what.

Yeah… I’m really sorry[4] for always being late.

no, i’d rather you were late than never arriving at all, chiaki.

Mmm~… Did it take you a while to prepare that shabby-looking CGI for that huge kaijuu or something?

Don’t call it shabby!
I mean, sure, it may look like paper-mache compared to those popular foreign movies with huge budgets, but Japan’s tokusatsu movies do the best they can too, okay!?
In fact! Tokusatsu has enough incredible technology to make even the fakest things look super realistic! They’re Japan’s pride and joy, y’know!

Huh, that description sounds exactly like you… Ahhh, so that’s why you love tokusatsu so much…

H-How did you even reach that conclusion!? I’m not made of paper-mache! And even if I was, I can assure you that I’ve been doing my absolute best to improve and polish myself, inside and out!

Well, yeah, that’s why you’re ES’s pride, and such an in-demand entertainer right now.

Mhm! If there’s anything lacking inside me, I’ll just fill it up! If I can’t do it on my own, I surely can with everyone beside me! Nothing is impossible as long as I&#39;m alive!

…Why…

Hm?

Why are you, a stupidly positive person… holding back and giving up so easily on the unit that should mean so much to you?

You’re going to bring that up again, Takamine?

hm? what are you talking about~?

Well, the truth is… Another reason we were late was because Takamine threw a tantrum.

Now you’re calling it a tantrum… Fine, so it kinda was one, but you’re just spreading misinfo and making me look bad…

Mm, I’m sorry. I swear I’m not angry at you or anything.

It’s fine… Honestly, you should be angry—It’s my fault we got here so late… I held us back during our very last stage together.
But that’s exactly what I can’t stand. I’m just so irritated, like, what do you mean our “last” stage? Are you all being serious right now…?
That’s why I just couldn’t take it anymore on our way here, after changing into our uniforms…
The moment I realized that this was even our last time changing clothes together—
Everything started to feel so suffocating that I couldn’t bring myself to move. I never ever wanted us to reach the “final” moment between us.
I don’t care about the powerless kids begging for help—I’m suffering, too!
Why’re we the only ones who have to suck it up and hold in our pain and suffering? Why do we have to keep our mouths shut with a smile for the sake of everyone else?
I couldn’t stop looping those thoughts in my head, and started to feel so angry—I just wanted to abandon everything.

Midori-kun—

I’m sorry, Tetora-kun, Shinobu-kun. I’m the only one who hasn’t changed since Repayment Festival… I haven’t grown at all. It’s all ‘cause I’ve been pampered, protected, and helped by everyone.

That’s not true, Midori-kun. You’re the one getting the most recognition through your modeling and other solo work.
Anyone who knows you could guess how much you dislike that line of work, but you still worked as hard as you could, and your efforts paid off. That’s not something just anyone can do—You’re incredible, Midori-kun.

Mm… Thanks for always being so nice to me. But I’m not venting here, and I’m not trying to get you to comfort me.
I’m saying all this ‘cause that’s the sorta pathetic guy I am—After all, I’m the one who took the longest to transform… That’s exactly why I know how it feels to be a “powerless nobody” compared to everyone else.
Unlike everyone else who can only think in tokusatsu concepts ‘cause they’ve become brainwashed by all those shows—I can think in a normal, realistic manner.

……?

Fine, sure, I did throw a tantrum. But when I couldn’t move a single muscle anymore, that idiot over there gently stretched out his hand to me.
He started telling me, “you don’t have to force yourself,” “you don’t have to do it if you don’t want to,” “you could even run away if you like.”
“You don’t have to hold yourself back, and if anybody makes a fuss, I’ll protect you from it.”
That stupid hero over there started to say stupidly heroic stuff to me.

…What else should I have done?

Nothing, you can stay that way. You’re just acting as the ideal hero you dreamed to be—
Or well, maybe saying “acting” is off. Lemme rephrase: that’s just you properly being a hero, right?
But don’t you think that’s a little odd? I mean, I’m supposed to be a hero too, aren’t I?
I’m still one, more or less. After all, all of you accepted me as one of you, despite how pathetic and slow I am.
I’m supposed to be capable of proudly saying I’m a hero.
And yet, I wasn’t able to fulfill my duty as one. Even when there was someone right in front of me acting as a role model, showing me how to do it in the simplest visual possible.
I got so frustrated as soon as I realized that…
After all, if I’m not a proper hero, then it’d turn everyone who recognizes me as one into lying frauds.
It would be like I betrayed everyone, and that was the one thing I couldn’t stand the thought of.
That’s why—
“Hello, everyone! We, Ryuseitai, have a very important announcement to make!”

(…!? W-What’s he doing all of a sudden!?)

(He’s not going to tell our fans that this is the last time the five of us will perform together… is he?)
(This is an extremely sensitive issue, so we decided that we’d announce it much more properly and carefully rather than in this improvised live show—)
(Isn’t that why we chose to make today all about making everyone enjoy themselves…?)
(Actually, wait—Midori-kun tends to not check HoldHands that often, so perhaps he isn’t aware of our decision…?)

Chapter 4

(Mmm… I don’t think Midori-kun’s planning on exposing everything to the public out of desperation or something.)
(He’s a hero too, after all—He said it himself, and we see him the same way no matter what.)
(He wouldn’t say something upsetting while he’s wearing his hero uniform.)
(Wait, no… He does actually say rude stuff to some people, like Morisawa-senpai. What’s that all about anyway? Is he trying to act like a spoiled kid around him—or maybe they’re messing around with each other? I mean, it sounds like it’s how he expresses his love, so…?)

“We’re—”
“No, wait… Umm… Sorry, I’m not good at talking…”
“Um, you may already know this, but—Morisawa-senpai is going to appear in the tokusatsu show that’s broadcasting next spring.”
“I’m sure you’ve heard of it, since there was an official announcement about his casting just the other day. The five core members of Ryuseitai you&#39;re seeing on stage right now will also be appearing in that show too.”

…? Uh, what’s this about? I didn’t hear anything about this.

Yeah, you wouldn’t have… ‘Cause we just decided on it a minute ago. In fact, Anzu-san is still negotiating with the agency about it as we speak—It’s not even official yet.

A-Are you sure it’s alright to announce something that hasn’t been finalized?

Yeah, probably… I’m sure she won’t have any problems negotiating with them. Besides, by announcing it here first, we’ll get the fans to talk about it, so the agency will find it hard to reject the decision…
That’s the kind of sneaky strategy I’m going for here… He he he~♪

hmm, i see. but you don’t have to copy after chiaki when it comes to that.

Huh!? Was I ever the type to do that sort of sneaky stuff!?

Yeah, I learned this trick from you, Senpai. I’ve grown up enough to understand what you’ve actually been doing for us all along.
“…They haven’t decided on what we’re going to play as yet, but—”
“We’ll likely be performing as new characters from a manga that’s never had a live adaptation before.”
“There will be an official announcement from the agency later, so… Please look forward to it, and please show us your support.”
“We’ll do our absolute best for the show—As Ryuseitai, and as the heroes of justice that everyone loves and admires.”
“We’ll make sure to meet your expectations, and make you smile the moment you see us on screen.”
“—That’s all I had to say. I’m sorry for the sudden announcement. Now, please enjoy our live show.”

…Um. I’m not really sure what to say here, but…
Please don’t just decide all of our plans on your own.
Of course, I’m very happy and honored to be able to take part in a tokusatsu show as a Ryuseitai member, but still…

We’ve got the free time, so it should be fine. We’re on a hiatus and all…
I’m sorry for doing it without your approval first, but you’re all used to that ‘cause of Morisawa-senpai anyway…
I mean, the guy used to constantly make us do hero shows out of nowhere, right?

…That’s true.
You’ve perfectly re-enacted my way of doing things, huh? You must’ve observed my lifestyle very carefully, and did your best to understand me.
That is, without a doubt, love. Thank you, I love you too.

I’m gonna kick you off the stage.
… Well, I do feel bad for deciding so much on my own, though.
But you guys did the same. You got this stage up and ready without even getting my approval first.
All while telling me it’s meant to be the final stage as the five of us together, or whatever.

But we did try to get your approval—you simply refused to be contacted in the first place, no matter how many times we tried…

Yeah, I’m sorry about that. But I wasn’t gonna approve of this even if I did pick up your calls.
I just can’t stand the thought of this being our last time together.

………

Besides… We haven’t even done anything wrong, so why’re we being forced into this horrible situation…?
I just don’t get it! I’m not satisfied, I can’t accept it as it is.
That’s why I refuse to accept it. You got a problem with that? Why’re you all so willing to be obedient, anyway?

Erm, I don’t really have an answer to that…

It’s ‘cuz we’re the heroes of justice. It’s not in our blood to come up with schemes to deceive and betray people while we snicker at them from above.
No matter how painful or horrible the situation is, we have to keep on smiling—

And we just have to take it? Just us? Why?

Um, I can’t really answer that, y’know?

…I just can’t accept this as it is. I think it’s ‘cause I’m not a full-fledged hero yet. Not that I even like heroes in the first place…
That’s exactly why I don’t get it. It’s like I’m looking at some kind of foreign culture. All the tokusatsu fans, Tetora-kun, Morisawa-senpai… You’re all so caught up with this culture for some reason—
You guys have such a weird fixation on pointless stuff like who gets to wear the red uniform, but… I think we should all wear what we wanna wear, including our favorite color.

Well, I suppose you do make a good point. But in hero sentai shows, red is a special color—The leader of the team, who is also the protagonist, is the one who’s meant to wear it.

I don’t care… I don’t have any interest in that stuff, so I just don’t get it—Who the hell decided on that rule?
Is it illegal to go against that rule? Are you gonna be fined or punished or something?
I hate how a convention that nobody even knows the origins of is souring you and Tetora-kun’s relationship…
That weird tradition can go eat shit.
We aren’t like Trickstar, who break down traditions to cause a revolution…
But we’re not basing ourselves on tradition like Akatsuki either.
Isn’t there something much more important to protect than some stupid tradition?
Because all of you have been acting like good kids, and holding yourselves back from saying anything, I&#39;ll be the one to say this, as the pampered second son of a greengrocer:
I literally couldn’t care less about tradition. All the staples, etiquette, conventions, and whatever nerdy stuff that goes with it, couldn’t matter any less to me. I honestly think it’s the dumbest thing in the world.
You’re all way, way more important to me than that.

………

I accidentally joined the idol course, and kept on hanging my head and whining about how depressing everything was, but you guys gave me a warm place to be part of.
You guys let me spend a whole year of fun and joy with you—That’s why all of you mean so much more to me.
I’m an awkward dunce without any experience in anything, but that’s exactly why I refuse to let go of the one thing that means the world to me.
Because I’ll never, ever have something like this ever again in my whole life—
Maybe it’s something trivial and disposable to you guys, but…
To me, you are all precious treasures that I never, ever once expected to have in my life.

Chapter 5

…I ended up preaching a bit. That&#39;s embarrassing… I don’t wanna keep our guests waiting, so let’s get rid of all the unnecessary stuff and start the show.
Ryuseitai’s show, made just for us.

Yeah, to be honest, one of the things we should never do as idols is chat amongst ourselves onstage. That’s known to be a tradition in Yumenosaki, but—
“Tradition can go eat shit,” huh…
On our way here, Takamine and I had a similar conversation.
It was a little awkward because he kept throwing a tantrum, but one of the wonderful things about him is that he doesn’t put up a strong front like I do.
He’s honest with himself, and so genuinely dazzling. He spoke out the feelings I was trying my best to hide deep inside me—the same feelings you guys likely had, too.
While we were on the verge of losing hope from the crushing reality, he found our true feelings for us.
Then he did his best to extend his hand as far as he physically could to try and save our hearts—as a hero.
Nagumo.

Ah! Yes, ossu! What’s up!? I’m honestly not keeping up with this conversation super well!

Yeah, that’s understandable. But, slow as it may be, you’ve been steadily moving forward one step at a time.
That’s exactly why I want to ask this one favor from you: Until the day comes when you’re satisfied with yourself and feel capable of wearing the red color, I’d like you to return the color back to me.

………

I want you to allow me to be Ryusei Red.
It’s always been my dream to don the red color. I’ve worked hard all this time to make that dream come true.
I struggled so much to reach the point I could become worthy enough to wear it—and the moment I was, I graduated from Yumenosaki.
And naturally, I followed the conventions of Ryuseitai—or rather, hero sentai shows—and passed down the color and leadership onto my junior.
By that, I mean you, Nagumo. I did it precisely because I believed you were suitable for the color.

…But reality was different from that, yeah? I failed to meet your expectations… I kept making us lose all the things you seniors worked hard to build up…

No, that’s not true. You’re not one bit at fault here.
I’m the one who made a mistake—our environment was rapidly changing due to the establishment of ES, yet I was still stubborn enough to try and stick to tradition without any prior thought.
The tradition of red inheritance doesn’t even have that long of a history. It actually started from my year.
Thinking about it, it really was just me wishing for a tradition like that in our unit, and decided to do all on my own.
I kept chasing after a dream instead of facing reality, pulling all of you along with me, only to hurt all of you for no reason.
I was the idiot here.
I wanted to act like a hero, but in the end, it was nothing different from a foolish parent trying to make their kids follow along with their own dreams.
In reality, as Takamine said, we could just wear outfits of the color we like—a color that suits who we are. And there’s nobody else in this world who’s wanted to wear the red color more than I have, ever since childhood.
That’s why from here on out, I’ll keep wearing the red color.

Then what about—…

You’re also free to wear the red color if you want to. And of course, you’re free to stay as black, too. You should wear the color you like.
What’s important here isn’t the color of our clothes—It’s if you guys feel satisfied with yourselves enough to wear the color.

………

—Kanata and I were genuinely planning to leave Ryuseitai, because we felt like we were getting in your way.
After all, you can’t avoid the two Ryuseitai units’ respective red colors being compared to each other.
Also, while I know this is out of line to say—I’ve worked for a much, much longer time than you guys in order to become someone worthy enough to wear the red color.
That’s exactly why at the moment, I’m the one people see as the more suitable member for the color. Which is only natural; we’re talking about differences in experience here.
You’re an incredible idol, but people thought you were inferior because they compared the two of us.
That frustrated me. That was why we tried to leave Ryuseitai. If there were one less Red, then there would be nobody to compare the other Red to.
That was the original plan. Ryuseitai, after all, is a unit that resides in Yumenosaki Academy.
It’s a group only meant to be within school, that can only be enjoyed through your highschool life, and that you can only be part of while you’re still a kid.
The members that graduate from school will, by default, retire from Ryuseitai. That was the tradition.
My predecessor and the guy before him were all like that—In fact, everyone who was Red aren’t even idols anymore, except for me.
I tried to abide by that tradition without prior thought.
But there’s no way anyone outside of our school would know about our unit’s tradition.
There are still so many people out there who think I’m the leader of Ryuseitai.
That’s why it’s jarring to them to see me in a different color from red, and you in it instead.
It’s only natural for people to feel that way.
People who aren’t into hero sentai wouldn’t know its conventions, and we never did an inheritance ceremony like Knights did.
We just passed things on to you guys without explaining anything to them—Of course they’d be confused.
It’s my fault for using my hectic schedule as an excuse to delay telling the public about our situation. I’m so sorry.

Oh, we did try to explain it to our fans multiple times. But it seems like they didn’t quite grasp what was going on…
Instead, we tried to explain why we’ve got two Reds around in different words, like calling the units by Ryuseitai-M and Ryuseitai-N—
But in the end, that just made things even more confusing.

Yeah, that’s why we should’ve retired from Ryuseitai much, much earlier.
But instead, I tried to be there for the fans who still wanted to see me as Ryusei Red, in what they call the “good-old Ryuseitai”.
I acted like a good kid to everyone, just because I didn’t want to see anyone sad, or fail to meet their expectations—
In the end, that led us to continue on our unit work in an unnatural way, all due to my attempts to satisfy everyone.
Because of that, we just ended up causing a lot of confusion for everyone, and then we were attacked by Crazy:B at our most vulnerable moment and suffered the consequences.
But I’m going to put all of that to an end right here, right now.
Until I build Ryuseitai a strong enough foundation to survive any hardship, I’ll be leading the unit as Ryusei Red—just like I did last year.
We’ll continue our activities within ES, with all five of us—only the five of us—as Ryuseitai.

Only the five of us—

Yeah, the Ryuseitai-N newcomers will be split into smaller units like Gunseitai and perform their own activities, right?
That was the agency’s orders, after all.
We’ll let the subsidiaries of our unit handle the Yumenosaki side. Of course, we’ll still be helping them out as much as we can.
This does mean we’ll be letting go of all the boys who joined our unit out of admiration right in the middle of their school year, though.
Regardless, we also demanded a handful of things from the agency in exchange for our compliance with their orders.

Chapter 6

First, we asked the agency to allow us to take part in the upcoming tokusatsu show together this spring. That’s what Takamine just announced to everyone.
The show is very high-budget and has a high chance of becoming a huge hit, so it would be an advantage for us to take part in it.
By the way, the footage from this live show will be used as a reference point for determining which roles they’ll officially give us.
That’s why it was important that we show off our cool fighting skills against the Great Kaijuu.

Ahh, I was wondering what that strange act earlier was for… This isn’t anything new between us, but it makes things confusing when the explanation comes in so late.

Yeah, I’m so sorry for doing that everytime.
Nevertheless, I’m going to be performing as both a kaijuu and a hero. This way, there should be no problems regarding my face being hidden behind the costume.
It solves the agency’s problem as well, so our proposal must have sounded perfect to them.
Also, I asked the agency to promise us they won’t interfere so harshly with Ryuseitai and its subsidiaries.
On top of that, if we&#39;re caught in any sort of scandal, they’ll do what they must to defend and protect us.
At the very least this stops us from being treated as slaves and convenient chess pieces by the agency.
This way, we’ll be able to protect our autonomy and freely do things the way we want to.
We’re not soldiers like Alkaloid—We’re heroes who sacrifice ourselves only under our own sense of justice.
…It would be selfish of me to say all that without giving anything in return, however, so we also took down the proposal of Kanata and I leaving Ryuseitai.
The two of us will be working as part of Ryuseitai from now on, as well.

Ah! I’m so glad to hear that. While I could infer why you two suggested that—
It truly is saddening to part ways.

Yeah, it is. But since we’re graduates, the longer we stick around in the academy with our activities, the more we’d hinder the former Ryuseitai-N members’ hard work.
That’s exactly why we’ll be moving our base to ES. We were ordered to prioritize ES over Yumenosaki, anyway.
To put it harshly, the Ryuseitai that existed in Yumenosaki will be gone for good.
We’ll be closing the curtains on the history of Yumenosaki’s Ryuseitai—the oldest idol unit in the academy.
From here on out, we’ll start a new page in history, as a new idol unit in ES.
Getting through these procedures will be tough, and we’ll have to start thinking about what to do with the names of songs like “Yumenosaki Ryuseitai Song”, but—
Right now, the main issue is things getting muddier and muddier while our fans are getting more confused.
That’s why I’ll be taking responsibility for everything, and rebuild the entire unit from scratch.
We’ll start over and assemble everything all over again. What we want to protect isn’t a tradition—it’s our freedom, our happiness, and the smiles of ourselves and our fans.

Mhm, mhm, exactly… That’s what you should’ve done from the very beginning.

Uumyu… He already officially announced to the public that he’d be making me the next leader, so… He couldn’t just scrap that whole thing away.
Then ES suddenly came into existence right after that, and things got more complicated… That’s why our seniors’ graduation didn’t end up being seen as “a turning point”—
Which is why there’s a huge difference between how we see our unit and how the public did.
Our seniors were intending to split off as soon as they graduate, but in the public’s eyes, it didn’t really look like they put a stop to anything.

Yeah… And on top of the ES commotion, we had to work extremely hard just to get used to the new jobs that we applied for…
We kept missing our opportunities to explain our situation, and that’s how we came to this point.
That’s exactly why, while it may be too late now, I would like to restart our pace with a proper grounded start.
None of this awkward fiddling anymore—I’ll guarantee us a foundation so strong that it won’t worry any of our fans.
Then, once I’ve made sure that everything’s alright in the unit, and once Nagumo has the confidence and strength to be satisfied with his role as the leader—
If you still have the will to be the next leader by then, I would like to do an official Red inheritance ceremony.

………

I don’t know how many years that would take—In the worst case scenario, it could never happen at all.
But I’ll still keep waiting and dreaming of the day that happens, and work hard to see it realized.
We—No, I rushed too much.
I was so fixated on getting things to move according to plan, and according to the ideal I was fantasizing about, that I couldn’t see reality properly.
I’ve brought many tragedies upon us because of that. I made you guys, and our fans, suffer so much.
But I’ll be ensuring I do things right this time, in order to compensate for what I’ve done.
I’ll surely be able to find the happy future where all of us are satisfied and agree together, and grasp it for us with my own two hands.
I swear that I will. I may be a lying paper-mache with nothing but a strong front, but I protect my vows. At the very least, I will do whatever it takes to protect it.

and i can vouch for that.
chiaki may be clumsy, and takes more steps back than forward while he’s struggling through his path—
and he may make many mistakes, but he always manages to properly do things by the end.

Yeah, I know. I mean, that’s what Ryuseitai’s all about, isn’t it?
I feel like I got to really be reminded of that all over again.
Us first years could barely do a single thing at first, but we still managed to work hard to grow strong.
We couldn’t do it properly at first ‘cuz we aren’t geniuses, but we managed to grow up so strong ‘cuz we never gave up, despite all our mistakes and the bumps and trips we experienced along the way.
But I forgot that for a moment—I took a step too far, thinking we’re already good enough by now—only to end up exposing a humiliating side of myself.
As a result, I ended up muddying the red outfit I had been given with so many expectations, and turned it pitch black.
But that’s the color I choose to wear as we start anew—
Until the day I become satisfied with myself enough to wear the red color.

Alright. I’m so sorry, Nagumo.

Why’re you apologizing? None of us did anything wrong, and we haven’t lost a single thing.
I mean, c’mon—There’s only one thing waiting out there for us: the dazzling future we’ll surely manage to reach by working hard.
You’re supposed to smile here, not apologize.

that’s right. we’re idols, after all.

Yup… Our fans are super open-minded so they kindly waited for us, but we would’ve gotten a lot of complaints by now if they weren’t…
I mean, we’ve just been talking among ourselves for forever…

Mhm, mhm. We’ll talk about this—no, about everything after our performance is over.
Our lives aren’t ending here, and the world isn’t ending either.

You’re right. Our graduation was meant to be our grand finale, but in the end, it was only just a checkpoint.
We were never supposed to stop there, but despite that, we never tried to take a step forward either and ended up running in place.
But it’s going to be different from here on. We’ll be walking step by step, towards the future we dreamed of reaching—
No matter what the future has in store for us, and even if we can only stay this way right now—we’ll be walking there together, as the five of us.

Chapter Index
Ch 5 - Ch 6 - Ch 7 - Ch 8 - Ch 9
Chapter 5
Location: Aoumi Aquarium (Main Exhibit)


Time: Another several minutes later…

(Ahhh, this is so depressing… I wanna die…)
(In the end, Tetora-kun and Shinobu-kun said they’re gonna take longer getting here…)
(And Shinkai-senpai went off somewhere ‘cause he suddenly had an urgent matter to deal with in the aquarium…)
(Thanks to that, now it looks like Morisawa-senpai and I are on an aquarium date for literally no reason besides us being alone together…)
(It feels like fate itself is trying to force me in his direction and I hate it… It feels so lonely with all of us separated from each other…)
(Ahh, I’m really starting to feel pissed off now…)

Look, Takamine! They’re selling plushies of some deep-sea creatures! I have no idea what they’re meant to be!
You love these kinds of soft looking creatures, right!? Alrighty then, your dad will buy it for you to commemorate us spending time together in the aquarium today!

You’re not my papa either, ‘kay?
(Actually, right now it does kinda feel like he’s a dad awkwardly trying to appease his daugh— his son in order to improve their strained relationship…)
(But it’s such a fitting scenario that I don’t wanna say it out loud…)
(Why’d things get this complicated between us, anyway…?)
(None of us even did anything wrong… We were just doing the best we could for the sake of justice and everyone.)
(It’s completely unreasonable, and it pisses me off… This is so depressing.)

Oh, look over here! This one looks exactly like you! So cute~!

Do you seriously not have any other way to compliment people…?
And for the record, being compared to some mysterious deep-sea creature doesn’t make me happy at all, ‘kay…?
But I could feel a little happy if you compared it to Shinkai-senpai[1] instead.

Oh, was that a pun!? Good one, Takamine! You win first prize…☆

Ugh, shut up… Man, it’s been a while since we’ve had a back-and-forth like this.

…Yeah, it really has been so long now. A new year started for us, and a lot happened within the unit and in my personal life…
But the reality of no longer having much of these lively moments hurts me the most out of everything that happened.
Why did it turn out this way between us…?

Ah, I was thinking something similar just now. It’s always so nice to share something in common, no matter what it is, huh? That feeling of joy gets cut in half whenever it’s with you, though.

Why did you have to add that!? Then who would you have preferred to be with right now instead?
Nagumo? Sengoku? Or maybe Kanata? Why’re you always so blunt towards just me!? Your dear ol’ grandpa feels so lonely!

Could you at least stick to one role…?

Alright… But, as pathetic as this may sound, I don’t even know what we are to you guys right now anymore.
I thought I could at least become a kaijuu like Mikejima-san for you three to defeat, so that justice would prevail…
But I can’t seem to manage it at all. It’s hard to be a kaijuu.

From what I saw when I was at the studio the other day, I think you managed to perform your kaijuu role pretty well.
Well, not that I know enough about them to be sure of that…

Oh, I appreciate you telling me that!
You’re really good at giving compliments! You’re always so harsh, so a compliment from you makes me extra happy, like I really did do a good job!

What’re you talking about…? Even I give honest compliments sometimes, y’know…?

Heheh, I do have a few things I want to improve on, though. Starting with what my director pointed out: I had an overwhelming presence for a kaijuu.

Ahhh~… Yeah, I always think that about you, too…

Yeah, I’m sorry for being so overbearing. It would be fine for me to perform that way if the kaijuu were the protagonist, but in a tokusatsu show, kaijuu are typically meant to be defeated by heroes.
You aren’t supposed to have such a strong presence on camera, nor make anyone think that you’re anything more than a kaijuu.
If the enemy acts human-like enough to make the audience empathize with them, they’ll feel sorry for them once it’s time for their defeat.
And that would corrupt the heroes’ form of justice.
That would’ve been fine to depict if the whole point was to show the despair of justice, or to make the audience empathize with the loser for a tear-jerking death scene…
However, that wasn’t the case, so you can say I botched my acting.
After all, I’m in a show that’s the same genre as the exciting and action-oriented Vampire Shogun, which also features simplistic moral lessons.

Ah, I heard of that show… But that’s as far as I know, ‘cause Shinobu-kun brought it up once…

Yeah! I love it, too! It was so unrestrained with how it did things. I would get so excited about what would happen next because you could never know what’s coming.
Although, that freedom is likely because of its enormous amount of sales, the power to manage its cast and resources at will — and most of all, the support from the fans.

Mmm? What do you mean by that…?

You see, there was a period of time when a group of overseas companies called the… something-Concern…? that invested their funds into Vampire Shogun to take control of it.
Their interference almost turned the show’s writing into a more pompous script. But due to the fans’ uproar, the show had a change of plans and went back to its former writing.
They were really close to bending it into a typical historical drama, but the fans didn’t consider Vampire Shogun to be that type of show.
Of course, had they restructured it into something interesting, this would’ve been a win for everyone.
But their take on the show ended up sounding more like an attempt to cater to the public without doing actual research on how to pull that off.

Hmm… Fan uproars are pretty scary, huh… We got flamed in the summer ourselves, so I can&#39;t say that it has nothing to do with me…

That’s true. But in the end, although the season that the overseas group invested in had a horrible reputation—
The video tapes of it are now being sold at premium prices for its unusual take on the show.

It sounds more like it just eventually became infamous for being bad, rather than getting re-evaluated for its writing…
But it doesn&#39;t really matter if the season became a rare commodity only after a decade or two passed…
I don’t care for stuff that has historical value or public appraisal. I don’t think it’s worth bothering with at all; what’s more important than that is—

(Phone starts ringing)

Mm?

Hm? What’s wrong? It’s rare to see you make such a grim face; did a monster invade the streets or something?

You watch way too much tokusatsu, Senpai.
(My phone’s been buzzing for a while now… Ohh, I see — I got a bunch of missed calls from Shinobu-kun and Tetora-kun…)
(What’s wrong…? I got angry at them for basically pushing the role of talking with our seniors on me, so I haven’t been checking HoldHands that much…)
(But there’s so many missed calls here… What’s going on…? There’s no way it’s something as serious as someone dying or an enemy invasion, so what gives…?)

Chapter 6

Yeah, yeah… What? Ahhh~ Okay, I’m sorry about that, but—

(Mm~… I have nothing to do while Takamine talks on the phone. Maybe I should check my work contacts on HoldHands while I have the time.)
(In the end, the showrunners I’m working with ended up arguing over and over about copyright issues and how to negotiate with the actors, which has put everything in a deadlock.)
(So the recording hasn’t made much progress, which gives me a lot of time to spare…)
(But not knowing where this is heading is making me uneasy.)
(No— That’s exactly why we have to make a decision by today.)
(I can’t just avoid thinking about these tiring topics by indulging myself in my comfort zone because I&#39;m too afraid of pain.)
(That was exactly the type of people I felt so frustrated with when I was a junior.)
(I just wanted to change our situation — our very existence, even if it was by pure force. Though… I was too much of a coward to do something as violent as that.)
(But… That’s exactly why this time around—)
(For the sake of the kids who turned me, a cowardly crybaby, into a hero—)
Takamine.

Ah, yes. I’m sorry, the call is over now.  …What’s with the serious face?

I’m always serious! And I seriously love you!

Die, please.  …I’m well aware how badly you wanna look cool — you’re just a liar as fake as paper-mache.
You don’t have to hide your true form from the people close to you, the same heroes as you — do you?
We’re not in some old tokusatsu show or American comic, so why do you keep hiding your true self?
What, is your family gonna be held hostage by an evil organization if people find out your true identity? Or are you gonna get arrested for being a vigilante or something?
I doubt you’ve done anything illegal in the first place, and we’ve grown strong enough to protect ourselves by now.

………

Could you quit pretending not to see us for ourselves already? It pisses me off…
You keep treating us like weaklings who need to be protected, just so you can remain as the hero.

T-That’s not what I—
I just don’t want my place of belonging — the dream I’ve finally achieved — to be smashed into pieces again.

“Again”? I dunno what you’re on about, but you really are looking down on us, aren’t you…?
Sure, we once resigned ourselves to just being pathetic, useless first years to you guys…
But Senpai, did you know?
As the leader of Ryuseitai-N, Tetora-kun did an amazing job protecting and raising ten times the amount of pathetic juniors than you have.
And it’s only been a few months since they joined in the spring, too. There’s so many of them, but they still grew twice as fast.

Yeah… Nagumo’s amazing, and that’s exactly why I chose him to be the next leader.
He’s a bit of a klutz, so he tends to be looked down on — but he’s relentless with his hard work, and knows how to turn all his experiences into his strengths.
That’s how he’s going to build himself thoroughly to grow into a splendid man.
He’ll eventually surpass Kiryu and I, and become an ideal figure that everyone admires, and save even more people than we have.
I’ve always dreamed of such a future for him.
…Even though I should’ve been well aware of how cruel reality truly is.

Well, I think Tetora-kun will keep pushing forward no matter what, and work as hard as he can.
So don’t just give up like that; please keep supporting him in every way you can — Senpai.

I’m aware. Our decision to leave Ryuseitai has to do with that, too. There are some things that are hard to do while wearing the mask of justice.

Huh, is that so… And here I thought you were working yourself to the bone ‘cause you wanted that “mask” so badly.

………

Chapter 7

Tetora-kun&#39;s not the only one… Shinobu-kun became part of the Student Council, and he&#39;s basically the advisor and mediator in Ryuseitai-N now, too.
He’s a master at collecting info and smoothing out issues between people. It feels like his hidden talents finally got a chance to bloom.
His true powers burst forth right when the going got tough. Sounds just like a hero, right?
I can’t speak for the Student Council, but Ryuseitai-N would&#39;ve tripped over its own feet and disintegrated way earlier if he wasn’t around.
And to add the cherry on top, he&#39;s even getting a lot of recognition as an individual, too.
He’s such a shy kid, but he still managed to establish a place for himself as a one-of-a-kind ninja idol.
He could easily become a total laughing stock if he messes up in his role, y’know…?
Despite all that, it still hasn’t stopped him from going down his own path. And we’re talking about someone who used to be as much of a scaredy cat as I am.
But just look at him now; he grew so much in a blink of an eye.
Thanks to the past year he spent with you two seniors, he got to stack up tons of experience and build so much courage in himself, and nothing bended his love for his interests no matter what he’s gone through.
Now he’s doing his best to give hopes and dreams to others with his tiny little hands, hoping that others can share the same interests as him.
I’m sure that’s what he’s wanted to do all along — So I refuse to let anything stop him from achieving his dreams, be it Crazy:B, Ryuseitai-N, or Ryuseitai-M.
But he’s a kind, big-hearted kid, though, so I’m sure he’d just laugh off his troubles as another experience to learn from.

…Yeah. That’s the kind of kid he is — He’s the strongest one out of all of us.
He’s our role model and our guide. He’s much more suited for that job than Kanata and I.

Please say all of that to him instead…
I’m the worst out of the flock, so I guess that’s why you kept supporting me the most, like during Repayment Festival—
But Shinobu-kun and Tetora-kun both probably went through a similar life to mine; I’m sure they barely got any praise from anyone in the past.
They’re in desperate need of validation and approval, y’know?
I’m the same as them — I was a “pathetic kid,” so I know that they must be feeling that way.

Oh, really…? But I was trying my best to hug, pat and praise them for every single thing they do.

You’re awful at it… Like, you do that to basically everyone in the same fashion, so it’s hard to tell if that’s real praise or not—
It always felt like you were just trying to praise us with something, anything, like giving candy to a kid, and it really ticked me off.

I see… This is quite difficult for me. I’m not that good at communicating with people, to be honest.
I was living a very lonely youth before I met you guys.
I was also a sickly child, and couldn’t play outside with other kids very often.

Hmmm… So that hot-blooded heroic stuff you do really was an act all along, huh… Well, I figured it was…
It felt so fake to see you act that way. Like, I’d keep thinking there’s no way a person like this actually exists in real life. You always acted as if a camera was recording you—

Yeah, it’s kind of embarrassing… But in that sense, it’s incredible how you can act so naturally all the time.

You say that like it’s a good thing… I just find acting a pain to do… There was nothing I wanted so badly that I’d go through the effort of doing that.
But things are different now. I have something I want — something I wanna get no matter what it takes.

Hm? What would that be? Could it be my love or something!?

You’d push that on me even if I said I didn&#39;t want it, wouldn’t you?

“ping pong ping pong~♪”
“hello~ announcement, we have an announcement~♪”

Hm? Is that Kanata?

It sure is… He was called over by a couple staff members for some business in the aquarium just now — I wonder what happened…?

“mm~m~ ahem, ahem~♪”
“hello, everyone~ thank you for visiting the aoumi aquarium today!”
“as you may know, i’m the mascot[2] known as kanatee~♪”
“you’re not feeling blue today, are you? despite my color, i’m not feeling blue at all~ i wonder if it’s because of all the fishies? kana-kana~♪”

…I don’t really know much about Kanatee… What sort of character is it meant to be?

Mmm~… It was basically just Shinkai-senpai at first, but…
He wanted to make it go viral, so after brainstorming a bunch of ideas, it kinda turned into this cringey mess…

Huh, I see. I think it’s cute, though.

I think so, too. We agree for once, huh, Senpai?
If you just had Shinkai-senpai&#39;s voice to go off of, you might forget that he’s actually a pretty big guy who packs a punch.

A big guy, huh? That’s true, but his most extraordinary trait is his ability to downplay his formidable appearance so that no one&#39;s afraid of him.
I’d say he&#39;s like the exact opposite of a kaijuu.

Well, that’s ‘cause there’s no way anyone would be scared of the ocean, unless there was a raging storm going on.

“owaaaaaaaaaaaah!?”


Wha—!? W-What’s happening? That was a scream just now… right?

“oh nooo! aoumi aquarium has been accused of kidnapping and abducting marine animals to make money—”
“by none other than the ruler of the ocean — the great kaijuu! and he’s come to strike us down!”

Huh? What’s he talking about…?

Dunno…
Ah, no wait— I get it now.

What’s this all about?

As always, you’re so bad at figuring things out. Lemme put it in other words—

“someone please save us! this is a predicament we’ve never seen before!”
“if the great kaijuu continues to cause any more destruction, aoumi aquarium will be doomed to perish!”
“so! um, are there any heroes in the aquarium today!? someone who will protect us all!?”


—It&#39;s kinda messy, but… To put it simply, it’s our turn to shine, Senpai.

Chapter 8
Location: Comet Show Stage


Time: At the same time, on the stage within the aquarium

—Aight! We managed to finish setting up everything for the live show. I’m amazed we got everything decently sorted out on such short notice.

It’s all thanks to Anzu-dono’s cooperation! She’s excellent at stage preparation for concerts that happen on the spur of the moment.
Everyone from Ryuseitai-N also came over to assist us the best they can, saying that they wanted to help give them a final farewell.

I’m really grateful to everyone. We’re named after the shooting stars who grant people’s wishes, but we keep having our wishes granted by others instead.

You should think in the reverse, Tetora-kun!
We poured all our efforts into granting people’s wishes — and for that, they’re helping us achieve ours.
All we should do now is be grateful for such a token of kindness.

Ossu, you got it. All for one, one for all—
Were we able to become the Ryuseitai our seniors hoped for in the nick of time…?


heeey, you twooo~♪ i’ve made the public announcement as you told me to. was it good enough?

Yup! We could hear it from over here too. I’m real sorry we made you do errands for us, Senpai.

no need to apologize. this is my aquarium after all, and i can’t let someone else make the announcement without my permission~ it only makes sense that i’m the one who does it, right?
i changed it up a bit to sound a little more like something i’d say…. was it alright, shinobu?

Why, of course it was! The script I gave you was simply for reference!
Your voice is so calming to hear, I couldn’t help but feel wrapped in comfort and awe! My, I wish we had asked you for help in the broadcast committee back when you were still in school~♪

you are going too far with those praises~ i am often scolded for being hard to understand, you know?

Heheh, that’s true. Sometimes I find myself spacing out when you’re talking, and I have to reaaally focus to actually get what you’re saying.

Mhm, mhm! Surprisingly, you tend to speak in a slightly incomprehensible manner, Shinkai-dono.

ehe! that is because i was once a god~♪
the more complicated words you speak, and the more convoluted they are, the more you sound like you’re saying something incredible~
people will try their best to over-interpret what i am saying, you see?

Mm… I dunno what you’re on about, but that’s another reason why I think you and Morisawa-senpai make a good combination.
‘Cuz on the other hand, Morisawa-senpai always talks about things in a super simple and clear way.

fufu. though that comes with him being very argumentative~ much, much more than i could be.
that’s exactly why it’s so hard to win an argument against him. once he’s set his mind on something, he’ll refuse to budge.

I don’t plan on arguing with him, so it’s fine. I don’t get anything outta doing that, anyway…
I think there was a time when heroes fighting among each other was a whole thing in movies and stuff, but I don’t really like that kind of stuff.
Maybe my mindset is just old-fashioned and unrealistic, though…
But I dunno, I just love the good ol’-fashioned shows with simplistic moral lessons, the kinds where the heroes all band together and fight evil in the most cliche way ever.
What’s right is right, and what’s wrong is wrong, and that’s exactly why justice will always prevail against evil. And the reason for that is ‘cuz everyone hopes to live their life in the most righteous way possible.
Our society is moved by people’s emotions, so justice will always be stronger than evil.
If everyone does their best to live with a proper mindset and achieve their own success—
Then someday, those victories will pile up enough to eradicate evil from this world. That’s how we can achieve world peace.
But I know this is such an idealistic view of things that not even the most child-friendly tokusatsu shows depict it anymore.

—is that what justice is to you?

I’m still thinkin’ on it. I’m only a greenhorn, so I’m still inexperienced and all.
I’m in no position where I have to rush myself to figure things out and get to work.
‘Course, I am aware that we can’t just stand around and do nothing right now, either…
But I know how I am — I just panic and mess up the moment I rush myself. I’m painfully aware of that part of me by now.
So I’ll just steadily work hard to the best of my ability ‘til the day I become strong enough to grasp my own justice — my own correct answer, within my own two hands.
I’ll keep doing that, even after you two leave Ryuseitai.


Ah, about that… I believe that our seniors are possibly—

—oh! anzu-san sent me a message. chiaki and midori should be here soon.

Ahaha, I feel regretful for making Anzu-dono work on our behalf on her day off.

That’s why we’ve gotta make sure to entertain everyone and leave ‘em with fun memories. I’m gonna work hard to accomplish that, ossu!

yes. for this is our final stage as the five of us together—
so let’s carry out our performance with a smile on our faces. this may be where it all comes to an end, but we’ll make sure that everyone thinks of it as a happy ending.

Chapter 9
Location: Aoumi Aquarium (Main Exhibit)


—So in other words…
The other three plan to make a final parting memory with the five of us all together as Ryuseitai?
And that’s why they asked for help from Anzu and your juniors in Yumenosaki with setting up the stage?

Yeah, I guess… I haven’t been touching HoldHands up until now, but that sounds like what they were telling me in their messages.
Tetora-kun even sent me a message that said, “let’s do our best together! (^_^)v”, but it just sounds like he’s trying so hard to keep a positive attitude that it hurts to see… I should’ve never checked my phone, this is so depressing…

Hmm… So that’s why they were so late for our meet up in the aquarium, huh?
They were running around making negotiations with various people, and getting the word out for the live show — all while preparing the materials and tools needed for the stage.
It all makes sense now! I feel a weight off my back with that mystery solved.

What is there to even feel relieved over…? Seriously, what the hell is “final parting memory” even supposed to mean…?
Wasn’t Repayment Festival enough for that?

Maybe this means that the festival wasn’t enough for them.
We weren’t the only ones performing in Repayment Festival, after all.
They probably wanted to have a final performance that was just the five of us as Ryuseitai.

It feels like a funeral, though… I know I’m not one to talk, but it genuinely sounds so depressing and miserable to me…
Actually, doesn’t this mean that they gave up trying to fight back, and decided to accept the reality of our situation?
They’re planning to follow the agency’s orders, and split up Ryuseitai once and for all—
And this final live show feels like something to “commemorate the parting of our unit”.
I thought they were busy figuring out a way to get us out of this mess, but all along they already accepted their fate and were just thinking of how to call it quits…

Yeah… Though putting it that way makes them sound bad.
Nagumo is still the leader of a large group of members right now.
He wouldn’t choose to be selfish and throw the whole unit into danger by going against the agency.
He’s an honest, good kid, after all. And so is Sengoku.
Their good-hearted nature is exactly why they tried their best to search for a future where everyone in the unit is happy — and that includes us graduates.
I think it’s admirable of them. And I choose to respect their decision.

Okay, but that doesn’t change the fact that it just means we basically lost the battle… I can’t properly express myself, but it just frustrates me somehow.

You see, that’s where Nagumo decided to be mature and hold back his frustration. He really didn’t have to take after me when it comes to those things, though.

It’s more like he’s always been that kinda guy.
He’s apparently been raised with an athlete&#39;s kind of lifestyle, so I bet it stresses him out a lot to disobey his superiors.
Not to mention, he’s been in pretty low spirits during his time working with Ryuseitai-N. It’s not that he’s lost all heart—
But comparing our current era to last year, when you seniors were around, makes him so disappointed in himself.
He’s also suffering from that bitter time when we got torn to shreds for taking the challenge against Crazy:B[5] without thinking it through.
On top of that, we had a whole bunch of newbies back in spring, but they kept dropping out one after the other… ‘Cause they kept thinking the unit’s different from what they expected.

…………

We don’t have as many drop-outs now, and the ones we have left are the sorta motivated, good-hearted kids who wanna keep following after Tetora-kun.
And after all that effort, we now even have to cut ties with those good kids too just ‘cause of the agency’s orders—
And to make matters even worse, you guys declared a leave from Ryuseitai.

…………

Tetora-kun must feel so pathetic and frustrated with himself.
He’s questioning if he’s ever actually been suited to be a leader in the first place — And when you lay out all that he’s done so far as one, it’s only natural he’d start doubting himself.

Nagumo worked as hard as he could, didn’t he?

The only people who’d give you a gold star just for working hard are primary school teachers and you guys.
The public is much more fair and a lot more strict. I mean, even ES is a corporation with the goal to make profit at the end of the day. You gotta show real results or you’re fired.

I…
I never, ever thought things would turn out this way. I didn’t give it enough thought, and ended up making you all suffer unnecessarily.

Yeah, just like a kaijuu would.
But it’s not your fault, really… No one ever imagined that something as bizarre as ES was gonna emerge from the ground until after our school year was completely over.
It’s like a natural disaster — nobody could’ve predicted it. No one’s at fault here.

That’s true… Tenshouin made ES — a paradise for idols — in order to achieve his dreams. I&#39;m sure he didn’t do it to hurt anyone.
But unfortunately, if a humongous object like ES were to move even a small step, there would inevitably be casualties along the way.
So that’s how it works… I suppose I could now perfect my kaijuu act with this realization.

I don’t think that role suits you, though.
—You’re much more suited to be this, aren’t you?

Hmm, so… the outfits Anzu handed to us earlier were for the live show?
Wow, she managed to stitch them up in such a short amount of time. I feel like she’s becoming superhuman at this point.

Everyone’s been getting better and stronger, you’ve just been pretending not to see it.
…But there’s apparently an actual reason why she managed to finish these so quickly.

What do you mean by that?

Dunno… She barely talks, even on HoldHands, so…
Anyway, I think we should change now before we head over to the live show.
Judging from the announcement earlier, they’re likely making the stage into a hero show—
It would ruin the vibe if we rushed in to save everyone in our regular civilian clothes.

That’s true! Alright, let’s get to it then.
Oh! How convenient! The toilet’s right in front of us!

Okay, feel free to change first.

Hm? We’re not changing together? We’d get the job done faster that way, though! C’mon, all the kiddos are waiting for our rescue!

I’m pretty sure the audience is confused about why there’s suddenly a performance happening, and for some reason, I can’t stomach the idea of being in a tight space with you…

You can’t stomach the idea!? Why do you say that, Takamine!? I’m not planning on doing anything strange! I promise!

Why do I get the feeling you’ll break your promise in an instant…?
Let’s not complicate this and just change after each other, ‘kay? We’ll be failures as heroes if we don’t make it on time for an important moment.

True… But am I really going as Red again? I’ve been telling all of you over and over again that Nagumo’s the current leader of Ryuseitai…

Mmm~… I think it’s only you tokusatsu fans who waste your time caring about that kind of thing…
Every last one of you are so insistent on making everything harder on yourselves with this pointless stuff — It’s all so dumb.

……?

The ES!! Main story is fully voiced in-game.

Chapter 123: Injured
(Rinne is currently live on stage, preparing himself to diss Ryuseitai on the Idol Royale.)

(Midori and Chiaki, in another area)


…Wha? Huh? Isn’t this like, really bad…?


What’s up, Takamine! Does your stomach hurt!? Exercise is the perfect medicine for the stomach! Let’s do hindu squats together! ☆


Shut up.  ……Please look at this for a moment, Morisawa-senpai.

Did you just casually tell me to shut up!? And with a low voice, too! Are you in your rebellious phase, Takamine~!? Is my love not reaching you!?

I was always acting “rebellious” towards you, though…
Nevermind that — Here. Look at this please; doesn’t this look really bad?

Hm… This is—horrible. It’ll be a fatal wound on us in the worst case.
We’ll have to contact the rest of Ryuseitai and group up, then we’ll need to quickly go to the Idol Royale hall.

Huh? Uhh… But is that okay for you? You’re seeing me off for some reason, but don’t you have loads of work to do for the rest of the day?

Yeah, but I’ve built a trustworthy relationship with the people I work with, and they aren’t the type who can’t understand personal circumstances.
I could ask them a favor to keep the photoshoot for tomorrow, so let’s hurry and head to the hall straight away.

Ah, no… You really should do your job like you’re meant to. I’ll go meet up with Tetora-kun and the others, and deal with the matter.
You’re still new into your career, aren’t you? You can’t just be reckless like that.
If you do the wrong move, all that effort you put into having those trustworthy relationships may go back to square one — Don’t act rash, please.
And anyway, don’t get too ahead of yourself please; nothing’ll change whether you were there or not.
Quit poking yourself into every single thing. Please have faith in us, and let us handle it.

Yeah… You’re right. You’ve grown so splendidly, Takamine. I’m so proud of you~

Do not pat my head.
…Alright, I gotta hurry, so I’ll be leaving now. I’ll keep you updated.

Got it. Be careful, Takamine — I have a bad feeling about this.
It’s been peaceful for a while, so honestly, I let my guard down… But it seems like something as ill-intentional as the revolution from two years ago has surged… But it might be even more serious than that.

Chapter 124: Emergency
Location: Training Room


Tetora-kuun~!
No wait— I mean Nagumo Tetora-Taichou! I, Ryusei Yellow — Sengoku Shinobu, have belatedly arrived at our lesson!
Here are some refreshments~ Please do accept them~♪

Ahaha, you don’t have to call me by “Taichou”, Shinobu-kun. It actually makes me feel more queasy — Like, I dunno, I kinda feel somethin’ weird &#39;bout it to this day.
‘Cuz like, Ryuseitai never had an actual inheritance event like Knights did with the Crowning Ceremony in Florence.

Uumyu~ I think we should be doing that, though.
Our seniors have been busy all over the place and can barely fit time in their schedule ever since their graduation neared, and now here we are…

Ooh, you copied my thing!

Ah— So you were saying “uumyu” on purpose, Tetora-kun?

Well, more like it became a topic among our fans, so I felt like I had to keep sayin’ it…
I get some extreme responses whenever I say “uumyu”, and that makes me happy, so…


That’s how I feel about the role of Taichou, too — I think I’ll be able to get used to being the leader once I become a great man who can match up to that title.
For now, I gotta work hard, then work harder, then even harder and harder! Ossu!

(Mm… But… I really feel like Tetora-kun has not been doing well lately. It’s like he’s trying his best to seem energetic.)
(He is the type to act like a tough guy, so he usually holds things in no matter how painful or rough it gets.)
(At the very least, Midori-kun and I need to pay close attention to that, as we are the ones closest to him.)
(Mhm, and Morisawa-dono and Shinkai-dono should have finally, at last, reached a breathing point in their lives.)
(We should plan out an event to hold a ceremony for the inheritance of Ryusei Red—as a surprise.)
(Ryuseitai does not have that sort of tradition or anything, so that might be why Morisawa-dono and the others forgot to do such a thing…)
(However, it is why there are all sorts of things said about us compared to Knights, so I think it is best that we do this for the sake of Ryuseitai’s future, too.)
(We are waiting for MDM at the moment, and it will cost a bit of our expenses, but…)
(We have decided not to participate in the so-called “Idol Royale”, so we should have enough funds for the live show.)

Hm? What’s wrong, Shinobu-kun? You’ve been in deep thought for a while now…
You’ve been having those moments a lot lately, y’know? Is somethin’ bothering you?

Hehe, I was sinking in the fact that we both became second years, and cannot continue to be children who blindly follow their seniors’ orders.
Plus, I am quite the busy person—I have joined the Student Council under Isara-dono’s invitation, and have much thinking to do about many matters.
Though frankly, I would like to also gather more new members so that I may advance the Ninja Association into a club…

Ah, then how about we do something ninja-related like Scroll of the Elements again?
Both me and Midori-kun’ll help out as much as we can, since we’re always in your debt — It’ll be our repayment to you~♪

Ahaha, our trail of thoughts are different, but we are still thinking about the same thing.
No matter how much our roles or members have changed, we will always be Ryuseitai.

Ossu! All for one, and one for all! That’s the true image of Ryuseitai, the Super Sentai Idols of Justice!


Bad news! We’ve got an emergency, everyone!

Eep!? W-W-What is happening, Midori-kun!? What’s made you rush in here like we’re in a historical drama…!?

Huh? Midori-kun, didn’t you have some fancy commercial shooting to do at the TV station?
You were happy about possibly meeting Morisawa-senpai, since he’s doin’ a drama shoot in the same place, weren’t you?

I was not!
We were just talking on HoldHands and that idiot was all giddy like, “then I’ll come see you, Takamine! ☆”, and then had to go and find a way to come over and greet me!

Ahh, so you did get to see him. Good, good, was he doing well?

Ahaha. Rather, I could never imagine him not doing well.

Yeah, yeah, he was! I wasn’t worried about that, really, there’s more pressing matters right now…!

Alright, alright, calm down. You’re always so low in energy, so this isn’t like you — What happened? Did something bad happen during your shooting?

No, it’s not that… Ahh, jeez! Just look at this video!
Crazy:B’s starting to say some crazy stuff on that Idol Royale thing!

Idol Royale… If I remember clearly, Morisawa-dono was asked to have Ryuseitai appear on that stage.
However, as always, Morisawa-dono and Shinkai-dono are far too busy to have their schedules match up, and you also had your commercial shooting to do today…
I also personally had student council duties to deal with first.
Not to mention, as students, we have not yet been able to do proper unit activities within Ryuseitai-N, as most of our members are newcomers… So we chose to decline the offer, did we not?

Ossu, we did. Crazy:B’s got a lotta bad rumors going &#39;round, after all.
Morisawa-senpai also mentioned that it felt awkward to decline, since we were personally requested to appear on stage, but that it felt wiser to refuse the offer.

Mhm. The current Ryuseitai leader is Tetora-kun, so Morisawa-dono felt like it was wrong to decline it on his own and contacted you about the matter.
Morisawa-dono was only the middleman, but he still went ahead and properly explained why we chose to decline the offer to the client.
So, yes, Ryuseitai no longer has any relation with the Idol Royale—

Yeah… That was how it was meant to be. See, I was kinda curious about Crazy:B, ‘cause Akehoshi-senpai would sometimes mention them during club activities in school.
‘Cause like, he’d always look upset talking about them, which is unusual for him… So I thought hey, if he hates it, then maybe I’ll like it—

Ahaha, he’s a grand idol who won the SS, you know? You should make sure to get along with him, Midori-kun.
You will be able to gain quite a lot from doing so; you should learn from Isara-dono and I, as I have pledged a vow to be a servant to my lord~♪

No way… I can’t physically deal with that guy… Trickstar must be having a lot of free time lately or something, because he keeps pestering me…
Just when I thought I’d have a peaceful time at school now that Morisawa-senpai’s graduated…
No, wait— Forget about Akehoshi-senpai, we need to talk about Crazy:B—
Right now, at the Idol Royale… They’re literally bashing Ryuseitai, calling us frauds and hypocrites.

Chapter end. Next chapter, Rinne starts bashing on Ryuseitai, and fabricating screenshots of things they’ve “said”. The summary of it is to make Ryuseitai sound like fake heroes who only do things for profit.

——Ryuseitai!

Don’t set out to battle just yet!

Hm? Hidaka? Akehoshi? What’s up, what’s wrong?
I thought you guys at Trickstar became much more quiet this year. Are you actually planning to cause a stir on this final stage…?

Spare us from any unnecessary disruptions, ‘kay?

We wouldn’t do that! How rude! Hrmph, hrmph!

It’s as Akehoshi says. We’re extremely grateful to Morisawa-senpai — No, to Ryuseitai as a whole, for what you’ve all done for us during the first DDD.
We will never forget what you did for us. We assure you that we won’t do anything to repay that kindness with spite instead.

So you say, but all you did in Tanabata last year was put pressure on us… My depression got worse for a while after that, y’know…

Ahaha, but thanks to everything that had happened then, we were able to finally peel off our newbie labels. All’s well that ends well!

Well, I’m sure it was nice for you since you were just flirting with Isara-senpai, Shinobu-kun… but it was a traumatic experience for me, personally…

Huh? Why? Did we do something to you, Takamin?

You see what I mean…? Could you guys please understand your position for once…?

We’re told that often. Especially lately.

erm. did you have something to [tell] us, trickstar?

Fuhaha! You came to cheer for us as fellow members of the Red Team, right? I’m sure that’s why!
Thank you! We’ll turn your cheers into strength, and march forth!

Chi~chan-senpai…
(I really can’t say it after all… He won’t listen even if I tried… After all, I got that from him in the end.)
No, never mind. Mhm, I just came to cheer for you guys. Do your best out there!

Um, we don’t need you to tell us that, ‘kay? We’re gonna do our best no matter what. Does everyone seriously just see us as weaklings or something?

Ohhh, Midori-kun suddenly became so energetic!

He’s got a stronger fighting spirit than you’d first expect, after all~! ♪

…Yeah. If Ryuseitai wins here, we’ll have won four battles in a row, and it would let us Red Team win in the end.
Knowing the victor half-way into the event would ruin the fun for everything, but—
At least it would mean that once we’re up next, we can perform as we like, without worrying about victories and losses.

Mhm! We prefer it that way, anyway, so make sure you win, Ryuseitai! ♪ We’re all pretty tired of all this fighting and crushing each other, anyway!

Ahaha, that’s so not like you guys.

What do you mean?

Wh— Why do you look so surprised…? Maybe you aren’t like that this year, but you guys were basically picking a fight with anyone last year, like you were some biker gang…

Biker gang… I suppose that is a perfectly fitting phrase for us.

Ohh, incredible Takamin! You’re so precise! So smart! There, there, there~♪

Don’t get near me! I don’t want your pestering! Can you just go already if you’re done talking…!?

But Takamin, you love being pat like this, right? ♪

I’d never be happy being pat by you!

fufu, exactly~ i will not say that your help is [unnecessary], but…
there is no [need] to worry about us. we will not lose anymore.
we will win this [battle], and ensure [victory] for the [red team], all so that we may [relieve] those who will [perform] after us.
don’t you think that is very ryuseitai of us?

Exactly what Kanata said! Believe in us and watch over us, Trickstar! We won’t lose to anyone any further!

I see. Then we’ll believe in you all.
That’s good enough, right, Akehoshi?

Mhm. If anything, I’m sorry we ruined your focus just before your performance.

You really did… What an absolute nuisance.

Now, now… They aren’t the type to act on ill intent, so let’s laugh it off and forgive ‘em.

laugh and forgive! that is also very ryuseitai-like~♪

Ahaha~ True, that’s what I love about you guys.
You always give me energy and courage.  …Good luck out there, I mean it!
♪~♪~♪

Right, we’ll excuse ourselves now. Sorry for the trouble.
We wish you the best of luck from the bottom of our hearts.

    Season: Summer


    Location: Shopping District


Fuhahahaha! ☆ It really feels nice to have a morning walk!
It’s a shame we stopped hearing the cicadas the moment it got cooler, but summer will come about again! For now, let’s enjoy the coming autumn season!

there are many things we can do in [autumn] — other than it being a word in chiaki’s name[1], it is also a season for [art], [sports] and [appetite]…♪
i hope we get to enjoy it with the [kids].

Yeah! We’re all too busy, so our schedules don’t match up very often, but — I’d really like to enjoy the autumn season with the five of us together.
…Oh! Oops, we were about to skip past it. Kanata, it’s over here!

here… ahh, so is [that] what you were looking for?

Yup, this capsule vending machine!
One of my favorite hero series released a capsule toy, but the machine was always sold out whenever I came to get one.
I heard they restock early in the morning, so I came as soon as possible.
Hehe, and right that was. There are so many capsules inside~♪
I prepared a lot of coins for this moment. I should be able to get the hero with this many—☆
I’ll make sure to come out victorious! Time for my first attempt! Oooooh…!!


    Five minutes later…

…Guh! I can’t believe I didn’t get a single hero after all those attempts…! Is this the villain’s doing!?
I should’ve brought my wallet… The hero I seek for is still dwelling within the vending machine…!

that’s too bad… and you were even able to [get] all the [villains], too.

Yeah… But I shouldn’t mope over this. This only means it’ll be even more exciting the next time I try.
Also, now that I’ve caught so many monster villains, there should be a higher chance for kids to get the hero.
After all, they can’t use as much money as an adult on these machines. I’m glad I could help them from the shadows…☆
Anyhow, that was my task for today. As promised, I’ll now accompany you however you like!


    Location: Beach


It’s a bit warmer here. We should be able to avoid catching a cold with this temperature.
I’ll make a secret base over here. You’re free to puka puka as much as you like~♪

[secret base]? are you going to make a big [sand hill]?

Oh no, it’s going to be for these villain toy figurines. I used to make secret bases in the park’s sandbox when I was young.
But back then I’d make them for heroes, not villains. Anyway, it’s alright to play around like a kid every once in a while, don’t you think?

yes. the [kids] are not here so you do not have to act like an adult.
please enjoy yourself freely, however you wish to. i will also stay here, and puka puka.

Alright! Call for me if you ever feel like the waves are about to sweep you away. I’ll come rushing to you immediately!

i’m fine. the [waves] are very calm today.
…oh?

I hear people chattering… Hmm, it seems like some primary school kids are playing hero pretend.
But something seems off…?
(Hm… It sounds like they’re arguing over who’ll have to play as the villain. They’re trying to push the role on the timid-looking boy…)
We can’t let this slide. Let’s go, Kanata!

okay~♪


    Time passes…

Fuhaha! I see you’re all full of energy and enjoying yourselves!
…That’s right — I’m Morisawa Chiaki from Ryuseitai, and this here is Shinkai Kanata! I’m so happy to hear you know who we are!
You see, we also love playing hero pretend. Could you let us join you? Oh yes, I don’t mind playing as the villain! ☆

then i will play the [hero].
[dark chiaki]! i’ll defeat you without fail and protect the peace of the city!
take this, [ryuseitai beam]! pew pew pew!


Bwahahaha! You barely even scratched me! What could you ever do on your own!?

why you~, what a tough [villain]. i won’t be able to defeat him by myself. everyone, let’s combine our powers!
ready~, set— pew pew pew pew pew!

GAAAAAAAAAH!? N-No, how could this be—! (collapses)

we did it. we achieved this [result] because we cooperated together, peace~☆

Hehe, it’s not so bad to play as the villain every once in a while. I’m happy you all enjoyed it!
Now then, it’s quite clear to me that you all love to be heroes. But that doesn’t mean you should force someone else to be the villain, does it?
Could someone who forces others to do what they don’t want to do truly become a hero?
The real evil isn’t playing as the monster villain role — it’s when you hold a selfish, wicked heart.
Listen up, kids! I want all of you to grow and become kind, splendid heroes who save the weak!
Oh? You’d like to try playing as the villain? Why, of course you can! You can be Dark Chiaki No.2! ☆
Mhm, looks like our job here is done. Farewell, everyone! May we meet again!

ufufu. with this, we were able to protect the [peace], right, chiaki?

Yeah! Hero shows always end with a happy ending of everyone smiling! Fuhahaha! ☆

    Season: Summer


    Location: Training Room


(Here we are at the training room! I&#39;mma get back to the usual workout grind~!)
(Mm, someone&#39;s here before me? I see him right by the workout machines…)
Hello, Sazanami-senpai! Thanks for all your hard work!


Oh? You&#39;re… Nagumo-kun from Ryuseitai, right? Looks like you&#39;re hard at it ♪

Woah, to think a member of Eden knows my name… Makes me real happy! Are you taking a break right now?

Well, kinda. Nagumo-kun, you work out here pretty often too, don&#39;t ya?
I haven&#39;t gotten a chance to chat with you &#39;til now, but I&#39;d been wanting to after seeing you in here every now and then. I mean, it seems like you train a whole lot…

Really!? To be honest, I&#39;ve also been super curious about your abs! You got to show ‘em off in the workout feature for that health and fitness magazine, right?
I&#39;m always sure to buy it whenever it features something about workouts, and my jaw was on the floor at how jacked you were in all your photos!

That so~? I&#39;m glad to hear it ♪ When I heard I&#39;d be on the cover, I revised my whole training routine to focus on my abs and stuff, up &#39;til the shoot…♪
Which area are ya focusing on right now, Nagumo-kun?

Hm, good question… Thing is, I&#39;m tryna figure out what&#39;s the best area to build up if I wanna get stronger.
I do karate, and just got my blackbelt the other day… but training to get it really made me have a hard think on what it takes to seriously build yourself.
I tried to pinpoint exactly what could help me power myself up a notch, so now I just wanna focus as much as I can on making those key points of my body stronger!
I’m no good at using my brain, but I&#39;m sure my body beefin&#39; up&#39;ll tell me just how well I did! &#39;Cuz like, I can see just how much I&#39;ve grown through all my training and matches~♪

Oh, I totally getcha. Nothing beats getting to see all your gains, huh~?
That&#39;s why I like working out. At first it was kinda just something forced onto me, but as it grew into a habit, I guess I really started to enjoy it.
I&#39;ve stuck to it to the point that nowadays I&#39;ll feel like shit if I skip a day.
Well, even without that keeping me going, I&#39;d just fall behind everyone if I don&#39;t continue training. I&#39;ll keep up the grind from here on out~

Yeah, right!? You can’t get buff in a day, after all! For real, I totally getcha…!


But y&#39;know, I end up with folks complaining sometimes &#39;bout all the training I do.
They&#39;ll go on about how much I stink of sweat, or that I should worry &#39;bout my clothes not fitting me, or how it&#39;s not beautiful to be so buff…

Ooh, just looking at your face tells me you&#39;ve gone through a whole lot. What d&#39;you do when that happens?

If I feel like I&#39;ve gotten too buff and I&#39;m starting to slow down &#39;cause of it, I&#39;ll ease up a lil&#39;. Like last summer, for example — I cut down a lot on exercise, y’know~

On that note… What do you do when someone says you stink of sweat?

Hmm, well… Back when I lived with Ohii-san in the Reimei dorms, I mostly waved it off, really.
But after moving to Starmony Dorm, my roomie&#39;s never really complained… So now I actually do try to be considerate and make sure to shower and all?

Ah, so I really should do that… I mean, I could never just “wave it off” myself, so…!

…Nagumo-kun, have you gotten told off for smelling like sweat, too?

Erm, not yet. But since my roommates tend to spray perfume on themselves…
It feels a lil&#39; wrong to be working out in our dorm. I&#39;d feel bad stinking up the place with my sweat, so I’m tryna figure out what to do about it.

Makes sense~ That&#39;s the tricky part of sharing a room, huh? Well, my two cents is that the best thing to do is to make sure you shower after every session.
As for what else you can do… You could use this training room or go for a jog &#39;round ES. I mean, you can always train somewhere outside your room, right~?

Ah, so I wasn’t far off the mark! Y’see, they told me not to worry about working out in our room, so I couldn&#39;t really ask &#39;em what the best choice was…
That’s why I’m real glad I can talk to you about all this, Sazanami-senpai!

Right back at ya. I never get the chance to really chat &#39;bout working out like this, so I&#39;m glad, too. In my opinion, training&#39;s pretty awesome.

You know it! It’s too bad no one else really gets how we feel about it, though. Like, my teammate Midori-kun always makes a face at me when I invite him over to work out.

Speaking of Takamine-kun… He gave me some broccoli just the other day.[1] Seeing him suddenly whip some veggies outta his bag was a serious surprise, I tell ya.

Oh yeah, that stuff’s good for building muscle! He also gives some to me pretty often~♪ Sometimes even avocados and stuff, too!

Ooh, speaking of avocados, I think they&#39;re on today&#39;s canteen menu—
…Hang on, sorry if I&#39;ve been kinda pushy with chatting. I bet I’m getting in the way of your training, aren’t I?

Nah, not at all! If anything, I&#39;m sorry for getting so caught up in our conversation!
But man, talking with you is reminding me all over again why working out&#39;s so awesome. On top of building my muscles, I get to be inspired by my seniors as well as so much else!


Haha. All thanks to working out — or you could even say we got to bond through our muscles, right~? Working out is seriously so rewarding ♪

Yeah, we owe this bonding session all to exercise…♪


    Location: ES Hallway


(H-Huuuh…!? Just how did you two end up at this kinda conclusion…?)
(I got curious when I heard my name and listened in, but this convo&#39;s got me totally lost…)
(The hell does “bond through our muscles” even mean? Nothing makes sense in the slightest… The only thing I understand is that Tetora-kun ditched me to get to know an extrovert…)
(Ughhh… Now I don’t want him getting any more buff than he already is. From now on he&#39;s not getting any broccoli or avocado from me…!)

Chapter 1

    Season: Summer


    Location: Floating Garden


(Shu-tatatata… I’ve made it~♪)
(It seems like Anzu-dono’s not here yet. There’s still some time before we have to meet, so I will wait for her on the bench.)
(It’s my turn to get a personalized outfit at last. I’m so happy, I can’t stop grinning~)
(A one and only special outfit made just for me… Mhm, sounds amazing!)
(I’m really looking forward to seeing how it will turn out!)
Ah, it’s Anzu-dono! Heeey, Anzu-dono~☆ I’m over here~
Come, come, sit next to me! …Oh, no, I also just got here.
The weather today is really nice, I should have brought my lunchbox with me. It would have felt like a picnic since we’re in the Floating Gar—
Ah, forgive me. I strayed off topic.
We are going to talk about my personalized outfit, right? I assure you that I did not forget!
But I do not know how the procedure works. If it’s alright, would you please teach me~?
…Wow, you even prepared a design idea notebook for me?
Okay! I will take a look right away. Let’s see…♪


    10 minutes later…

Hmm~, all of these design ideas can be summed up with one word: brilliant!
To think you had this much data on ninjas… Are you perhaps a ninja lover as well, Anzu-dono?
You are not, but you did prepare all of this for my sake? Even though you’re so busy… I’m extremely grateful!
Mhm, I agree. I also think the ninja motifs are great. You sure understand me well~♪
I cannot wait for the finished product. I’m excited to see what kind of ninja attire it will turn out to be♪
…Huh? You want my opinion…?
I would not know what to add to this, though. All of your design suggestions were very detailed and perfect already, so—
It isn’t perfect since you have yet to implement my request into the design, you say? I see… Hmmm~…
I wish for the outfit to be like a ninja, so I do not have any other desires beyond that… Hmmm, it is hard to give you an immediate answer.
…You want me to carefully think about it with the rough sketch you plan to make?
Understood! It’ll be easier for me to visualize what I want if I have a drawing, so that would be very helpful.
I’m looking forward to the rough sketch~. Well then, Anzu-dono, I shall leave it to you!


    Location: Staff Cafeteria



    Hours later…

Hmhmhm~♪ My own~ personalized outfit~♪ Hmhmhm~♪

You sound like you’re in a good mood, huh~? Hope you don’t mind me sittin’ here.

Be my guest~♪ Are you also having a late lunch, Tetora-kun?

Yep. I just got here a second ago since my job starts in the evening.
Anyway, are you next in line to get a personalized outfit?

Ehhh!? How did you know!? I have not told anyone yet…

You said it yourself— Or well, you were humming a song, y’know? Going all, “my own~ personalized outfit~♪”.

R-really? I did not realize I was doing that… Uuu, so embarrassing~

Ahaha, you’re just that happy &#39;bout it, so it makes sense. It’s your very own outfit, after all!
There’s a ton of idols in here, so it doesn’t really hit home when the topic of “personalized outfits” comes up, but…
Now that you, a member of Ryuseitai, have been chosen as the next idol, it’s finally hittin’ me that this really is happening. I’m excited for the day I’m chosen to be up next! ☆
Speaking of, what’s yours gonna be like? I’m guessing something ninja-like?

Yes! Actually—
Oh! I got a message from Anzu-dono on HoldHands. Excuse me for a moment, Tetora-kun.

‘Kay. Don’t mind me, I’ll just be chowing down.

(She sent over the finished rough sketch already… Even though we only just talked about it this very morning.)
(It’s a splendid ninja attire design that suits me well. I feel like this is good enough, and there’s no point in me pondering anymore about it.)
(However, Anzu-dono sought out my opinion. I wonder if it will trouble her instead if I say nothing at all…?)

…Shinobu-kun, what’s wrong? Your face is all puckered, like the time you ate something sour, y’know?

The truth is, I received a rough sketch of my personalized outfit from Anzu-dono, and it looks like this—

Ohhh~ The design isn’t just ninja-themed, it’s even showing off what makes you you. You can really tell this is one of Anzu-Anego’s designs!

What makes me, me?

Yup! You may be small in size, but your relentless mentality is why you’re so manly and cool.
This outfit really highlights your fortitude to never give in no matter what happens.
And that fortitude reminds me of the time you jumped through a ring of fire; that was so awesome!

Hehehe, you’re going to make me blush~. You really do pay close attention to me, don’t you? ♪
(It is not just Tetora-kun, but Anzu-dono as well… Here, I have many comrades who pay close attention to me and accept me for who I am.)
(Everyday is a blessing — I want to tell that to my past self[1], who was all alone…)
(I want to tell him that it’s okay to love what you love. Because people who will accept that about you are definitely out there in the world.)
(Because a place where you can voice that love of yours so loudly is out there, too.)
(I am proof of that. Because I refused to abandon my dreams, this Sengoku Shinobu is able to stand here right now.)
(If I can convey that to the people who are like my past self by wearing this ninja attire—)
…Ah, that’s it!

Chapter 2

    Location: Dormitory Library


Hmm. As I expected; nobody is around when it is this late at night.
I won’t be in anyone’s way if I do it here. After all, it’d be inexcusable to scatter things around in the room and make a mess this late.
Heave-ho… Alright then, it’s time to open this wicker box[2] of memories~♪
Nihihi. These photos and handmade picture scrolls really bring me back. I did not have a master or any ninja companions, so I had to learn everything through imitation at first.
I would constantly practice throwing origami shuriken at the tree everyday, even though they can’t pierce into anything at all…
And the very first item I bought with my own money is this shuriken toy — the thing that started everything.
Mm—! I can feel a presence…!


    Fades to black for a moment…

(Phew, that was close. To think that someone would come here during this time of the night…)
(Ah, wait! I ended up hiding myself with the Camouflage Jutsu out of habit…! Even though I have nothing to feel guilty about…!)

Goodness&#39; sake… Neglecting to return a book is so ill-mannered. And it just had to be under my name, too…

(This voice sounds like Suou-kun. Hmm, I see — it seems like he’s here to return a book.)
(I feel awkward staying hidden, but this does not seem to be the right mood for a conversation, so I’ll stay still and wait until he leaves.)
(…Wahhh!? Oh no, I left my box on the floor! If he discovers it, he’ll immediately find it suspicious. I must quickly retrieve it—)
(Slowly reach out your hand… Little by little…)

Oh? There’s a strange box here—
Eeep! A hand came out of the bookshelf— Don’t tell me it’s a ghost…!?

Ahh~! It is not a ghost, it’s me!

S-Shinobu-kun? What are you doing here…?

That wicker box is filled with my treasured items, and just as I was reminiscing about the memories of my past…
I was surprised by your approaching presence and hid myself out of habit. I apologize for startling you~

Oh, so that’s what this box was. This origami shuriken that fell down — is this one of your treasured items, as well?

That’s right. It’s the first shuriken I ever made! Thank you for picking it up for me, Suou-kun.

You’re welcome. You’ve always had dexterous hands, I see.

Back in those days, I had no choice but to make them myself~. So most of the things in this box are handmade~♪

Marvelous! There are so many ninja-related items in here… I can tell that you truly do not give up when it comes to the values you have, as well as where you individuality is concerned — How splendid. ♪

Me? Splendid?

Yes, very much so. People always keep their interests and ambitions deep within their heart.
However, not everyone can make their dream come true. It is not uncommon for people to give up halfway.
Yet you were able to continue staying the way you wished to be. Your level of persistence is not of the ordinary.

For me, being a ninja is not painful. But I’m very happy to hear such praises.
However, I’m still not fully-fledged yet. I will continue to work hard at my training as a ninja~!

Fufu, that’s the spirit~♪
Ahh, but please do refrain from startling people like you did earlier.


    Location: StarPro Office



    The next day…

Anzu-dono, I apologize for asking you to come here so suddenly. But I have something that I really want to give you…
Since you’re making my personalized outfit for me, I want you to accept this!


This plastic shuriken clearly looks like a toy and has scratches all over, but it is also the very first item I bought with my own pocket money — it is my dearest treasure.
This simple toy is proof of how that tiny first-step I took in the past has helped to make me the ninja I am now.
I’m still inexperienced, so this might be an aspiration beyond my capabilities right now—
But I want to become a heroic ninja — one that can be the “light of hope” to people who have things they love, yet who are afraid of turning that love into a dream they can hold.
That’s why I want to add a large shuriken like this one to the design you made, Anzu-dono! So that all of those people can easily spot it!
So everyone can see how I daringly chase after my own dreams—!
…Ehehe. I knew you would say that. I’m counting on you, Anzu-dono~♪
Thank you for always watching over me. Because you and my comrades are here for me, I am able to truly live my life…♪

Translation Notes
Originally, the story title was katsute no boku e (かつての『ぼく』へ), lit. “To who I once was”. However, to convey the significance of the pronoun used, we chose to translate it like this. Explanation is in the translation note below:
↑ He refers to his past self with boku instead of sessha, the first-person pronoun Shinobu usually uses. boku is a common first-person pronoun for boys, but sessha is a first-person pronoun specifically known to be used by ninjas.↑ Tsudzura (葛籠): A traditional Japanese lacquer wicker basket made with bamboo and lined with Japanese washi paper.

(I thought going to school would be a waste of time, but since I got advice from idols, I figured that I could try going to my club…)
(And boy, was that the bestest, greatest idea I’ve ever had! Both Morisawa-senpai and Takamine-senpai were there!)
(I couldn’t take my eyes off of them, not when they were wearing basketball uniforms for once! It was like candid photos flashing before my eyes! So raa~vely!)
(Everything’s all thanks to that radio!)
(I wanna send them another message thanking them, but UNDEAD aren’t the hosts this month.)
(I could also just thank them in person, but you’re not supposed to do that as a fan. I gotta make a line between what I do in my private time and what I do for work as an idol.)
(Besides, it’ll be tricky to send a message on another occasion if they find out that the “Love-swan” pen name was me.)
(I did my best keeping it a secret that every week, I’ve been listening to their podcast in bed with my earphones! I don’t want all of my effort to go to waste!)[1]
(—…Oh, he’s here!)


(Sigh… so depressing…)
(That guy told me upfront that he’s showing up to the club as a former club member, so I tried coming, too…)
(But the club recently got a lot of new members I dunno anything about… and it was painful being asked for basketball advice…)
(I’m not an expert in basketball. You guys need to ask someone who’s actually passionate about it.)
(They asked me if I could show up to the club again while I was getting ready to go home, but I’m gonna be busy with work for a while… so it makes sense if I can’t come, right? Right.)
(I’m gonna try avoiding our clubroom so they don’t talk to me…)
(I left the place as fast as I could, but maybe I should wait for Morisawa-senpai…)
(He said that he’s going to the staff room first, though… Mmm…)
(I dunno when he’s coming back, so I can just go back on my own, right…)
(Yeah, let’s go. Sigh, so tired…)

Takamine-senpai, thank you for your hard work today!

—W-Woah?
You surprised me… Umm, you’re Shiratori-kun from Alkaloid, right? Uh, what’re you doing here…?

I was waiting for you. I wanted to talk to you about the Basketball Club.

Basketball Club…?

We were on the same team today. Did you forget already?

(Is he one of the many first years in the club…? I must’ve not noticed him there. I was avoiding eye contact with them so they wouldn’t ask me any questions.)
Sorry, I don’t remember.

(Ahaha… That’s kind of a shame.)
Please don’t worry about it! I’m happy enough that we were on the same team together~♪
If you’re heading for the dormitory, could we go there together?

(Uuu… I wanna say no… I can’t walk with people I don’t know well… I wouldn’t know what to talk about…)
(But I just said that I don’t remember him, so I’m already starting to feel bad…)
… Sure, why not.

Yaaay! ♪ Thank you so much, Takamine-senpai~☆

M-Mhm…
(I’m such a bore to be with, though… He’s just gonna be disappointed…)


    Location: Time Street


—And the look you had in your eyes right when you got the ball was super duper ra-vely!

“Ra-vely”…?

Yes! The sweat flying off of you and your heavy breathing! You look so handsome no matter what you do — your very being is fanservice to people!

Uh…Uh-huh…
(This kid’s been watching me reaaally closely… Now I’m worried… I hope I wasn’t acting oddly back then…)

I’m so glad I got to see your basketball moves up close! And I get to go home with you, too! I’m super happy right now! Hehe~ I’m so glad I’m an idol…♪

Ah, yeah, you like idols… I’m guessing that you tell other idols how happy and glad you are, too.

Yup, you bet it! Every idol has something great about them, and I love each and every one of them~!
Like, you’ve got a slightly different feel to you depending on whether you’re in Ryuseitai-M or Ryuseitai-N.[2]
Your expressions are a little softer when you’re in Ryuseitai-M, it’s sooo ra-vely~♪

D-Don’t talk about me… I’ll die from embarrassment…

Today was so fulfilling~♪ To be honest, I hadn’t been showing up to the club ‘cause I thought there was no point to it.
But I was wrong! I mean, I got to make precious memories with my seniors just today!

Mmm… I dunno, I still think that it doesn’t really have much of a point to it.
It’s also been a while since I showed up, and it was honestly a pain… There were way too many people. I just had my energy drained…

Really? But you looked like you were really having fun playing with Morisawa-senpai.

What… No way…


There you are, Takamine! You didn’t have to leave without me! That’s mean!

Ugh, there he is…

It’s Morisawa-senpai~! Wow, it’s like, “speak of the devil” and stuff, huh? ♪

Oh? You were talking about me?


No, um, we weren’t. Don’t worry about it…

Hmm? Well, alright. You two worked hard in the club today — are you feeling hungry?
Let’s eat at a cheap restaurant before we head home! It’ll be my treat, since I’m a former club member…☆

Yaaay! ♪ I wanna go, I wanna go~!

You just butted into this conversation like it’s normal… Why’re all three of us going back together now…?

C’mon, Takamine-senpai, let’s gooo~!

What’s wrong, Takamine? I’ll carry you on my back if you’re tired!

Ughh, Shiratori-kun, don’t drag me with you… And Morisawa-senpai, you’re just as tired as I am, so quit overdoing it already…

(Going around places before heading home is the perfect way to enjoy my school life~! So ra-vely!)
(Not to mention, how super duper rare it is to see Takamine-senpai in his school uniform next to Morisawa-senpai! Hehehe~ I made another wonderful memory to remember~♪)

    Season: Summer


    Location: Starmony Dorm Common Room


(Crap… I can’t think of any idol I’m close to…)
(I had a bad feeling about this… I shouldn’t have accepted that magazine interview so thoughtlessly.)
(I don’t think it’s too late to reject the offer if I ask the agency to do it for me, but… I shouldn’t do that, should I…)
(I don’t want there to be complications between our agency and the client, all because of me…)
(But being close to someone isn’t the same as just knowing them, right? It’s practically the same level as “friends”…)
(And it’s hard to tell if it’s only me who considers them a friend… What if they think I’m being rude for writing them down as one…?)
(Ahhhh… Just thinking about it makes me wanna die…)
(Maybe I should go for the safe answer and say Tetora-kun or Shinobu-kun… But if I write someone from Ryuseitai, it’ll basically sound like I’m saying I don’t have any friends…)
(Urghh… Why do I have to write about my relationships, anyway? What does anyone get out of knowing that…)

Yoohoo, Midori-kun~♪ Why’re you holding your head?

…Must be nice, Hinata-kun. I bet you have loads of friends.

Um, what’re you on about?

I’ve got a job related to an interview project, but I have to answer this survey first.
And they dropped a really hard question in there, asking me which idols I’m close to…
I don’t have anyone like that… Ahh, this is so depressing. Maybe I’ll just leave it blank…

Oh, I get it now~ If you’re that unsure, then how about writing my name?

Um, no, you’re just somebody I know…

Oh c’mon now! I think of you as a friend, y’know~? ♪
What’s the difference between a friend and an acquaintance to you? What do I gotta do to be your friend, huh~?

Uurgh, don’t get so close… Um, let’s see…
I guess I’d consider someone I hang out with on my free days a friend…

Got it! Then let’s find the time to hang out together~♪

W-Whaaa…?


    Location: Starmony Dorm Courtyard



    On a day off

(I ended up cracking under pressure…)
(We didn’t even decide what to do together… What’s he planning?)

Heeey, sorry to keep you waiting, Midori-kun~

Ah, Hinata-kun… and—

HaHa~♪ Good morning, Mido-chan! Sora will greet when he meets someone in the morning~♪

Me too~! ‘Morning, Midori-chan!

U-um. G’morning…?

Yesterday, I talked to Mitsuru-kun and Sora-kun about our plans today when we were eating lunch in the cafeteria.
They both had a free day too, so I invited them to hang. The more the merrier, after all~♪

Sora wanted to play with Mido-chan! Sora is very excited~♪

That’s appreciated…
(Harukawa-kun and Tenma-kun are the good, friendly type, so I know there’s no reason to be so stiff, but…)
(Those three are way better at socializing than I am… I feel like I’m out of place here…)

Midori-chan, what’s wrong? You don’t wanna play with me?

N-no… That’s not…

Really!? Yay! I already thought up what we could play together!
Let’s start with a race! Time to dash dash dash~☆

HiHi~♪ Sora’s going to chase after Mitsu-chan~♪

Isn’t this just running around…?

It’s gonna be good exercise for us. Let’s run too, Midori-kun!

Whaa? Are you for real?

‘Course I am! I promised we’d hang out today, didn’t I?
Let’s move our bodies and laugh until we can’t anymore! Like friends, yeah? ♪


I-I can’t move anymore…

Ahaha, take a rest~♪ You did your best to keep up with Mitsuru-kun and Sora-kun, huh~ Good job, good job~♪

No, that’s not it… I just didn’t wanna disappoint them when they came here just for me…

Ohh~ You’re so kind, Midori-kun.
So? Did you have fun?

I did, but I’d only wanna do this once in a while… I prefer taking it easy in my room on holidays.
(I was dragged into other games too, like tag and hide-and-seek, but…)
(I didn’t hate it. Even though I’m so exhausted now…)
(Maybe the reason I wouldn’t mind hanging out again… is because I see them as friends?)
Hey, about the survey I have to do… Could I write your name down for the “which idols are you close to” question, Hinata-kun…?
Tenma-kun and Harukawa-kun, too… It’s alright if you don’t want me to, though…

Sora would never mind! Sora and Mido-chan are friends~♪

Me too! I wanna get closer and closer to you, so let’s hang out again!

Ahaha, then how about we hang out next week, too? ♪ ‘Cause we’re all friends here~

Next week? Urghh, I just said I’d rather do this once in a while…
(Oh yeah, wasn’t there another question that asked what I do on my free days…? I wrote down a safe answer like reading manga and stuff, but—)
(I’ll write down what happened today instead. ‘Cause we’re bound to hang out together again, anyway…♪)

    Season: Winter


    Location: Corridor


Oh, so that’s who’s been walking with his head down — Hey, Midori-kun! Are you heading home now?

…Yuuta-kun?

What’s with that response? Was it that surprising that I greeted you?

Well, we aren’t on such close terms to talk to each other, so, yeah… Also, usually the one who talks to me is your older brother…

Wow, you didn’t hesitate to answer that way, huh. Even after all the strawberry picking we did together…
Also, I feel like it’s kind of nonsensical to refer to us as “older brother” and “younger brother” at this point, y’know~

Strawberry picking, huh… That feels like so long ago now… I wonder if I’ll have to help out again this year…

He completely ignored the other half of what I said…

Please let my spring holidays go okay… Please don’t make me help out with anything…
(—That being said, this feels weird. Maybe it’s ‘cause Yuuta-kun grew out his hair…)
(I’ve only ever seen him with the same hairstyle as Hinata-kun, so…)

Why’re you staring at my head? Did my hairstyle pique your interest?

Not really. It’s a pain, and I’m barely interested…

A-A pain…!?


Yeah, like, I don&#39;t really wanna know why you grew out your ha—Woah!?

Do you even know how it feels to be told you’re a “pain” by someone as pretty as you!?

I don’t… but please don’t tug at my arm out of nowhere…

I can’t believe you’d reply to someone asking how their new hairdo looks with “a pain”… You’d be beaten to the floor if it weren’t for your pretty face, m’kay?

You didn’t ask me that way, and I don’t approve of violence, okay…
(But I can tell this whole situation’s turned into an actual pain… Why’s he so insistent to talk to me…?)

Alright, you leave me no choice! Midori-kun, come with me!

Whaaa…?


    Location: Empty Classroom


Alright, sit on the teacher’s podium.

(I just wanna head home… But he dragged me here by force, so maybe I’ll get to leave if I just listen to what he has to say for now…)
I have a genuine question but, did you have something to talk to me about…?

I didn’t, until just a second ago. I mean, think about it—
I grew out my hair because I wanted you to look at me, and was so nervous to find out what you’d say—

Erm, you didn’t grow it out for me, though, right?

Only for you to tell me it’s a pain! That you’re barely interested! Of all things, a “pain”!?

Umm, well, that’s ‘cause—
Even if you did tell me why, I don’t really care either way… I think we’re all free to do whatever we like to our hair… It’s not really something I particularly care about, so…

Erm, you didn’t get into this much detail earlier, y’know…? Also, I see you now added “don’t really care” on top of everything, huh…
Well, I suppose when it comes to the two of us — our faces are the same even if we do change our hairdos.

…Well, yeah, ‘cause you’re twins.

Mmm~ What a clear-cut response.
Anyway, I know it’s a bit odd for me to ask directly, but don’t you have an actual compliment you could give me?

Compliment…

I mean, I changed how I look and everything. I’d love a compliment or two.

Compliment…?
(I don’t really know what I could say… Actually, Yuuta-kun’s reeeally pushy today, huh…)
(He may not let me off until I give him one…)

Ahaha, first you’re staring at me, now you’re looking away in deep thought… This is fun to watch~♪
So? Could you come up with a nice compliment?

No… I’m not really good at complimenting people in the first place…
Whenever I do compliment someone, their response is just something like, “wow, that’s rare”… And whenever I get complimented, I just start to overthink what they could even mean by those words…

Ahh~… Yeah, I get what you mean — I also get really exaggerated responses sometimes when I give honest compliments.
But that’s exactly why I’d love to get a compliment from you, Midori-kun! C’mon, you’ve got this!

Erm, there’s nothing to get here, though…?
(Since his hair’s long, it must be more work to wash and dry it… And tying it up every day must add more to the workload.)
(But maybe it’s easier having it tied up…? Ah, speaking of which—)
It’s gotten easier to distinguish you from Hinata-kun, which is nice.

…………

Was that not good enough?

More like, was that even a compliment? I can’t even tell if that was a positive comment or not!

Oh… I thought that, since it’s no longer possible to mix you two up, I wouldn’t end up making you feel uncomfortable…

Oh, I see. Well, I guess that’s your way of being kind, yeah…

…Anyway, sorry, but — I have to help out at my family&#39;s greengrocer store, so could I go now?

Huh? Oh, yeah, sure. Sorry for keeping you here, I had no idea.
Alright then, we’ll keep the compliment for when we see each other tomorrow! See you later, Midori-kun~♪

Whaa— You’re gonna keep at it…?


    Location: Shoe Locker



    Next day…

Ah, Midori-kun! Good morning~

(Uu, I don’t have to turn around to know who it is… The first person I meet in the morning has gotta be—)
Good morning, Yuuta-kun…

Ahaha. Is it that awkward to see me after what happened yesterday?

No, it’s more like—…
(I felt so restless and nervous after he told me to give him a compliment the next day…)
(But it’s best to give him one now, right? I just need to make sure it isn’t offensive, and something positive…)
…Yuuta-kun.

Hm?

That hairstyle really suits the current you. It’s pretty nice, isn’t it…?

…Ah—Huh? Um, did you just compliment my hair…?

You told me to yesterday…

Ahaha, oh yeah, I did, huh? Wow, I didn’t expect you to actually compliment me…♪

…Why’re you laughing?

Sorry, sorry. I just wanted to get back at you for saying it’s a pain that I was talking to you, so I teased you a little.

…? Wait, so you were just messing with me?
Sigh… I’m so depressed… I thought about it for so long, too…

I’m sorry, really. Thanks for giving it a deep thought. I’m really happy to get a compliment about who I am right now! ♪
If I ever try changing up my hairstyle, will you share your thoughts with me again?

Um, no… That um, really does sound like a pain…

    Season: Winter


    Location: Tetora, Arashi, HiMERU Dorm Room


Hmhmhmm…♪ I’m back~!

Oh? Welcome back, Tetora-kun.
You’re done with work? That was quick… Didn’t you say you’d take until late at night? So I was expecting you to come back by midnight.

Ossu! That’s what I thought too, but I managed to get it done way earlier than expected~

Ahh, I see. Well, I’m glad you were able to finish up work without any probl—
Kyaah!

Woah!? W-What’s wrong? You surprised me with that scream!

Oh my gosh, Tetora-kun! Your ear! Your earlobe!!

Huh?

You’re bleeding from your earlobe!

Mm…?
Ahh, you’re right… I guess the piercing hole isn’t fully formed yet, so maybe my earlobe ended up bleeding from the piercing getting caught in somethin’.

Ah— Don’t wipe it like that! You’ll get an infection!
Come here, I’ll give you a hot soak.

H-Hot sook…?[1] What’s that mean? It sounds kinda tasty, like soup…

Gosh, no. It’s when you use warm saltwater on an infected area to help it heal faster.
Piercing holes are delicate, so we can’t use disinfectant.
Anyway, don’t worry, I won’t hurt you! So come sit here, and stay still.

Ossu, please go ahead, then!


    Time passes…

(Tap, tap)… Alright, all done!
Oh? This piercing… It’s not the usual one you wear, is it?

Ahh, yeah. I had a specific kinda job to do today, and went with a transparent one, so that nobody could notice it.


But maybe it doesn’t suit me much, ‘cuz it keeps gettin’ caught in clothes and stuff… I think that’s why it started bleedin’ this time.

Mmm, that’s odd… Maybe it’s a defect?
Hmm, and your piercing hole might close up if you don’t keep wearing something until the hole is fully formed…
You know what, how about we go and buy a new one the next time we have a day off? I wanted to window shop for small ear piercings, anyway.
I know a great store we can go to, so would you like to check it out?

Wha— Really!? If it’s something you’d recommend, then ‘course I’d love to!

Alright then. ♪ Let’s go together on our next day off, okay?


    Location: Shopping Mall


Kyaan! ♪ Everything is just so cute! It’s going to be so hard to decide with this many!
Ah~hh… There’s sooo many cute stuff here, but I really want to save my money… This is so frustrating…
Oh my, I got too ahead of myself. We aren’t here for me, anyway.
So, Tetora-kun — Did you find something you like?

Uu~myu, mm… Ah! This looks simple enough.
I do like this style, but I dunno how to be fashionable…
I don’t really have any taste in fashion, so… I’d like to ask for your opinion, Narukami-senpai. What do you think of this?

My my, Tetora-kun! There’s really no need to overthink it. Fashion is all about wearing what you like!
Besides, you do have good taste, you know? That piercing is lovely. I’m sure it’d suit you.

It would? Well, if I got your seal of approval, then it must be the one~♪ Oh yeah, what’s your kinda style, Narukami-senpai?

Me? Hmm, good question…
This one’s nice, I like these kinds… Ah, this one! I love this style. Mmm, it’s such a shame that I can’t buy it right now. I’ll have to come back when I can spare the money.
Well, no matter! We’re here so you can buy a new ear piercing, and we managed to get that done.

Ossu! Alright, I’ll go to the cashier and buy this!

Alright, I’m waiting~ I’ll go check out the clothes store on the other side, okay? Tell me when you’re done!


    Location: Train Station

I’m so glad you managed to find something you like.


Ossu! I expect nothing less from a shop recommended by you, Narukami-senpai. They had a lotta great, cool styles!
I’ll check it out again sometime. Thank you so much!

Fufu, that makes me so happy to hear. I’m really glad I introduced you to it.

—So, here you go.

Huh? What’s this wrapping?

It’s my thanks to you for today. I’m sorry it’s such a simplistic gift, though.

Ehhh!? You don’t have to thank me for anything!
But thank you, I’m so happy. May I open it?

‘Course!

—Oh my! Isn’t this the ear piercing that I said I loved? When did you…?

Heheh. I’m real bad with gifts, so I wasn’t sure what to give ya at first.
But in the end, I just wanna give somethin’ that’d make the person happy! So I secretly researched beforehand what to get you.

…You’re incredible, Tetora-kun.

Huh? Didja say somethin’, Narukami-senpai?
Ah! Is it not good enough for a gift!?

No, it’s perfect. I’m so happy. Thank you so much, I’ll treasure it. ♪

Ahh, I’m so glad you like it! Aight, let’s head home, shall we?

(Mm~… And here I thought he was still just a cute little junior… This makes me excited for the future…♪)

…? Narukami-senpai, what’s wrong? I’m gonna leave without you at this rate~!

Mhm, I’m coming, Tetora-kun!

Chapter 1

    Season: Autumn


    Location: ES Lobby


(Hm? I saw something glittering from the corner of my eye…?)
(…What’s this? A sequin…?)
(There’s more dropped on the floor up ahead, but I see a seashell at the end, too. Did someone place it down here, rather than accidentally drop it…?)
(I’m kinda curious to see how far this goes, so I guess I’ll follow the trail.)
…I feel like I’m walking straight into a trap, but maybe it’s just someone trying to lead me somewhere…?


    Location: Staircase

…There’s more around here, too? Must’ve been rough work for the person behind this.
Oh, it’s going past the door now. How many floors have I gone up by now…?


    Location: Resting Room


…I don’t see any more stuff on the floor. Does this mean I reached the finish line?

Oh? My, my… so the final person was Kaoru-kun?

We were waiting for your arrival, Hakaze…☆

Rei-kun and Moricchi? What do you mean by “final person”? What’re we gathered here for?

Unfortunately, we don’t know why, Either. But I assume we’ll be guided somewhere now that all of us are Here.
—By the Kitten~♪

Sakasaki-kun… and Anzu-chan’s here too!? Okay, seriously, what’s going on here?

Mhm, you came here because you followed the trail of items on the floor, right?
We all experienced the same thing and ended up in this room, which means we’ve been led to gather here.

I thought there’d only be sequins and seashells at First, but I came across some fish scales, Too.

As have I. Fish scales can only mean one thing—I have an inkling of who is behind these acts.

The person in question is waiting for us with preparations at hand?  …Hmm, I see. You’ve been asked to be our guide by Kanata, right?

She tried to keep it vague by saying “person,” but Moricchi blurted out the name anyway…

I’m quite interested to see what Shinkai-kun is preparing, and to hear the reason why we’ve been gathered here. Let’s go meet him right away~♪

Rei-niisan isn’t trying to hide it, Either…
Well, to get back on Track… We’re counting on you to lead the way to “that person,” Kitten.


    Location: Floating Garden


Hellooo? Shinkai-kun~?

everyone~ i’m over here~♪

Hm? Is that an inflatable pool you’re sitting In?

K-Kanataaaa!! What’re you doing bathing in water during the cold season!? You’ll get sick at this rate—
…Hm?


gosh, chiaki, you don’t need to panic so much all the time. please look closely—notice how there’s no water in the pool?
besides, i don’t need to fill a pool with water to bathe. there’s already a pond here.
i could always go inside the pond if i ever wanted to soak in water…♪

You’d freeze yourself either way, silly! Keep that for when the weather is warm again, okay? Promise me that…☆

That’s good to know, but does that mean that the thing you were preparing was this pool?
Though, I can see balls and plushies and other stuff inside…

well… i’ll explain that soon enough. ahem, first off…
thank you for gathering here, everyone.
it took a lot of time and effort to prepare all those sequins, seashells, and fish scales on the floor, you know~ i had to go all over the place.
and i had to do it for four people, too. it was a toughie.

…How did you get away with that with all the security guards Around?

anzu-san did a lot of work behind the scenes for me~♪

It was surprising to see you use sequins. Was that the Little Lady’s idea, perhaps?

fufu, bingo~ anzu-san and i were preparing a looot of stuff so that we could all do a certain thing together~

Certain thing…?

surprise! i’m gifting you all a ticket to participate in the fishing tournament!
now then, everyone, let’s fish together…♪

…?

…?

hmph, what’s with that look on your faces! you get to fish, you know? it’s lots of fun!
can’t you see that kanatee wants to see all of you excited to play? their round eyes are sparkling with anticipation!
i’ve even prepared a prize for the winner. please play in the tournament with all your heart…♪

I don’t really get what’s going on, but for the fishing tournament… Are we gonna use the pool for it?

exactly~ anzu-san and i made a lot of fishies; you can see them in the pool, right?
here we go… (gets up from the pool)
anzu-san, could you pass everyone their fishing rod?

Woah! Since when was she holding those fishing Rods? They look Handmade…

please use these fishing rods to catch the fishies~♪
bring the fishies you catch to me. you get more points depending on the fish caught.

Yeah, I don’t get what’s going on here, but… The two of them seem eager to see this happen, so let’s get started!

Hmm… What on earth is he planning…?

ufufu, do you all have your fishing rods? then let the tournament begin…♪

Chapter 2
Ohhh, I get it now! There’s a magnet attached to the end of the fishing rod, and also to the fish they made! So we just need to pick them up using the magnet, right?

We’re out in the open air, so the string keeps shaking from the wind… And the magnet’s small, so this might actually be harder than it looks.

Won’t the magnet lose grip depending on how large the catch is…?
There appears to be a large plush toy in the pool, but I doubt we could catch it with this rod. Hm, I wonder which fish to catch for myself…

Fufu, it looks like I’m the first one to catch Something.
Here you go, Kanata-niisan. I caught a Clownfish.

great job, nacchan~ you get tickets to aoumi aquarium for catching a clownfish.

A pair of Tickets? I’ll go there with Sora sometime, Then. Thank you~♪

Alright! I got something. I caught a starfish and coral at the same time! Isn’t that amazing?

great job to you too, kaoru~♪ i’ll gift you fresh sashimi for tonight.

Sashimi for me? Guess I’m gonna get to have a fancy dinner tonight~♪

come on, chiaki and rei, you can do it too!

While I wish I could, the ball is obstructing my fishing~… Little Lady, could you move the ball to the side so that I can fish more easily?

Oh, you too?
I wanted to catch the turtle, but it ended up concealing itself under the ball somehow… I won’t be able to catch it at this rate.

oh jeez, i guess i have no choice~ i’ll adjust its placement, so please give it another go.

Heh. Since the two of them are taking a While, maybe I should try catching another One.

Yeah, I wanna catch a fish this time. I’ll try going for a big catch if possible, while I still can~

…♪
anzu-san, what’s wrong?
i look like i’m in a good mood? you’re right~ i’m so glad that everyone is having fun with what i’ve prepared for them.
thank you very much for helping me out with this.
it was a lot of fun drawing so many marine animals and making those fishing rods…♪
so as repayment, i’d like to give you this fishing rod.
…you don’t recall making this one? of course not, i’m the one who made it, after all~♪

Hm? That looks a lot fancier than the ones we have.

The magnet’s bigger, too…? You could catch anything with that.

You could even catch Kanatee, don’t you Think? Try aiming for the magnet on its Back.

…Shinkai-kun, you wanted her to catch the large one from the very start, didn’t you?

fufufu~? look, rei. she’s so good at fishing…♪
—congratulations, anzu-san. your prize for wonderfully catching kanatee is…
the right to think up a design for my personal outfit~♪

Personal outfit?
What do you mean by “right”? Anzu is usually the one to make them in the first place, isn’t she?

Hm, if he went through all the effort to have her catch a huge one just to gift her the Right…
That would mean Kanata-niisan wants his personal outfit to be Made?

…ehehe~♪
i was waiting to see when it would be my turn even before we started preparing for the fishing tournament—
and at one point, i heard that she was going to have time in her schedule for my outfit, so i knew i had to take the chance to plead for it before then.
after all, the rest of ryuseitai received their personal outfits~♪

I did not see this coming at all, but I’m glad for you, Shinkai-kun. Little Lady is nodding with a smile on her face.

yes~ i’m so happy to get the okay from you…♪
…“you could’ve just asked me normally, though”?
mmm… i didn’t want you to just hear my request. i wanted to make the whole process fun before you started on it.
i got to see everyone smiling, and, while i felt a bit nervous, i even got to ask you to design it in a fun way.
it ended up being a good time for everyone, even more than i expected. and you were even smiling all the way… i’m so glad~♪
next time, if i could also have wataru, shu, and the children come over and play with a much bigger pool… i think that’ll turn out to be even more fun…♪

Wouldn’t that take a lot of effort to prepare for? I don’t believe the Kitten will be enough for That, so let me help you out next Time.

Mhm, I’d love to help you two out, as well!

…Hm? It seems like she already has something she needs our help in.

You wanna know what image we have of Kanata-kun to incorporate it into the design? Hmm, let’s see… He’s definitely got the feeling of the ocean and water and stuff.

As for me, I’d say “Blue” from his Ryuseitai position… as in, the color blue. Oh, but he gives off a strong impression of the ocean too, of course.

Hmmm… I can think of many Things, but overall I’d say the waterside comes to Mind. It feels like he’s someone who connects to the sea Itself.

then… how about we go to the sea?
the ocean is where things came to life, so surely ideas for my personal outfit could come to life too if we went there.
come on, everyone. even anzu-san is saying that the sea is very important as part of my personal outfit~

…I feel as though you&#39;re mostly pleading for us to join you, but I don’t mind doing so if it’ll help Anzu with the design process…☆

fufufu~♪ then let’s tidy up and get going.
let’s go search for the perfect ocean for me—

    Season: Summer


    Location: Café Cinnamon


(Huh? Is that… Otogari-senpai over there?)
(Why’s he standing right at the door to the café…? Is he debating whether or not to go inside?)
(Since he’s someone I know, I don’t think I should ignore him… But I’m not close enough with him to greet him, either… What do I do now…?)
(I guess I’ll stand here and wait for him to move.)
(……)
(…………)
(…Uhhh, I don’t think he’s gonna be moving anytime soon.)
(But the café isn’t even packed, so why isn’t he going in?)
(I can’t just stand here waiting… I should greet him and go inside already.)
H-Hello…?

Oh, Takamine.

What’s wrong? Is there something on your mind…?
(Ah, crap—I spoke more than necessary ‘cause he seemed to be at a loss over something. I was only planning to greet him and move on with my life…)

Mm, I came here to try the new desserts they added to the menu, but I can’t decide which one to eat.
I suppose I could get both, but I wouldn’t be able to savor them nearly as much with my attention split between the two.

(Whaaat, that’s it…?)
Um… Then how about we each order one? I’m actually here for a parfait, myself.
And if either of us wanna try the other’s dessert, we could always share a bit…

Does that mean you’ll eat with me? Thank you. You’re very kind, Takamine.

U-Um, I haven’t even done anything yet…

Welcome~!
Oh, it’s the veggie boy and the meat boy![1] Feel free to take a seat wherever you like~♪

Shiina-senpai calls you the veggie boy, I see.

Yeah, it&#39;s ‘cause I deliver veggies here sometimes… And you’re the meat boy, huh? I kinda feel a connection…♪

Takamine-kun, thanks for the new dessert idea you submitted to our contest the other day!
Everyone agreed to add your Mascot Character Parfait to the menu! You’re totally gonna be trying it out today, right?

Umm… Otogari-senpai, may I get the Mascot Character Parfait?

Of course, go ahead. I thought the cute animal-designed ice cream was an impressive idea—
But it never occurred to me that you might’ve been the one behind it. You’re incredible, Takamine.

Oh, no… I just thought of all my greatest dreams and put them together into a dessert, that’s all… It’s way more impressive that they made my idea a reality…
(Otogari-senpai really goes right to praising, huh… He’s so genuine about it that it makes me feel awkward…)

Shiina-senpai, I’d like the Pretty Pudding a la Mode.

Coming right up~ I’m about to take my break, so could I come eat with you guys after I make your dessert?

Huh? Are you asking me…?

Nahaha, who else would I be asking? ‘Course it’s you two.

But we’ve barely talked before…

Mmm? Is there some kinda problem?

I mean… I guess… not, but…

Alrighty, then I’ll take that as a yes! I’ll whip ‘em up for you in a jiffy.

Um, okay…
(Ughhh, I didn’t get the chance to refuse. His pushiness is kinda scary…)


    Ten minutes later

Here they are! Two Mascot Character Parfaits—one for Takamine-kun, and one for me—and one Pretty Pudding a la Mode~!

Wow, it’s so cuuute…! I’m amazed at how you managed to make every single detail of my drawing a reality… Man, it’d be such a waste to eat this.

It’s tiiime to feast~!

Eep!? He sliced the mascot’s face in half…

This is the most efficient way to eat it~♪ (Nom, nom)

Shiina-senpai, your manner of eating is quite pleasing to the eye; you ate so much of it in one clean bite.

(T-That was traumatizing to watch… I’m just gonna focus on my parfait for comfort…)
(Alright, time to take a photo, and—there… This really feels like a dream come true; I didn’t expect to actually win the contest.)


(I wanna indulge in this moment for as long as I can, but my family’s always told me that the Wasteful Ghost would haunt me if I waste my food…)[2]
(I’ll eat it once the ice cream starts to melt. For now, I’ll enjoy looking at it for as long as I can…♪)

You look really happy, Takamine.

Huh? Y-You think so…? I love mascots, and, um… I’m sorry if you think that’s creepy.

Not at all. It makes me happy to see someone else enjoy what they love from the bottom of their heart.
Don’t mind me. Please keep enjoying yourself.

(Gobbles, gulps)… You really do love mascots, huh? You wrote super passionately about them in your contest entry.
Oh, speaking of mascots—Did you check out the mascot character bakery that opened up recently?
I stopped by to check their menu out the other day, and they had a huge variety of stuff. It was pretty cool!

Um, I did wanna visit it, but… When I was out walking the other day, people kept coming up and telling me about how they’ve been supporting my work, and stuff…
So I’ve been trying to be careful about when I go out… It doesn’t help that those sorta places usually have lots of girls, too…

I know how you feel, Takamine. I have a hard time going to cute shops, myself.
Though, I’m also quite interested in that bakery…

Then I’ll make their Mascot Cake for you and Otogari-kun the next time you drop by.

What, is that really alright with you?

Yeah! It’ll be my thanks for delivering meat and veggies to the café all the time~♪
Besides, if it’s just for nutrition, then I can eat on my own, but—
It’s way tastier to eat food with other people, yeah~?

U-Um… Thank you…
(Shiina-senpai scared me at first ‘cause of his party animal vibe, and he wouldn’t stop getting close to me…)
(But if there’s something we could enjoy together, maybe it won’t be so tough to talk with him…?)

Wassuuup~ Ya boy Rinne’s here~♪
I wiped out my whole wallet on pachinko, so gimme somethin’ to eat, Ni—Oh, what’s this?
Well, if it isn’t Otto~ and Midorinrin! You two seem to be eatin’ somethin’ tasty!
Why dontcha share a bite or two with your bro here? C’mon, I’m only askin’ for a li’l…♪

Is “Otto~” meant to be me?

“Midorinrin”…!? Urghhh, party animals really do freak me out…!

    Season: Autumn


    Location: Starmony Dorm 1st Floor Hallway


Yoohoo, Midori-kun~! I’m so glad I caught you here; this makes my life easier~♪

Huh? Were you looking for me…?
Did I do something wrong? I can’t think of anything I could’ve done… Umm…
Sorry anyway, whatever it was…

I know it’s totally like you to apologize without even knowing why, but there’s no need to do that! You didn’t do anything wrong!
If anything, I should be the one apologizing, maybe?
Here&#39;s your math textbook, thanks for lending it to me~ Good thing we&#39;re in different classes, huh? I’m so glad I have you as a friend~♪

Ahh, so that’s why… Yeah, no problem.
You brought it all the way back to the dorms? You could’ve given it to me at school…

I did try looking for you after classes were over, but I couldn’t find you anywhere.
Also, I figured it’s useful to have the book around for reviewing, so I brought it back with me.

Huh? Are you the type to review before class, Hinata-kun…?
Is there really any point to figuring stuff out on your own when the teacher’s right there…? I feel like that’s more likely to take more of your time…

Yeah, I getcha real bad~ I’m not the type to review on my own, either~♪ Classes are enough for me!
I wasn’t sure if you were the same as me, though, so I brought it back just in case you needed it.
But wow, who would’ve known we’d both be the type to skip reviewing~? That&#39;s how you know we’re besties~☆

Uh, there are a lot of other people who don’t do it either, though… Hm?

Ah—It’s Sora-kun! He’s carrying a pretty big backpack with him. I wonder where he’s off to?

HaHa~♪ Sora’s going to have a sleepover party with Shisho~ and Grand-Shisho~!

It’s already late outside, so I’m guessing you mean in the dorms…? Do you really need to pack that much for it?


Mido-chan, would you like to know what’s inside? Sora’ll show you~!
There’s a change of clothes, toothbrush and toothpaste, a cup, snacks, and—

Woah, woah! You don’t have to go through the whole list! Right, Midori-kun?

Y-Yeah. You really surprised me there, I didn’t expect you to open up your bag on the floor…

HiHi~♪ Sora apologizes for surprising you! Please forgive Sora!
Sora will head off to Shisho~’s room now! Bye bye~♪

Mhm, have fun~
A sleepover party, huh? Sounds fun! Hey, Midori-kun, we should throw one, too~♪

Whaa… Don&#39;t wanna…

    Season: Summer


    Location: Dormitory Library


Ohh, Shino-kun! Hello there!

Ah, hello. Fancy seeing you here. Do you need to research something?

Oh, don’t mind me. I have a feeling I’ll be sleeping early tonight, so I just came to find a book to read in bed.
I’m glad we have this library here! I’m so happy I can easily borrow books whenever I want…☆

Heheh, I know what you mean. I always find myself coming to the library.
What kind of books do you usually read, Morisawa-senpai?

I read anything that sparks my interest! But lately, I’ve been too busy to read as much as I used to. I didn’t even decide on what kind of book I wanted to borrow before coming here.
Do you happen to have any recommendations?

Hmm… I could’ve recommended something to you if you had a favorite author, but since you don’t mind anything… Hmmm~…
Oh, I know! How about you take a look at the best-selling books? The members of Biblion compiled all the popular books and placed them into their own special corner over there.
They’re organized into different categories, like new releases, book collections, or literature— I’m sure you’ll be able to find something you like~♪

Ohh, that’s wonderful! I’ll go take a look right now. Thank you, Shino-kun!

You’re welcome. Feel free to ask me for help anytime.

(…Hmm, so these are the best-selling books, huh… Yeah, they’ve compiled a lot of books you’d find in commercials and advertisements.)
(“Drama adaptation coming soon”… Could this be the source material for the show Kiryu’s currently filming?)
(I’m pretty curious, but mystery shows are more immersive when you don’t know how the storyline en—hm?)
(There’s a strange book here… It&#39;s got a pitch-black leather cover — it looks expensive. And is this pattern on the front cover a magic circle…?)
Mmm, this doesn’t seem right… What on earth is this book?

Did something happen, Morisawa-senpai?
Waah… That book looks like something you’d see in a fantasy world, doesn’t it? It’s quite thick, though… Is it some sort of manual, I wonder?
I’ve never seen a book like this before.
…Ah, that reminds me—

Did something come to mind?

Ah, no, it reminded me of the horror movie I watched last month.

Horror movie…?

Yes, a bunch of the idols here decided to watch a horror movie together in the common room — we wanted to fight off the summer heat by giving ourselves some chills.
The movie was about people getting cursed from watching a video with no title.
It’s known to be a very Japanese-style horror movie; just as you&#39;d expect, it kept you on the edge of your seat from start to finish.
One of the scariest scenes was when the ghost slowly creeped out of the TV. We all screamed really loudly—
Loud enough to make other people worry that something happened.
And that’s how we ended up with a lot of people watching the movie together~♪

W-Wow, I didn’t know you had a movie session like that…
(I’m really glad I wasn’t there for it. I wouldn’t have been able to sleep…)

I wonder if we’ll get cursed from this book, just like that untitled video…
Just kidding! That could never happen in real life, right? Let me try opening it; I’m curious about its contents.

N-No, don’t be hasty! We don’t even know what’s written inside, y’know!?

Um, yes…? That’s why I’d like to check—

It’s dangerous to act rashly! Notice how suspicious the pattern looks— What if it is a demonic book made to curse anyone who reads it!? We need to think about this more thoroughly!

But we don’t know what the book is about, so it’ll remain a mystery no matter how much we think it through.
I think the best choice is to find out what kind of book it is and attach a note to it.

Oh gosh, I’m in trouble… I just hope nobody took the book with them…

Ohh…! I was wondering who that was— You seem to be in a rush, Aoba. Did something happen?

You see, I’m looking for somethi—
Ah! That’s the one!
Did you look inside!? Surely you didn’t, right…?

N-No. We didn&#39;t even look at the first page.

Really!? I-I’m sooo glad~…

What do you mean by tha—Ah!? So it really was a cursed book!?
I knew it! Opening it would only bring calamity to the world! The gates of hell would open — the “S” in ES would stand for satan instead of square![1]
I do believe justice would prevail, and love would definitely save the world! But could I really put an end to a demon’s rampage with my love alone!?

Umm, senpai…?

Ummm… Don’t worry, Chiaki-kun. This is actually a notebook for live show production ideas.

A notebook…?

Yes. It would be dull to keep our ideas in a normal notebook, so we’ve been writing them down in a mysterious, magical-looking book to keep in line with Switch’s theme.
I placed it in the bookshelf when I was organizing the books here, but I accidentally ended up piling it up with the rest of the books.

Ahhh, now I understand. Okay then, here’s your notebook back.

Thank you. I’m so grateful you didn’t open it~

S-So that’s what it was… And here I thought it was a cursed book…

Heheh, you aren’t completely wrong, though. Natsume-kun might have put a curse on you if you ended up reading it.

T-That’s not a joke I can laugh at…

In the end, cursed videos and books can’t actually exist. After all, we would be in a lot of trouble if the world could get flipped on its head just by someone opening a book.

I don’t think we can be completely sure of that, y’know? Take a look over here. To tell you the truth—

Whaaat!? So there are cursed books!?
I thankfully found a book to read, so I’ll be taking my leave! Farewell!

There’s a book all about curses, you see— Ah, Chiaki-kun left?
I wanted to show it to him since he sounded worried, but oh well. I’ll tell you about it instead, Hajime-kun.

Thank you. I’ll tell Morisawa-senpai about it later.

Chapter 1

    Season: Autumn


    Location: Meeting Room


—Oh, it’s getting late already. Right, let’s wrap this up. Keito Class ends here for today.

This was such a valuable session, with so much to learn from. Thank you for your guidance, Keito-sama.

Are you just being modest, or…? Because your traditional Japanese eating etiquette was flawless right from the start.

I’m extremely delighted to hear such praise. A butler is a mirror of their master—They cannot present themselves in any shameful manner.
While I do my utmost best to maintain graceful manners at all times, I am liable to perform tasks in my own way the moment I become accustomed to it. I’m grateful to have an opportunity to correct this oversight.

Huh, alright. Well, as long as it came to use for you.
…That said, what’s wrong with you guys over there? You three have been silent this whole time.

You’ve no need to worry about me. I was simply comparing the manners we’ve learnt to my hometown’s in my mind.
They share some similarities, but there are differences as well. Cultural differences are really interesting!

That’s a good way of seeing things. Curiosity helps better your mentality and autonomy.
—Shiratori, you’re next.

Eeep!? M-Me!? Umm…
My head’s all packed with all the stuff I gotta keep in mind, but I swear I’ll learn how to do it right…!
I wouldn’t want people to think I have no manners when I’m on cooking shows and stuff.

I gotta do my best, too~ Improvin’ my manners will benefit Oshisan, after all! He taught me a lot ‘bout it while livin’ in his house.
I think he started with correctin’ me on how ta use chopsticks properly? Man, this takes me back~
I wanna surprise him by gettin’ super good at it while he’s not ‘round, but I dunno if I can remember all the steps when I’m so forgetful…

Then you could try practicing what you’ve learnt as soon as possible! There should be Japanese cuisine on the staff cafeteria menu.

Ohh, yer right~ Our first lesson in Keito Class was ‘bout the importance of reviewin’ an’ practicin’~♪

Wow, that’s a surprisingly good idea coming from you, Hiro-kun! I completely agree~♪ What will you do, Senpai?

I’ll have to pass. I have to tidy up the place.

I’ll stay behind and assist you.

Lemme help out too, then. You’ll get the job done faster with more people ‘round ta help.

Oh, no, please don’t worry. Allow me to handle this. I enjoy tidying up~♪
It’s almost time for lunch. You’ll struggle to find a place to sit once the cafeteria becomes crowded, so I believe it’s best that you head over there as soon as possible.

Very well then! We’ll be taking our leave.

Hasumi-senpai, thank you so much for today~♪

Aight, see ya later~♪

…They lack the knowledge, but they have potential to learn a lot with how earnest they are. Teaching them feels worthwhile.

Fufu, your speech resembles that of a teacher.

To be fair, I am acting as something similar to that. I’m the instructor of Keito Class, after all.
Teacher, huh… That reminds me—How’s it going in Yumenosaki Academy? Anything new?

We’ve been having a peaceful time at the academy. I believe it may be because of our new Student Council President’s disposition.

Heh. I’d love to record you saying that and make Eichi listen to it.
While it appears to be Isara’s policy to settle disputes within the academy with only the current members, just because we’ve graduated doesn’t mean we’ve no relation to each other anymore. Don’t hesitate to ask me for help if you ever need any.

I see… Are you alright with it being a personal concern of mine?

From you? That’s rare. Yeah, go ahead.

Thank you very much. You see, I was approached the other day about my personal outfit.
I have come up with multiple ideas for a design, but none of them feel like what I’ve truly been looking for.
I cannot risk showing this disgraceful side of myself to Eichi-sama and Young Master, so I’ve been at a loss of what to do… I can’t seem to come to a decision.

Hmm… Do you have the designs drawn anywhere?

Yes, here it is.

……..
…What on earth is this?

It’s the designs for my personal outfit.

No, I know that… But you can’t have them looking like this.

Yes, I don’t quite have the aptitude for illustration. There was once a time I received an explanation of a design through the phone, and thus illustrated it in order to convey it to Anzu-san…
But she was simply perplexed by my illustration.[1]

She’s just going to be confused again if you show her this design…
I’ll re-draw it for you. Could you explain to me the ideas you had in mind?


    Ten minutes later…

You not only excel at watercoloring, but pencil sketching, too? You’re quite multi-talented, Keito-sama.
…Oh? How odd, I feel as though I’ve seen this art style before…


You’re just imagining it. …Alright, I’m done.
These designs do feel like they’d suit you, but they also resemble fine’s outfits. I don’t get a feel of your individuality from any of them.

Um… My individuality?
(A butler is someone who supports their master from the shadows. Therefore, wouldn’t my individuality be that I purposely present no personality?)
(However, if I keep my lack of individualism, it will no longer feel like a personal outfit… And such an error would harm the Young Master’s reputation…)
(Should I force some form of individualism within the design? Perhaps I can find something that truly represents me—)
Hm? I hear a knock at the door… Someone is outside.
Please, do come in.

Chapter 2
Oh, Anzu-san? Is there something wrong?
…Ah, this room will be used for a meeting soon?

I don’t recall anyone booking after us when I checked, but… I can see that there’s a meeting after us, indeed.
It seems to have been booked while we were having our class. Let’s leave at once, Fushimi.

Understood.  …What’s wrong, Anzu-san?
Ahh, you’re curious about this illustration? To tell you the truth, I consulted Keito-sama about my personal outfit.
He then sketched the designs out for me as I explained them.
Hm? Mizuhanome-sensei…? I feel as though I’ve heard that name before.

Hold it right there, Anzu—!

…Hmm. Mizuhanome-sensei is Keito-sama’s pen name, as well as your art master?
There was a time he drew posters for the academy? Ahh, that explains why I recognized the name and art style.

Incorrigible! I can’t believe you’d expose my pen name without my permission…

Please do not fret, Mizuhanome-sensei-sama. I will not speak a word of this to anyone.

It’s “Mizuhanome” only. There is no need for the “sensei” part.
I’ll help you with designing your personal outfit as repayment for tidying up the place with me. Tell me when you’ve completed your design and I’ll draw a clean version for you.

Thank you very much for your kind offer.
Fufu, Anzu-san seems delighted to know she’ll be able to see new illustrations from Mizuhanome-sama~♪

Why do you look as though you’ve struck gold or something? Sigh…


    Location: Resting Room



    A while later…

(I attempted to copy after the design Keito-sama illustrated for me, but I can’t seem to get it right.)
(Anzu-san is a busy woman—I must concentrate on finalizing a design so that I may pass it on to her as early as possible.)
(…Oh, speaking of Anzu-san—When she expressed delight about “Mizuhanome-sensei’s new design”, she looked so young and akin to her age.)
(Fufu, it reminds me of when she first transferred to Yumenosaki Academy.)
(We both transferred to the academy at around the same time, and I felt an affinity towards her. We both had the role of supporting something valuable to us—For her, it was idols, and for me, it was my master.)
(You didn’t know left from right back then, and yet you’ve now grown and become a highly respected producer.)


(I wish to serve only the very best for the Young Master too, similar to how you wish to support the many idols around you. I only hope that I manage to present those feelings into my personal outfit…)
(But I cannot seem to formulate it properly onto paper… How frustrating.)
(…? Is someone gazing at me?)

Master Artiiist~…☆
Hello, Master Artist Fushimi, I hope you’re doing well! Is that a new drawing? I’ve been dying to see new art from you…♪
Ahhhh, what is this!? Is it two pill bugs arm wrestling!?
It’s sooo cute~! I’d love to have it! I wanna frame it on my wall…☆

Uhh, erm… These are designs for my personal outfit, so I’m afraid I can’t hand it to you.

Personal outfit… So you’re gonna get an outfit based on what you drew?
I wanted a drawing from you, but that’s somehow even more catered to me! Oh gosh, I can’t wait…☆

Ahh, no, no. Keito-sama will make a clean copy of the design for me, so I believe that it will look entirely different in the end. I haven’t decided which to finalize, though.
I have yet to find the appropriate individuality for my personal outfit. I’ve tried as best as I can, but I cannot seem to come up with something that defines me besides “a butler who supports his master”.

Huh? Isn’t that enough, though…?
I feel like it’s sometimes more overbearing to look at a design if it has a bunch of unique things in it… Ermm, please look at this.

A mascot character key strap…?

This is the local mascot “Alien Tomato”.[2] They’re a mascot born from a tomato farm, and even though being a tomato is the only thing they have going for them, they’re suuuper unique…♪
So I think it’s fine if you had your personal outfit looking like a butler, Master Artist Fushimi. Your fans would probably enjoy seeing you in a formal uniform, anyway…

I see. I overlooked such an important factor to my outfit, didn’t I? Thank you very much, Takamine-sama.
I no longer need this design, so you may have it if you like.


Really!? Yay, yay, thank you so much! I’ll treasure it for the rest of my life…♪
I’m looking forward to seeing your personal outfit, Master Artist. Oh, and—
I’d like your autograph, if that’s okay…♪


    Location: Outfit Room



    A few days later…

(I always wish to remain as a butler worthy of serving the Young Master, and this outfit is meant to represent those feelings.)
(That is why I would like you to be the first one to see it—Because you are the most important person in the world to me.)
Young Master, I apologize for asking you to visit me all the way here.
This is my personal outfit. I requested Anzu-san to tailor it to look similar to that of a butler’s.
What do you think? Am I worthy in your eyes…?

The butler look really suits you, and I can definitely vouch for that, but don’t you think you’re overlooking something important here?

Something important…?

Mhm, you didn’t get this outfit made to only show it to me, after all.
A personal outfit is a one-in-a-kind outfit that is meant to reflect the idol’s views, but it’s also supposed to be a way to make your fans happy.
Your fans are looking forward to seeing you on stage with that outfit. You’ve gotta make sure to go beyond their expectations to make up for all the waiting they’ve done for you!
So you should have more confidence in yourself as an idol. Your fans aren’t looking at you as a butler, but as you, “Fushimi Yuzuru”.

…You’re right. I completely overlooked something so crucial.
Thank you very much, Young Ma—No, Himemiya-senpai.
For your sake, and for my fans as well—I will pour my heart and soul, and continue to perform my utmost best…♪

    Season: Spring


    Location: Doctor's Office


Producer! Wake up, Producer!
…Mmm~? She’s not budging one bit. That’s just too strange! I’m so loud, I was able to have greetings commercialized as a voiced alarm clock!
No, don’t give up yet, me! We just have to keep trying until it works! We’ll be the winners as long as we win by the end—all’s well that ends well!
Okay, I got it! I’ll just have to give you a taste of my voiced alarm clock greetings, as a special treat!
The red flames are the mark of justice! Burning bright red, the sun of life!
Ryusei Red! Morisawa Chiaki!
A new day has come! Come on now, let’s get up and run towards the morning sun!
Wake up, our sixth Ryuseitai warrior, Ryusei Pink…☆
…Huh? “Don’t make me part of Ryuseitai as you please”?
Ahh, y’know, it’s just that I heard the Ryuseitai within the academy, known as “Ryuseitai-N”[1], has gotten a lot of new members recently.
I thought I could get even more people to join us, so that I’d be one step closer to making the whole world into heroes!
If everyone could be reborn as warriors of love who seek peace and hope, then the world would be alright at last! Fuhahaha!! ☆
Don’t worry though, that was obviously all just a joke!
The concept of peace and hope change according to each generation, after all! If everyone thought the exact same way, then it would be over for all of us!
Diversity! Diversity is super important! Do you understand, Producer!?
Fuhaha! Right, right, now that I’ve forced you awake with random and silly nonsense… I have something I’d like to speak to you about!
Mhm, mhm, I’m glad to know you’re fully awake now~♪
Look over here! While the two of us were leisurely sleeping in the doctor’s office, the door was locked shut!
Look, look! It doesn’t open no matter how many times I push or pull!
That’s right! We two alone have been locked shut within this office!
This calls for an emergency, right? I know you’re still only half-awake, but I’d like it if we could think up a plan to break through this situation together!
Also, at first I did think this could be unnecessary of me to do, but… It’s almost midnight. You need to pack up yourself and go home now, before the last train leaves!
I live in the nearby dormitory, so in the worst case scenario, I’d just have to walk back to my dorm. But you’re still commuting from home, right?
Won’t your parents be worried about you if you’re still outside this late?
However, fear not! I could never let a woman walk on her own at night.
As the hero of justice who represents ES, I shall take you back home!
Huh!? Why are you refusing!? That only makes me sad! I don’t plan to do anything suspicious to you, I can promise you that! Please trust me!
Now then, get all your belongings, Producer! And then, let’s take the time to figure out a way to open this locked door together!
…Hm? The office’s door opens with a card, so I wouldn’t be able to open it if I do it the normal way?
Oh, so that’s what it was! Fuhaha, I must still be half-asleep—I completely forgot about that!
Ohh, would you look at that! It opened immediately with the key card! Thank you, you really saved me there!
Though the hero of justice shouldn’t be the one getting saved here, fuhahaha!!
Huh? “Are you really okay”? Why are you worried about me? I mean, I do think I’ve been having a lot of these slip ups lately, probably due to being so busy…
And that’s also led me to tripping on things, bumping into things… I keep getting more and more bruises. Even though I’ve already been laid off from doing any more stunt work, due to how dangerous it is…
Their reasoning being that “you, Morisawa Chiaki, are an idol, and also a super popular star now”…
But I didn&#39;t get this far through hard work just so I could be protected from harm like this.
No one’s letting me do heroic work as much lately, so most of my jobs are just me smiling and babbling on about interesting things that harms nobody…
Well, that’s enjoyable in its own way, but…
Sometimes, I&#39;m just at a loss… I keep wondering, is being nothing more than a pretty flower decor really what I&#39;d been aiming for as my own ideal…?
…Oh! I’m sorry! I accidentally spilled a little too much about my worries!
Don’t worry, I don’t have any complaints nor dissatisfaction towards the jobs that ES gives me, nor even with the current state of my career!
Hehe, for some reason, I can’t help but tell you everything… Nevertheless, if you’re ready to go, then let’s drop this conversation and head home!
And then once you’re at home, take a bath, brush your teeth, prepare yourself for tomorrow’s plans, and go straight to bed! Promise me you will!
Now then, let’s head off, Producer! Here we goooo![2]
…Gah—!?
Urgh, I hit my nose! Does this door automatically lock itself if you don’t open it after a while? I’m still not used to these new surroundings, am I…?
Hehe, you’re the same? Yeah, I’m sure you are. I think you were taking a rest in here just like I was…
Just don’t overdo it, okay? Though I’m not one to say that…
But I’ll be fine, I’m used to hardships! If you’re ever in trouble, just call for me! The hero of justice shall come running for you! Fuhahaha!! ☆

    Season: Spring


    Location: Floating Garden


Hmm~ hmhmhm~♪
Little flowers, make sure you grow wonderfully under the lovely sun…♪
…Wah!? H-Hello, Miss Producer!
Did you hear me humming and talking to myself…? How embarrassing~! Ehehe, I can’t help but feel giddy on a day with such lovely weather…♪
Also, we’re actually allowed to enter ES’ floating garden, but we weren’t allowed on the rooftop at Yumenosaki—
So even though it’s perfectly fine for me to be here, I kind of feel like I’m doing something wrong, and I get this rush of excitement… I end up hanging out here a lot.
Uuu~ I’ve shown you an embarrassing hobby of mine.
…Oh! You don’t have to apologize at all! Don’t worry about it~♪
But, yes— Did you have something you wanted to speak to me about?
No? It was just exhausting to be caught up with so much work, so you came here for a breath of fresh air?
I understand~ Flowers aren’t the only ones who need to bathe in the sun~♪ We need it sometimes, too~
Ehehe. Do you plan on having lunch while you’re at it?
Me too~ I was thinking of having my bento here after I finish watering the flowers.
Since we’re both here, anyway, would it be alright if we had lunch together?
…And there is something I want to talk to you about, Miss Producer.
Ah, it’s nothing important… Ehehe, well, then, I’ll sit next to you~
Alright, let’s say it together. Thank you for the food…♪
(munch, munch) Ah, this is pure bliss~, vegetables grown in spring taste so good. Ah, well, vegetables grown in any season taste good.
But the thawed snow that overcame the cold harsh winter makes the vegetables taste so much sweeter.
And it packs them full of nutrients, as if it&#39;s saying, “We hope you can endure this looong, tough season.”
Eating these spring vegetables that have worked their hardest to grow almost makes me feel like I’m doing something wrong, and my heart races… Hehe, I’m just joking~♪
……
Umm, I can’t just keep chatting away like this, so please let me start talking about something a little more serious. This might just be a misunderstanding, so it’s a little hard to ask…
Erm… Do people feel as though I’m not suitable for Ra*bits…?
Um, no! I suppose I might just be imagining it, but—! Ahh, I shouldn’t be like this— I’m always so prone to worrying…
But lately, I feel like I’ve mostly been doing individual work as myself, rather than as part of Ra*bits…
Or rather, I’ve been getting a lot of jobs that only request me…
Recently, all I’ve been doing is appear in TV shows, especially with that pretty girl idol from my agency, since I’ve interacted with him before.
Ah… As you know, he may be called a “pretty girl idol”, but he’s actually a guy.
It seems like he’s always looking out for me for some reason, and that alone makes me happy, but…
I’ve been getting influenced by his image, so lately I think I’m also being recognized as someone who has feminine looks…
Even magazines have been writing about us, saying: “The hot new topic! The prettiest sisters in the male idol industry!”
Well, of course, I’m very grateful to have my name in the news, no matter what the topic is—
But I’m not a pretty girl, so I feel as though I’m deceiving the whole world… It hurts to think about.
Also, if I’m advertised in that sort of way— Although I can’t say much about Tomoya-kun, since he’s had to dress up as a girl for Theater Club performances…
Mitsuru-kun might feel restricted, and well — He may not be able to properly make the most of his strengths, even though he’s becoming so much cooler recently.
And this kind of development will also make it harder for Ni~chan to return to us, since I think he’s always disliked being called cute.
I just really want to work with those three as Ra*bits again someday…
I’m aware that I’m being selfish… and I’m truly honored to be acknowledged by people, no matter what form of acknowledgement it is.
But, how should I say this, it’s like we’re all slowly falling out of sync with each other… I feel as though we won’t be able to reach the blissful scenery of our dreams, and that terrifies me.
…Ehehe, I’m so sorry for talking about something so strange.
But I wanted to let you know how I’m feeling about this, Miss Producer.
The agency I’m in, Rhylink, was established a long time ago, but it’s been on the decline for so long…
So I’m aware that I can’t get much of a say in how I live in the idol industry.
But there are times when I get tired, or I feel really troubled…
And I’d be really happy if you could notice when those times come, and support me as much as you can.
No — My heart will be saved just by you understanding that I’m in a tough situation, and cheering me on with a “Do your best!”
I’ll be able to work hard just by hearing that. I’ll make sure to do my absolute best, so… Please show me your support, Miss Producer~♪

    Season: Spring


    Location: Staff Cafeteria


Hmhmhm~♪
Huh? Woooah— Wazzap, Producer! I hope your work has been going well! Swish! ☆ (salutes)
Ahaha~ Yup, I’m copying Vice Prez Saegusa from my agency!
I bet it’d make him happy to see me do this, ‘cause it’d look like I’m getting attached to him~ Though he could just start finding it annoying if I do it too much♪
Heh. I’ve been thinking of buttering up to the higher-ups, y’see~
CosPro’s always been our enemy, so it feels a little weird to be with them, y’know?
But! It’s the 2wink way of life to be headstrong and adapt to any type of environment! ♪
We’ll do whatever it takes to make sales~ No matter the cost!
Our work is split between two people, so it’s not a pain for us to go all out with jobs, y’see.
For example, Yuuta-kun’s working hard for today, while I take it easy~
We’re taking breathers whenever we need ‘em, which means our jobs are always top-notch! 2wink is always ready to blast off at full power!
We’re the two-in-one twin idols, Aoi Hinata and Aoi Yuuta!
We’re twin stars who can breeze through the world of showbiz better than anyone else...☆
That’s all, folks! Whoops, I just can’t stop promoting us every chance I get~ I think it’s become a habit of mine...?
Hm? You thought it was great? Thankies!
Weeell, I can’t really do anything with CosPro’s policy of prioritizing the Special Students, sooo~ Us outsiders gotta help ourselves here.
I do wish the agency could promote us instead, though~
Ah, no, I’m not criticizing them or anything.
I dunno about the big guns in the agency, but I know you’ve been spreading our name all over, Producer.
And besides, we’re the ones who chose to join CosPro, so~ Can’t start complaining now, or we’d only look silly.
It’s not like we’re not selling at all anyway, and we’re definitely not struggling either.
Heheh. I’m honestly starting to feel pretty good about joining CosPro.
We’re skilled in all kinda things, and we couldn’t use that to our advantage in Yumenosaki Academy alone ‘cause it only really focuses on live shows.
But CosPro adapts to all sorts of idol activities, plus it’s well-established and has a good rep.
There’s all kinds of jobs we can do, from variety shows to acting in movies.
Yup, it’s perfect for “us”! ‘Cause like, if we start picking up every single job we can get our hands on, and put ourselves out there—
2wink’s reputation’ll skyrocket too!
We’ve got loads of people who would want us now! ‘Cause clients benefit from idols who can do anything you ask them to do, yeah?
Everyone’ll praise “us”! I can’t stop myself from laughing with joy, ohohoho~♪
... In fact, I’m starting to feel like all those opening acts we did for other units last year lasted way too long, like a wasted detour...
I mean, I know no sort of experience really goes to waste in the end, but...
I wish I could’ve brought Yuuta-kun somewhere where we can shine brightest way sooner, y’know?
It’s all ‘cause I kept running away... Oh, ah-- Um, it’s nothing.
Anyway, Producer, are you free right now? If you’ve got the time, could you teach me about cooking?
Oh, well, I’ve been cooking since way back, so I can pretty much make almost anything...
But I don’t really trust my sense of taste~ I’d always pretended to like the food I hated, so I’ve started to get confused between the two.
Plus, the food you eat for a healthy diet is different from what people like to see on TV shows, right?
I can make stuff super quick and easy, but I dunno if that’s the right answer to what they’d want on a cooking show, sooo~
I’d like to ask for your opinion on things like this, since you’re a producer.
Yup, 2wink’s gonna have a cooking show soon, though we’ll actually be starting the recording next month.
We’d been invited as guests on all kinds of gourmet shows before, so it seems like we’ve got a reputation of being fun to have around.
And ‘cause of that, some higher-up thought up the idea of making a cooking show with us as the main feature!
That’s one of the many good things about CosPro — They immediately start making decisions based on reputation.
Oh, and their ability to make things a reality every time is pretty great, too. So yeah, they’ve been deciding on what to make the show about.
But you work for CosPro too, so you might’ve heard about it already, right?
Yup, they’re working out the details for it right now.
That’s why I’m here at the cafeteria — It’s gotten a lot of good reviews, so I’m trying out everything on the menu.
Oh, by the way; Yuuta-kun’s currently preparing stuff for a different job.
We’ve been splitting the work between us lately, so we can really get things going for 2wink~
Though that means we only get to be together when we’re on the job, which is pretty lonely...
Not only that, but God was cruel enough to put me in a different dorm room from Yuuta-kun...
Uuu~ I’m super deprived of love~ You gotta be nice to me, Producer♪
Ahaha, thank you! So you’ll give me advice on cooking?
The crybaby trick always works, you’re too easy~... Ah, um, just talkin’ to myself!
Hehe, anyway, CosPro makes a clear distinction between every type of role, so~
We can’t really have much of a say in the show’s details, since our role is to be idols.
But we’re called to the meetings for them, so there isn’t any loss to preparing some ideas, is there?
I’m never taking detours ever again. I’m gonna rush straight in through the shortest path possible — and take Yuuta-kun up to the peak of the idol industry.
No—I’ll make sure to take “us” there.

    Season: Summer


    Location: Staff Cafeteria


Time for a fun, fun lunch break~ hmhmhm~♪
Huh? Oh! It’s Midori-kun! Yoohoo yoohoo, how’ve you been~?
I’ve been doing great! Swish!☆ (salutes)

Huh? Um, well... I haven’t been doing badly, I guess...?
Anyway, why did you salute me...? Were you ever the type to do that...?

Nope. Y’know how we’re in CosPro? I’m copying Vice Prez Saegusa, since he does it so often.
Hehehe~ ‘Cause it’s gonna look like I’m close to him if I do that, y’see~?
We might be able to get more jobs if a higher-up takes a liking to us~
Some people might not like feeling as though they’re being buttered up, buuut this is just another strategy to survive in the idol industry!

Huh... You didn’t look any different from your usual self, but you’ve actually been struggling with a bunch of things, huh...?
I thought CosPro was an enemy to Yumenosaki idols... Um, you’re not being bullied or anything, are you...?
Umm, if you’re alright with talking to me, I could lend an ear if you need to vent...?

Ahaha, thanks for the concern. I’d be lying if I said I wasn’t struggling, but I’m not being bullied or anything like that.
CosPro heavily focuses on your biggest merits, y’see~ So thankfully, we get to do so much more than just idol work.
And we’re idols who can adapt to absolutely any job no matter the situation. The agency treasures idols like that, apparently.
Sure, they prioritize the special students from Reimei and Shuuetsu Academy way more, but we still get to play an active role in the agency.
I don’t regret being in CosPro — I’m actually pretty glad about it~♪

Huh... I would’ve totally regretted joining CosPro... I would’ve kept whining about how depressing it is, day in and out...

Ahaha, you have a habit of saying that, so I doubt joining CosPro would change anything?

True... It is pretty much becoming a thing I say all the time.
I don’t even actually wanna die or anything, nor am I that depressed... But every time I’m feeling even a little tired or drained, I’ll start saying that I’m depressed and wanna die...
I’m a hero though, so I gotta avoid saying depressing stuff like that.

Oh!? You called yourself a hero!?
You were always sooo against being called that when we were first years~ You really grew up, my friend! I genuinely feel happy for you~♪

Woah—! Don’t hug me out of nowhere, Hinata-kun...
Though I guess it’s alright since I’m not carrying any veggie boxes today, so I won’t have to worry about anything spilling out...

Sorry, sorry. Oh wait, would that mean that you bring veggies from your home to this cafeteria, too?

Yep... We deliver to ES as well. I’m glad they buy so much from us, but it’s kind of a pain to carry...

Then that means the vegetables at the salad bar were from you! They’re all so fresh and sweet and tasty~ I kept gobbling more and more~♪

Thank you... I’ll tell my parents you said that.

Mhm, tell ‘em I’ll come over to the shop next time~♪

Okay. I think they’ll give you a discount ‘cause they’ll consider you a friend of mine.

Ah, I appreciate that~! I do have a small patch of veggies in the school’s garden area, but y’know, you gotta actually buy seeds to plant different kinds.
Anyways... I’m guessing you’re here to eat lunch? How about we eat together while we’ve got the chance?

Ah, sure, why not...

Woah!? Seriously!?
Um, I know this is dumb of me to say right after asking you to join me, but I really thought you’d reject my offer with saying something like, “I’d rather take my time while eating on my own”.
I was even thinking up ways to convince you after you’d reject me, so I just got surprised that you accepted it so casually.

I would’ve refused the offer if it was from someone I didn’t know well, but I know you, so...

I see, I see! I’m so happy~ You also think of me as a friend~♪

Um, no, you’re just someone I know...

Tsk—Fiiine. We’re getting along way better than we did last year, so this is good enough for now.
Let’s talk about all kindsa things while we eat! Like our interests and hobbies~
I can only hope this makes us close enough for you to start calling me your friend~♪

Chapter 1

    Season: Autumn


    Location: Resting Room


Sigh… Ughhh…
Mmm~… What do I do now…? Sigh…

Midori-kun, Midori-kun! You’re sighing way more than usual! That’s the thirtieth time I heard it today.

Sorry… I let myself sigh all I want when it’s only you two here…

We don’t mind, we simply would like to know what’s making you sigh so much.

Yup! You don’t have to think about it on your own, we can hear you out! Maybe it’s something we can help you with.

Thanks… The truth is, I heard a rumor in the office that I’m the next one to get a personal outfit…

Oh!? This is wonderful news!
…Hmm? But then why are you so depressed, Midori-kun?

Oh, lemme guess: you’re struggling to figure out what kinda outfit to make it?

Yep, basically…
They’re gonna ask me what kinda outfit I want, right? That’s why I’ve been trying to figure it out on my own ever since…

Woah, you’re actually going for it! That’s incredible of you, Midori-kun~♪

I’d love to know what sort of outfit you have in mind~♪

Uu—! Don’t look at me with those sparkly eyes! I didn’t actually make any real progress…!
Like, I did try thinking of something, but every outfit that comes to mind is something I don’t really wanna wear…
Every idea I can think of is something I’d never want as a personal outfit… and I got so frustrated with myself for all these disappointing ideas… and just kept getting more depressed…

Ahh~ I get it now. That’s what’s been making you sigh so much, huh?

Mhm… I bet you’re disappointed to find out it’s for a stupid reason, right…

We all have our own worries, you know! There’s nothing to be ashamed of.
That said, I’m quite curious about these outfits you wouldn’t want to wear. What kind are you referring to?

Maybe saying it like that is a bit off… It’s more like outfits that’d make me feel odd if I saw myself in them…?
Like outfits that’re too revealing, or fancy suits that’re suffocating to wear…
Outfits that’d feel nerve-wracking ‘cause they’d be doing the talking over me, I guess… I’d hate to have that sorta thing as my personal outfit…
My fans absolutely love seeing photo shoots where I’m wearing cool clothes, but…
I always feel weird wearing them, like I’m not actually being myself…

Hmm, I don’t have much experience with the type of jobs you get, so I can’t say that I completely understand, buuut…
What if you think about it the other way around? Like, what kinda outfits would you want? If it’s something you’d want, then you’d probably like wearing it, too.

Outfits I’d want…?
Ah—I was hoping to buy a sweater or shirt that has a mascot character on it sometime soon…♪

…That sounds more like comfy clothes for home to me. I doubt you can make use of it for your personal outfit.

H-How could you…!? This is the answer I get for the one time I come up with an idea!?

Now, now, settle down… I was thinking to myself, but…

…?

…?

What you heard was simply a rumor, correct? So it’s possible that you aren’t actually next in line.
Which means you may be worrying over nothing, and that would only be a waste of your time.
So how about you start by asking Anzu-dono if it’s true?


    Location: StarPro Office


(Shinobu-kun’s right. I’d only feel humiliated if I let a rumor make a fool of me, so I should double-check with Anzu-san first.)
(I heard she’s in the StarPro office…)
(Ah, there she is. She’s working near the window—)
……!?
(Our eyes met—Oh no, w-what do I do…!? She immediately got up from her seat to head over this way…!)
(Don’t tell me… She really is planning on talking to me about my personal outfit!?)
Hello, Anzu-san. Do you have something to talk to me about? Could it be my perso—
Huh? An event stage for a commercial products exhibition? What’s that about…?
…So you’re here to talk to me about that event ‘cause you’d like me to take part in it?
(She just wanted to talk to me about work, not my personal outfit… So it really was nothing but a rumor after all…?)
…Ah, sorry, did I look out of it to you…? Don’t worry, I was listening.
You said it’s an autumn commercial products exhibition, right? They’re gonna be selling veggies, fruits, and other specialties with a bunch of local mascot characters around.
What would you like me to do in that exhibition? You said something about a stage…


Huh!? I’ll be the host for a mascot character event…!?
—I’ll gladly do it! Anything to be near so many mascots!
I’ve been needing emotional healing for some time ‘cause I’ve been a bit depressed lately, and nothing could make me happier than getting my healing through mascots.
And my parents will be super happy to know I’ll be doing an advertisement for veggies and fruits. I’m looking forward to the exhibition…♪


    Location: ES Hallway


(She didn’t talk to me about my personal outfit in the end. Maybe it really was a rumor after all.)
(But huh, doing an event on stage… I bet it’d be pretty rowdy if all five of us in Ryuseitai hosted it together…)
(…Wait a sec, isn’t it kinda strange that only I got to hear about this? Is she gonna tell the rest of them later…?)
Ah, whatever. It sounds like I’m guaranteed to at least be around all sorts of mascots, sooo…
I’ll search up what kinda mascots will show up for the event…♪

Chapter 2

    Location: Park (Lawn Area)



    On the day of the exhibition

(Nobody from Ryuseitai is showing up…)
(None of them ever mentioned the exhibition either, and the pamphlet only had my name on it… I kinda had a small feeling about this, but—)
(This is a solo job, isn’t it…?)
(Ahh, what do I do… I was so excited for this, but now I’m starting to get nervous…)
(My usual solo jobs are photoshoots, and only my looks matter there… Which means I don’t really need to be good at talking…)
(But if I have to be the host of an event, then that also means I’m leading it, too… and even if I have a script for it, it doesn’t change the fact that I’ve gotta make sure I get the words out right…)
(—Can I really manage that…?)

Yoo, Takamine~? Woah, what’s wrong? Why do you look like you’re in despair?

Isara-senpai? Why’re you here?

Didn’tcha hear from Anzu? I’m gonna be taking part in the talk show for the exhibition.
You’re part of the mascot character event, right? Let’s do our best to hype this place up~♪
Haha, I can’t believe you’d get to be a host of all things~ But it is true that you love mascots, so I bet you can talk a lot about th—

……(Glares at Mao)

Why’re you looking at me with that terrifying look? Everything alright?

You’re making things harder for me… Why’re you putting so much pressure on me, huh…

I’m tryna say that I’m looking forward to your event, y’know! Here, you can have this merch I got, so cheer up~♪

T-That’s…!
The key strap of the local mascot that’s gonna show up in this exhibition—Alien Tomato…!?
Their name comes from their aggressive personality—for some reason they’ve chosen to invade all tomato-haters in hopes of making all of mankind love tomatoes—
Despite that, their face looks sooo lifeless and relatable, and the contrast is something to die for! Where did you get this strap from!?

A staff member gave it to me. Apparently it’s a limited merch from this exhibition. I took it with me ‘cause I figured you’d love it~♪
Also, you may have been nervous earlier, but you managed to talk to me all about this mascot at rapid speed, so I think you’ll be fine.

Huh? What do you mean…?

When you know a lot about something, it means you can talk a whole lot about it, right? And besides, you’ll be able to manage this through your love for mascots alone!
I’m cheering you on, so break a leg out there, Takamine~♪

Feels like you’re just throwing anything at me to cheer me up… But thank you anyway.


    Location: Event Stage


(…I managed to get on stage and all, but my heart’s still racing…)
(Calm down… breathe in, breathe out… It’ll be okay—I’m an idol, too. I’ll be able to deliver something to the audience, surely…)
“Hello, everyone…! I’m Takamine Midori, also known as Ryusei Green from Ryuseitai.”
“My teammates aren’t with me right now, so I’m feeling pretty nervous on my own here, but… I hope to make the place exciting with all the mascots here.”
“Alright, let’s start by introducing the mascots. First we have Alien Tomato, who—”
(Umm… Am I managing it okay…? I’m slipping up a bit here and there, but I’m talking just fine, right…?)
(I’m so glad I researched the mascots beforehand. Looking up about them made me love all of them, so I should be able to talk about their charms…!)
(And the audience is—)
Ah…
(I didn’t notice at first ‘cause I was struggling so hard to stay on foot, but I can see fans of mine in the crowd, looking at me with a fan in their hand…)
(Did they come to cheer for me…? Maybe I should wave at them, at least…)


“……♪”
(Ah, they look so happy. I’m so glad…)
(I’m not doing anything special on stage right now—I’m not saying or wearing anything cool, nor am I even performing something, but…)
(My fans are still happy to see me even without that, huh?)
(I can hear them telling me that I look cool, and cheering for me to do my best… I feel a bit embarrassed hearing that, but it’s giving me strength.)
(Huh, feeling more confident about yourself through the cheers of your fans is just like an idol, I think…)
(…Mhm, I’ll do my best here. I wanna make this a fun event, as best as I can.)
“Next up is… a mascot I’ve always loved, so I was super excited to meet them today. It’s Carrotian[1]…♪”


    Location: Park (Lawn Area)


Huh, Anzu-san…? Hello, I didn’t know you were here.
Oh, the event? Everyone enjoyed it, and I got a lot of praise for it… I feel like I was able to do the best I could.
The audience looked so happy in their seats… I feel a bit more confident with myself now, maybe…
—Ahhh, that reminds me. There’s something I wanted to ask you for a while—Is it true that I’m next to get a personal outfit?
Oh, you wanted to talk to me about that after the exhibition was over? Sigh, so that’s what it was…
Um, truth is, I tried thinking up an idea on my own when I caught news of it, but I couldn’t think of any ideas in my head…
I got pretty depressed about it after failing to come up with anything I’d like to wear…
But right now, I think I’ve got some sort of idea in my head. Could I speak to you about it?
…I think I’d like an outfit where I can be my typical self.


I don’t wanna look too cool… And by that, I mean I don’t wanna only show a cool side of me, and have everyone love me for that only… ‘Cause I’d hate to see them get disappointed the moment they see my true self.
That’s why… I think I’d want people to also love me for myself… That’s what I’d like to show in my personal outfit—Something that represents me.
So, umm… Basically, I feel like what I’d like to wear is an outfit that shows who I really am—
Will you please accept this request of mine? I’d love an outfit that lets me be in my most natural state…♪

    Season: Summer


    Location: Drink Stand


…♪

(…Sigh… I’m so exhausted… Everything hurts… I shouldn’t have done this when I’m barely used to it…)
(I was worried that I’d give up a week in, but I don’t think I can even get past the first day…)
(Well, whatever… I haven’t told anyone about this, anyway. Nobody’ll realize that I’ve failed… I can move on with my life…)

midori~

Ahhh!?
Shinkai-senpai, since when were you here…?

hmm, i wonder…? do you know, midori~?

Um, how should I know…? That’s why I asked you… What’re you doing here?
Wait, you’re clearly here to take a break if you’re just resting… I’m sorry for asking the obvious…

i think it’s a little different from that. i’m actually waiting for miss producer to arrive.
i can’t puka puka here since there isn’t much water, so i was drinking the juices from the drink stand to avoid drying up.
i could’ve just chosen the water, but i wanted to try out the other drinks they have while i’m here.
i recommend the orange soda. would you like to drink one, midori?

Um, okay. I guess I’ll drink it… May I sit next to you? As long as I’m not in your way…

of course you aren’t~ you and i are a close family, right? so come sit next to me~♪

Okay, then. (Sits down)

what have you been doing today, midori?

Me? Um… Crap, I wasn’t planning on mentioning it…

is it a secret? now i’m even more curious.

…It’s nothing big, really. Today’s my day off, so… I was exercising in the training room.

ah, work-outs, right? chiaki told me about it before. that’s very admirable of you, midori. good boy, gooood boy…♪

Um, it’s nothing to pat me on the head for, though… I lost motivation almost immediately…
I thought I had enough stamina from helping out at my home’s greengrocer, but…
Since I’m an idol now, it’d be best if I try and build my body to be better at maneuvering the way I want it to, so that my movements look much smoother, right?
That’s why I decided to work out… and I was planning on doing it starting today, but…
Once I actually tried it out, it was so much harder than I expected… I don’t think I can keep it up at all… I’m thinking of just quitting altogether…

bad boy…☆

Oww!! Why’d you flick my forehead!?

midori, it’s not good to give up so easily.
fishies all over the world have been around for four hundred million years. they did whatever they could to evolve—all for the sake of surviving in their world.
we as humans should learn from them.
so i’d like to see you work hard for another four hundred million years, too~♪

Four hundred million…? That’s insanely long…
But… you’re right. I shouldn’t quit on the very first day… I’ll try harder for a bit longer. Thank you, Shinkai-senpai.
Ah, wait, that’s right! Um, Shinkai-senpai! ……puka! ☆ (sideways peace)[1]

ummm…?

Huh? Ah, um… You don’t know this? …You didn’t get what I was going for?

midori, do you want to puka puka, too~?

Umm, no… I mean the aquarium. The mascot character Kanatee’s[2] catchphrase…

ahhh, i remember now. you’re right, that’s their catchphrase. i’m not used to it yet, so i didn’t notice~
…puka! ☆

Waaaah, I got to see “puka! ☆” from the person himself…! It’s so much better live than on video…♪
It’s been trending on social media, so I’ve been wanting to put all my attention on Kanatee and see the real thing for myself, but…
I’m insanely huge… so I’m worried I’d just get in the way of Kanatee if I went to visit them…
But I wanna see them so badly… Ugh, I’m so depressed… I wanna die…

hmm… then how about you help me with advertising for the aquarium?
kanatee’s role as a mascot is to promote aoumi aquarium, so—
if you were to advertise with them as an idol, you wouldn’t get in their way.

Advertising… That means I’ll get to see them all I want from up close!
I’ll do it. I’ll help you out in any way I can…♪

fufufu. thank you, midori~♪

No, thank you, Shinkai-senpai. When you didn&#39;t recognize my puka! ☆ imitation, I almost wanted to jump out the window from embarrassment, but…
In the end, you never know what’ll happen until you try, right? Ahaha…♪
By the way… does Kanatee have a signature? If they do, I’ll take with me a clear postcard for an autograph.

mmm… i never thought of a signature for them before.  …would fans of kanatee enjoy something like that?
fufu, i’ll practice signing one, then.
i think we’ll have a lot of fun promoting the aquarium with you around, midori. puka! ☆ (sideways peace)

    Season: Spring


    Location: Staff Cafeteria


Hellooo… This is the greengrocer, I hope you’ve all been doing well~…
(Huh…? There’s nobody around… Maybe I was a little too early… But I’d be late to school if I didn’t come here at around this hour…)
(Well, there’s nobody to scold me for being late, anyway…)
(Sigh… I can already imagine my next report card mentioning something about my lifestyle not being proper enough lately…)
(It’s all his fault… Thanks to that guy constantly spoiling me last year, I got used to that sort of treatment…)
…Woah—?
You surprised me… Hello, good morning, Miss Producer…
I’m sorry, I was in your way by standing at the door, wasn’t I…
I’ll move right away… Huff—Ahh, so heavy!
I haven’t bothered with my body beyond whatever nature gave me, but maybe I should start working out along with Tetora-kun and the others…
Hm? Ahh… You probably know this already, but my family owns a greengrocer, right…
That’s why lately, I’ve been bringing vegetables to this building, as well… ES was the name I think…
It’s a huge hassle… This place’s far from home…
I mean, I appreciate the cafeteria for buying so many, but carrying them is a major pain…
And then I feel extremely exhausted straight from the morning, and start yawning all day… Well, okay, I was always the type to do that, but…
Ahhh, jeez… This is too draining, ugh—I don’t wanna do this anymore… I’m so depressed, I wanna die…
Woah—! Ahh no, you don’t have to help me carry these…
I appreciate the thought, but I don’t think I should let a woman do the lifting…
I may be saying how depressed I am and all, but I just have a habit of saying that, so don’t worry…
I’d only be a failure of a hero if I keep letting others help me…
Actually… I know I’m late in asking, but why are you here so early in the morning?
Don’t you have school, too…?
Huh, I see… So it’s part of the Producer Course’s curriculum to adjust class times to your jobs, so you’ve got school off on a weekday…?
Your course sorta sounds like a pain…
Well, I guess it’s harsh in the Idol Course, too—We have to study during the day, and then go to work after classes…
Huh, I guess it’s rough all around… I only joined the Idol Course by accident, but…
I’m sure I would’ve been sighing about how depressed I was no matter what I went into…
If that’s the case… I won’t bother with a re-do when I’m this far into my course, and it would be unforgivable on the behalf of everyone who’s helped me anyway, so…
I’ve just gotta do what I can with what I have now.
Hehe. I’ve finally gotten used to life as an idol student, and, well…
I’m definitely not as overwhelmed as I was when I first joined the course, so don’t worry about me…
Well… I’ve still got a whole bunch of worries, though…
Just the other day, there was some news about a “super handsome greengrocer guy!”, and now I’m getting more jobs related to my looks…
But man, I’m already having to deal with taking over the greengrocer, ‘cause my dad’s health has declined…
Honestly, I feel like I’m holding vegetables way more often than a microphone…
Like, I’m having more jobs to do relating to supporting food businesses and other farmhouses… Stuff related to partnerships, and all…
I mean, I’m glad to know that even someone like me could be of use to people, but…
Lately, my “greengrocer guy” side is way more obvious than the fact that I’m a hero or an idol…
Like, I won’t be someone protecting the world, but a protector of vegetables and fields…
My parents would be happy, but, I dunno… I feel like no matter what I do, or how hard I try turning things around…
I’ll always go back to just being a greengrocer guy, huh…
I feel like I haven’t been able to move one bit since I was born, and it’s making me kinda anxious…
But, honestly… I dunno what I wanna be, or even what I can be… I only have a vague idea…
I’ve always just gone with the flow, so I don’t really have a clear idea of what my dream is…
It’s only a coincidence I became an idol, too… And I only became a hero because there was someone who wanted me to…
That’s why… I feel like I haven’t really been walking with my own feet…
I’m just in the same place as I was when I was first born—within a cabbage.
Ah—No, it’s not that I think babies are born from cabbages…
My parents tricked me into thinking that when I was young, but I know better now, really…
Uh—I suppose this isn’t the topic to talk to with a woman, or it’d just sound like sexual harassment… Uuu~ I’m sorry.
Actually, I’m also sorry for complaining this much… I’m a second year now—a senior, so I’ve gotta pull myself together…
(Breathe in, breathe out)
The green flames are the mark of compassion!
The great nature, growing infinitely! Ryusei Green, Takamine Midori!
Ahaha… I feel better whenever I say this, like I’ve really transformed into a hero…
The real me has no proper footing, and is super uncool, but… I hope I could grow infinitely, just like my catch phrase—even if it’ll take a while…
And that’s how I’ll be doing my best, so… Please do support me, Miss Producer…♪

    Season: Summer


    Location: Garden


Here we go, heave-ho… Haah, I think that’s enough fertilizer? Just preparing the tools has drained me, I wanna go home…
This may be part of my club activities, but it’s all optional, so it wouldn’t make anyone angry if I just went home…
But tiding everything when I just took the effort to set things up would be pointless… I’ll try to work hard for a little, maybe…?
Maybe I could cheer myself with a “hip-hip, hurray! ♪”……
(Nope, that was emptier than I thought… Seriously, what am I doing talking to myself… We’re just gardening here, y’know…)
(No one saw me, right? If someone did I’d die from embarrassment… Gotta be quiet—just do everything quietly….)
(I guess I’ll start with getting rid of weeds… Hmm, the roots seem pretty deep down… I don’t think I can pull them out that easily…)
(I always pull them by hand, but maybe I should try out the weed puller for the first time…?)
(I know how to use it… I should, at least. I’ve seen other people use it…)
(But what if I accidentally break it…? No, I just need to pull the root up, so… Yeah, it’ll be okay…)
…Ohhh!
(Wow, this is so much fun…♪ I can pull them out without even trying.)
(Wait, how can it be this easy? Why have I been pulling them with just my hands this whole time… I’m so depressed…)
(W-Well, anyway, getting back on track… Let’s get rid of the rest.)
(Grab the root, and pull…)
(Ahh, feels so good. I didn’t expect this to be so soothing…♪)
♪~♪~♪
… Ahaha, I’m having so much fun that I’ve started humming. Being able to do work at my own pace is so nice… Ahh, this is the very essence of peace…

Oh-oh! Is that you, Midori-kun!?

Wha—!? Shinobu-kun?
Wait, don’t tell me you heard me humming… So depressing…

Why are you holding your head, Midori-kun?
No, never mind that!
I beg you! Please hide me somewhere!

Hide…? Did you do something…? Did you hit Kunugi-sensei’s glasses with a shuriken or…?

That would take some high level skill to properly perform. I hope to be able to throw a shuriken that accurately someday…♪
No, wait—This isn’t the time! Is there any place I can hide!? Ahh, I must hide now, or the pursuer will…!!

Um. I dunno what’s going on, but you wanna hide somewhere, right? How about I try hiding you with this blue tarp…
Could you sit in front of this planter?

Got it~

Now I’ll put this tarp on you, and…

Midori-kun, Midori-kun! Am I concealed?

U-Uh-huh… Nobody will noti—
(Nope, he’ll be spotted instantly. The shape looks so weird, it’s clearly suspicious…)
—! I hear footsteps. It sounds like they’re coming closer…

Uwawa—It’s definitely the pursuer!

(W-What do I do… At this point, I’ve just gotta be a wall to hide the tarp from sight…!)
(Please, don’t notice anything…!)

Hmmm… Is there anyone here?

(That voice… It sounds like either Yuta-kun or Hinata-kun… I can’t move right now, so I can’t check which twin it is…)

This really felt like a good place for one of them to hide in, though… Oh well, I’ll look somewhere else.

(… Whew, seems like he gave up.)
… Shinobu-kun, I think it’s okay to come out now.

Really…?
Whew—I’m so glad! I escaped a fatal crisis…♪

You kept saying “pursuer”, so I thought it was way more serious, y’know…?

You see, the Asobi club is currently playing tag within the whole ES building.
We have only one rule: Play tag in a gentlemanly way, without bothering anyone…☆

Mmm… I don’t think gentlemen play tag, though…?

Urm, your retort was right on the dot… I apologize for disturbing you while you were working.

Well, I was only working in silence anyway, so… Don’t worry about it.

I realized this once you put the tarp over me, but were you tending the plants?
Yuta-kun is “it” right now, but I don’t think he will be back for a while, so I shall help you out.
Pretending to be a gardener to conceal myself feels spy-like~♪

I’m only doing it for myself, so you don’t have to… But sure, why not… Okay, then how about you get rid of the weeds from that planter…?

Understood! I shall pour my heart into extracting them~♪

It’s only weeds, so I don’t think you’ll need to do that…
Asobi club… If I remember clearly, you guys literally just play around together?
It has all kinds of people from different units in it… It does sound sorta fun…

Wooah~! Are you perhaps secretly interested in joining us, Midori-kun!?
Harukawa-kun, Yuta-kun, and Sazanami-dono are all in it—It’s quite fun~♪

Ah, sorry, but no thanks… I do think it sounds fun, but I doubt I could keep up with any of you…
Gardening fits me way better, I think…

Oh, alright. That’s a bit of a shame~
If you ever felt like joining, please do inform me. The club will always be happy to welcome you~♪

    Season: Summer


    Location: Staff Cafeteria


I’m hungry… It’s a little too early for lunch, but I’ll have something to eat anyway.
(Hmm… It’s pretty empty around this hour, I didn’t know that. I can’t really calm down in a crowded place, since it’s always so noisy… I’m glad I found out about this.)
(Usually most meals are sold out if you’re a second too late, but it seems like I can choose any of them right now.)
(So there’s two types of prepared meals today, huh… There’s A for a steak dish and B for cutlet curry rice. You can have a refill of cabbages for A, and rice for B…)
(Hmm, which to choose…)

Takamine-kun, hello~♪

Ah… Shino-kun, are you here for lunch, too?

I am. I finished work early today, so I tried coming here early, too.
Waah, we can choose whatever we like~
I always freeze up when this place is crowded because it’s hard to order anything, and then the meals sell out before I get my chance to speak. I feel like I’m at an advantage this time~♪

Hehe, you’re reacting the same way I did…

Really? That’s kinda embarrassing, ehehe… But I’m happy to know we have something in common.
The value meals must be the prepared meals, right? They’re cheap and come with a dessert, so…
Steak or cutlet curry rice… Which to choose, hmm…

(He’s stuck on the same choices as me. Yeah, I get you, it’s hard to let go of either…)
(Maybe I should just go ahead and order both…?)
(Both… Ah, I know.)
Um, Shino-kun…

Yes, what is it?

Erm… You don’t have to if you don’t want to, but… I’m also stuck on which to choose, and, well… I was wondering if you’re okay with splitting the meals between us?

Waaah, is that really fine with you!? I would love to~♪
Ehehe. I split meals with Tomoya-kun sometimes, so I’m really happy to know I can do the same with you, too~♪

Ahaha, I didn’t expect you to get so happy about it. I’m so glad I asked…♪
Okay then… I’ll buy the steak dish, and you can buy the cutlet curry rice… Is that okay with you?

Yes, let’s do it~♪

Time to eat…

Yes, let’s dig in…♪

(munch, munch)… Mm… The steak’s thick and juicy, and tastes even better with rice. I can eat this for years…♪

The cutlet curry is delicious too thanks to the tasty sauce~
Here, Takamine-kun. Say “ahh~” ♪

Huh… Huh!?

We promised to split the meals, right? C’mon, “ahh~”…♪

Mm… (munch, munch)

Does it taste good?

I-It’s tasty, but… I’m kinda confused why I just got fed with an “ahh”…

Ah—I’m sorry! I have a habit of doing this at home, because I always do it to my siblings…

I see… Um, you’ll be eating the steak, too, right?
I cut it in half, so… Here you go, I’ll put it on your plate like this…

Thank you~♪ (munch, munch)… This is delicious too~
Ehehe, it was a good idea to split our meals.
Takamine-kun, thank you for eating lunch with me.
This cafeteria is quite fancy, so I feel awkward eating in it alone… I’m so glad you were here~♪

(He’s thanking me for something so simple… He really is such a good, proper kid…)
I’m glad I got to see you too, it was just perfect timing… If I were on my own, I wouldn’t have been able to choose, and would’ve just bought both…

Both!? You can eat that much!?

I did a lot of work this morning that used up most of my energy, so I was really hungry… I think I would’ve been able to eat both if I tried.

I-I see. I’m sure it would have been impossible for me… But I suppose I should also try harder to eat more, so I can grow big…

You don’t need to push yourself, y’know? Everyone has a certain amount of food their stomach can handle…
Grow big though, huh… I wonder how you’d look if you were bigger…? Maybe you’d go from being a cute idol to a cool idol.
Hmmm, I can’t imagine it…

Hehe, it sounds fun to be a cool idol. And in your case, if you were as small as me—
You would’ve been an adorable idol~♪

Mmm, I wonder… If I was small, I might’ve not been able to continue being an idol, let alone be one in Ryuseitai.
I feel like, heroes look a lot cooler when they’re tall, and, well—
If I don’t at least have some masculinity like Tetora-kun, then I could never manage to compensate for the lack of it with good reflexes, like Shinobu-kun does.
So, I think my current size is just fine…♪

With Kaoru
Location: Classroom 3-A

Hmhmhm~ Hmhmhmmm~♪

You’re in a good mood, Morisawa-kun~ Did something nice happen to you?

Fuhahaha! I’m glad you asked, Hakaze!

No, no, you clearly looked like you were waiting for someone to ask. Like, unbearably so.

Mhm! My bad! You see, my favorite tokusatsu show is going to have a movie!
I wanted to share this wonderful news with someone, so I ended up humming for attention!

Mm… Couldn’t you just share that kinda stuff with someone who also likes tokusatsu? I don’t have any interest in it, y’know~?

True, I could’ve, but I really couldn’t hold back my urge to tell someone!
If anything nice happens to you, feel free to tell me all about it! Even if I don’t know anything about the topic, I’ll be happy about it with you…☆

Ahaha~ Thanks. I think it’s nice that you’re that type of person, yeah~

Ooh! Thank you! Let’s hang out, Hakaze! We’ll watch the movie together once it comes out!

Yeah, no thanks. No way I’ll ever go to a movie with a guy~♪

With Tetora
Location: Park

The red flames are the mark of justice! Burning bright red, the sun of life! Ryusei Red! Morisawa Chiaki…!
You say yours too, Nagumo! …Ah! Did you forget it by any chance? Alright then, I’ll say it right now, so make sure to remember it!
The black flames are the mark of effort! The burning fighting spirit, stained with the soil of the earth! Ryusei Black! Nagumo Tetora…!

Umm… Taichou? Sorry for asking while you’re so excited, but… Couldja tell me why you called us here?
You told us to come over here after class, but I only see the two of us in this park…

Mhm, I’ve no idea where Kanata is, but Sengoku said he’d come, so he should be here soon.
The reason I called you all here is so we could perform a hero show. And also to practice our catchphrases!

Ahh, right, you want us to gather a crowd of kids again. But before I came here, Midori-kun told me somethin’ during class…
He said he won’t be able to come &#39;cuz he has to work at his family’s greengrocer.

Hold on, I wasn’t informed about this…? This means that me, you, and Sengoku are the only ones who’ll perform.
Well, no matter. Hardships are an inevitability for heroes! By overcoming them, you become qualified to call yourself one!
Oh! Here comes Sengoku. And the children are here, too. Now that we have our guests, we should start our hero show!

With Shu
Location: Handicrafts Clubroom

Itsuki, are you in here…!?

Non! Knock before you come in!

Sorry, sorry. The thing is, I&#39;ve been looking for you because I have something to ask of you.

Something to ask of me…? Hmph, this isn’t going to be something frivolous, is it?

No, see… One of the Ryuseitai uniforms has started to come apart. Could you fix it for me, please?

I heard your uniforms were made by Kiryu. Shouldn’t you ask him, instead?

I’d love to, but… He wasn’t in the dojo, nor in his classroom… I think he’s gone home.
We have a hero show planned for tomorrow, so I need it fixed as soon as possible…
I’ll pay you, of course. I know I’m asking for a lot, but could you fix it by today? Please! I’m begging you!

Raise your head. You’d probably remain here until I say yes, and that would cause me far more trouble. I will agree only this once.

Ohh, you’ll do it? Thank you, Itsuki! It’s so wonderful to have such kind classmates! ♪

With Midori
Location: Classroom 1-A

Takamine-kun, let’s go to the club!

Huh…? Um, sorry, who are you again…?

What!? Did you forget who I am, Takamine!? I’m the burning heart Morisawa Chiaki! I’m Ryuseitai’s leader, and the captain of the Basketball Club! ☆

Ah—So it was you… Ughh~ Don’t call me by “Takamine-kun” out of nowhere… It’s super weird…
Like, what happened to you…? Did you hit your head or something…?

Heheh, you see, you kept saying how you hated me being overbearing!
So I thought you may feel otherwise if I tried to be more charming![1]
And so! Takamine-kun! Let’s go to the club! Let&#39;s shed the sweat of youth…☆

Ughh… You’re still coming right up into my personal space, so nothing’s actually changed, y’know…?

Huh!? So it didn’t work!? Mrrm, it’s hard to be charming!!
Nevertheless! We have practice today, so come join us, Takamine!

Ughh… You’ll drag me along with you no matter how many times I say no, won’t you…?
Meh, fine… I don’t have any work at the greengrocer’s today, and I have the time to spare…

Ohh!? Really!? I’m so happy to hear that, Takamine~♪
Alright! This is a great time to invite Akehoshi and the others over, as well! Fuhahaha! ☆

With Kanata
Location: Fountain

Hmhmhmm…♪

fufufu…♪ fufufufufu…♪

Woah—!? You surprised me, Kanata! You&#39;re bathing in the fountain again?

yes~ water is my life force, after all.
would you like to join me, chiaki? the water is so cold and nice~♪

I&#39;m reading a book right now, so I&#39;d rather refrain from doing so.

book…? what kind of book are you reading?

Ohh!? Are you interested, Kanata!? It&#39;s a book that features every sentai hero in history! It&#39;s a precious treasure of mine~♪

mm~ not interested.

Why not!? Were we not brethren who share the same goal!? I believe in you, Kanata! I&#39;m sure there&#39;s a part of you deep inside that admires heroes!

i don&#39;t really know what to say to that, you know… i still don&#39;t understand heroes that well.
but, i want to learn more about them. chiaki, could you read that book for me, please?

I don&#39;t mind, but I may as well lend it to you. It&#39;s my own copy, so you can return it to me anytime!

um… books get drenched wet whenever i read them, so…
i don&#39;t want to ruin your precious book. please do read it for me instead, chiaki.

Ohh, right, since you&#39;re always soaking with water… Very well then, I&#39;ll read it out loud to you!
Alright, let&#39;s have a fun reading session together~! Fuhahahahaha…!! ☆

With Keito
Location: Classroom 3-A

Bam! The hero has arrived…☆
Heh! Fear not, for I am here! I&#39;ll defeat all the evil in one swipe…☆

…What on earth are you doing, Morisawa.

Woah, Hasumi—!? Since when were you behind me…?

I was never once behind you, you were simply messing around in front of the classroom door.
Anyway, what were you doing?

Mm, do you know about the toku broadcasted on Sunday mornings? I was re-enacting a hero scene from the show!

Toku…? Ahh, you mean the hero shows, huh. Yeah, I&#39;ve watched one before.

Wha—Really!? Are you interested in hero shows by any chance!?

Sorry to burst your bubble, but I just happened to come across an episode one day when I turned the TV on.
Although, I do think it&#39;s pretty excellent for a children&#39;s show.
I forgot which series this was, but… I remember an episode where someone close to the protagonist fell ill to a chronic disease, and he had the opportunity to save them if he joined sides with the villains.
His close friend helped him time and time again, so he wanted to save them at any cost, but he knew they wouldn&#39;t forgive him for tainting his own hands for their sake.
In the end, after agonizing over what to do, he chose to be a hero… I found that very inspiring.

Ohh, I know that one! I&#39;ve watched it plenty of times myself!
Wow, so even you&#39;ve watched it, Hasumi!? I&#39;m so happy~! We still have time before class starts, so let&#39;s talk about it a little more!
Ahhh, today&#39;s off to a wonderful start…☆

With Chiaki
Location: Gym

Please excuse meee~…

Hm? Ohhh, would you like to use the gym? Sorry! The Basketball Club reserved the spot for this hour!
However, you&#39;re free to use the unreserved space over on that side!

Ahh, no, I&#39;m just here to pick up something I forgot.
Um, there&#39;s only you here, though. Where are the rest of the club members?

Oh, I actually came here a little earlier than the appointed time.
Nobody&#39;s here yet. But I figured I could use my spare time playing basketball by myself!

Huh, I see… Oh! Did this fall out of the ball basket? Oh well, here goes nothing—Aaand shoot…! ☆

Ohhh~! Wow, you shot the goal perfectly! Do you have experience in basketball by any chance!?

Ahaha, I just got lucky! I felt like I could make the shot from my spot, is all.

That&#39;s still amazing, y&#39;know!? You might have what it takes to become a basketball player!
Ermm… Would you mind practicing with me until the rest of my club members arrive? Only if you&#39;re alright with it, of course!

Ah, sure! I don&#39;t really have anything to do right now, so I may as well~♪
Heh… I dunno if I&#39;ll ever get another chance to play with the basketball captain himself, so I&#39;m gonna go all out. Please make sure to prepare yourself~♪

With Midori
Location: Entrance

(I don&#39;t have any unit or club activities for the day, so I can go home straight away…)
(And my parents told me I don&#39;t have to help out today, so I finally have a day for myself…♪)

Heeey, Midori-kun!

Eep—! Huh, Aoi-kun? W-What&#39;s wrong…? Why&#39;re you out of breath…?

Oh, nah, nothing bad happened. Anyway, you free right now, Midori-kun?

No, I&#39;m not… I have something to do…

Oh, okay… I wanted you to come with me somewhere if you had the time to spare, but oh well…

(Uu… He looks so down…)
(Maybe I shouldn&#39;t have lied to him… Uuu~ I won&#39;t be able to sleep through the guilt if I go home now…)
Um, Aoi-kun… I know I said I had something to do just a second ago, but I can leave it for later, so… I could at least hear you out…

Woah, really!? Thanks~ I&#39;m so glad to have such a kind classmate! ♪
Right, so—Yuuta-kun and I were planning to go to a live show together, but he won&#39;t be able to make it anymore &#39;cause something came up outta nowhere.
I couldn&#39;t get anyone else to join me either, &#39;cause they&#39;ve all got things to do…
I could just go on my own, but I&#39;d be wasting a ticket, so I wanted to try finding someone to go with.
So, Midori-kun! Come with me to the live show! Please

Whaa…? I just said I&#39;d only hear you out…

So it&#39;s a no-go…? There isn&#39;t much time left &#39;til it starts, though! You&#39;re the only one I can count on at this point~!

Uuu… I guess it&#39;d be a shame to let that ticket go to waste… But I&#39;m only making an exception this once, okay…?

Thanks a bunch~! Mhm, mhm, I&#39;m so glad I have such a kind guy for a classmate~♪

Oh! Sena! Good mooorning!

You&#39;re sooo loud early in the morning, Morisawa.  …Is nobody here yet?

Not yet! I had class duty today, so I came much earlier!
Do you always come to school this early? That&#39;s incredible, I respect you…☆

It&#39;s not that incredible… Besides, I&#39;m actually way later than usual &#39;cause they had that newbie on duty in the idol course reception, and they took forever to let me in.

Oh yeah, there&#39;s been a new receptionist on duty this year, huh?
But that&#39;s strange, I was allowed inside pretty easily.

Yeah, well, I was with the new kid. I can&#39;t believe that receptionist made the same mistake again after the thorough lecture I gave them before!
This is their job, they shouldn&#39;t be forgetting what to do every second.
I scolded them again to do a better job next time, but I might just report to their boss if they forget what to do again.

Hmm, you were late because of the newcomer, but you don&#39;t seem all that angry to me.
In fact, you look pretty happy!

I love picking on newbies and juniors, after all~
I had a lot of fun telling them off, so I can&#39;t deny that I&#39;m happy~♪

puka, puka…♪ the salty wind feels so nice~♪

one, two, one two…

oh, tetora? are you taking a walk near the beach, too?

Ah, Shinkai-senpai! Wassup~!
I&#39;m training my body by jogging! &#39;Cuz working out&#39;s my hobby! Heh!

you&#39;re working out~? walking near the beach would be my hobby.
it&#39;s good to work out with jogging, but how about taking it easy with a walk every once in a while?
the salty breeze feels nice, and you get to enjoy the romantic view of the sea turning red~♪

Ahh, it&#39;s almost sunset by now, huh?
You&#39;re right, it&#39;d be a waste not to take in this view! Aighty, I&#39;ll take a walk around here &#39;til the sun sets~♪

yes, that sounds good~ we still have so much more to go in our lives, after all.
there&#39;s no need to rush to the finish line, so let&#39;s take it easy~♪

With Chiaki
Location: Downtown

(…Right, I bought everything I need; time to head back to school.)

Oh! Is that you, Kiryu!? What’s up, what were you doing? Were you shopping?

Ooh, Morisawa. I was just done buyin’ a knitting needle and some wool from the handicrafts store.

Are you going to knit something? My mother sometimes knits on her days off, too—she tried making me wear the sweater she made once.
But there was a huge heart knitted right in the middle, and it was honestly too embarrassing for me to wear… So I gave it to my dad instead.

That so? Haha, ain’t that nice—You get on well with your family~♪
I was also thinkin’ of knittin’ a plushie for my fami—my li’l sis, actually, so I bought some materials for that, too.
Sounds like it’s become a fad to have a knitted plushie at her school, so I figured it’d be too cruel for her to be the only one without one.

Mhm, mhm! Your little sister is so fortunate to have such a wonderful big brother!

Haha, ya really think a brother like me is fortunate to have~?
But well, I do plan to do whatever I can for her to feel that way about me.

Ohhh? Mitsuru-saaaan! What’s up, hm? Do you need to go to the staff office?
Aaalrighty then! Mama’s coming with you! It’ll be like a parent-teacher conference, and this way, you won’t have to feel nervous going in alone! ☆

Uurgh~ It’s got nothing to do with you, Buchou-dude… Also, I’m not feeling nervous.

That sooo! Sorry, sorry, I guess you’re just here by chance.

Um, not really. I do have to go in there, &#39;cuz like, I got scolded by Akiomi-sensei just now.

Ahhh, so you’re feeling down, not nervous. Mhm, mhm, it sucks to be scolded by a teacher, doesn’t it!
Do you like onigiri, Mitsuru-san? I got okaka onigiri and umeboshi onigiri with me! I’ll give you whicheeever you prefer! If you like both, then I’ll give you both…♪

Huh? Onigiri? I don’t like umeboshi, it’s too salty~ I guess I’d prefer the okaka one?

Okaka it is, then! I’ll eat the umeboshi! Time for a snaaack~☆

Wait, wait! The teachers’ll scold you for eating here! I don’t get you anyway! Why’re you suddenly asking me if I like onigiri?

Ahh, that&#39;s &#39;cause I looove onigiri! And eating your favorite food will cheer you riiight up! Though, onigiri isn’t your favorite, is it…
I’ll go buy you your favorite food! Eat it and cheer up! Smile! Fortune comes to those who smiiile! Hahahaha!! ☆

With Chiaki
Location: Classroom 3-A

Oh, if it isn&#39;t Chiaki-san! Good mooooorniiiiiing…☆

Ahh, Mikejima-san… Good morning, I see you&#39;re energetic as always.

Mmm~? You don&#39;t seem as energetic, though. What&#39;s wrong, something happen? I&#39;ll help you out if you need it!

Nothing happened, it&#39;s just… I&#39;m feeling kind of depressed about our upcoming math class.
I know nothing will come out of being down, but I can&#39;t get myself back into the swing of things…

Ohh, reaaally? I thought you&#39;d be good at math since you&#39;re such a hard worker. Guess I was wrong, huh?

Ahaha, I&#39;m actually really bad at it, so I always make sure to study as much as possible.
We have a math quiz today, so I stayed up late last night studying.
But instead of giving me a confidence boost, all it did was make me feel light-headed from the lack of sleep…

Mmm…? It&#39;s just a quiz, riiight? You don&#39;t need to overthink it.
Hm, buuut if it&#39;ll help you out, we could study a bit together? There might be something I could teach you to prep you up!

R-Really? You&#39;d be okay with that!? Thank you so much, Mikejima-san!

Hahaha, &#39;course! I&#39;ll aaalways help out a person in need!
Aaalrighty then, let&#39;s get to it! We&#39;ve got this, Chiaki-san…♪

With Midori
Location: Shopping District

Oh, Takamine? Nice seeing you here! Are you here to do shopping, too?

No… I live here… Actually, you&#39;re right in front of my house…

Oh, you&#39;re right, it says &quot;Takamine&#39;s Greengrocer&quot;. Wow, so this is your home, huh… Hmm… I may as well buy something from you, then!
What do you recommend I get, Takamine? Oh, and if you give me a recipe or two that uses veggies, I should be able to make &#39;em at home by myself.

Um, I can&#39;t answer that on the spot… But the veggies you see at the front are the seasonal ones…
Wait a sec, Isara-senpai, you make your own food…? Do you live by yourself…?

Nah, I live with my family, but I grew up living my life independently, &#39;cause my parents think I should be able to cook and do stuff on my own.
I keep making myself instant noodles, though. But since that&#39;s not a healthy diet, I figured it&#39;s about time I start eating more veggies.
I&#39;ll only make enough for myself, so I don&#39;t need that many ingredients… But hey, if I ever make too much food, I could carry a lunch box to school for once.

Wow, you&#39;re already so busy with work, but you even cook for yourself…? That&#39;s amazing…
Umm, Isara-senpai, I think we overstocked the vegetables in the back, so we could sell them to you for cheap…

Woah, for real!? I&#39;d love that~! Thanks a bunch, Takamine. Guess I&#39;m having a veggie-filled dinner tonight~♪

With Chiaki
Location: Entrance

Sigh… I thought I’d have today off since there are no unit activities, but now I found out that there’s club practice instead…
I could tolerate it if this was planned beforehand, but being told about it only now makes it so much worse…
I don’t even feel like doing anything… What do I do… Should I just take the day off…?

Hold it, Takamine! You shouldn’t skip! I overheard what you said just now, and as your club captain I’m obliged to advise you to do otherwise!

Urghh… The most bothersome guy just had to hear me talking to myself… This is so depressing, I wanna die…

If you have no motivation, then you just need to find some! I’ll do whatever it takes to pump motivation back into you!

Don’t just blabber anything out of your mouth… If I could just “find some,” then I wouldn’t be suffering this much…

There’s plenty of ways to feel motivated, y’know? Like, getting yourself hyped up with adrenaline…

Adrenaline…? How would I go about doing that…?

One way would be to put yourself in a life-threatening situation, but we can’t conduct anything dangerous, so…
An easier, faster way would be to work out! And so, without further ado, let’s head to the gym and play basketball!

…? I can’t keep up with you… Aren’t you just saying something extremely dumb…?
Ahh, I can’t take it anymore… Everything is such a damn pain… Can someone please talk some sense into this guy…

With Kanata
Content Warning: Casual suicide and drowning mention.

Location: Fountain

I’m so depressed… I wanna die… I’m depressed enough to try and drown myself in this fountain…

puka, puka…♪ oh, midori…? hello~ have you also come to bathe?

Woah—Something came out the water…! Um, Shinkai-senpai? What’re you doing in there?

hehehe, i’m bathing, of course~ it feels so nice to be soaked in water…♪

Uhh, okay… It’s too weird for me to actually understand, though.
Um, I shouldn’t be interrupting you, so… I’m gonna leave…

wait a moment, midori. you’re my one hundredth guest, so.
as celebration, i would like to give you this macropinna plush toy~♪

Gwah!? Please don’t shove something in my face out of nowhere… I was this close to actually suffocating to death…
And what do you mean by one hundredth…? Were there that many depressed people like me…?

i’m sorry. i’ve only been counting the people who’ve come to the fountain while i’m bathing… i don’t know if they were depressed.
never mind that. here you go~ please give them lots of love…♪

Eh, I guess I’ll take it… Hm? Wait, this looks similar to my favorite mascot character…
Thank you, Shinkai-senpai! I’m feeling so much better now!

With Hajime
Location: Shopping District

Sigh… Welcome…

Hehe, Takamine-kun, hello~♪

Ah, Shino-kun… You came to shop here again…♪

Yes~! Your home’s vegetables are very delicious. But I feel a bit bad that you sell them so cheap for me.

Don&#39;t worry, the ones out of shape have lost value, that’s all.
We can’t really sell them anymore, so you’re actually helping us out a lot…

Oh no no, it’s fine. They’re still just as delicious. Hehe, my family really enjoyed the tomatoes you gave me the other day, too~♪ They said they were sweet and tasty~

Ah, we have some nice stuff for sale today, too… Also, as thanks for being our regular customer, I’ll give you some cucumbers as extra, okay…?

Waaah, are you sure that’s okay? Thank you very much! This is such a lifesaver~♪

Hehe… Please come again to Takamine’s Greengrocer…♪

With Tetora
Location: Gym

Sigh… Playing basketball is so depressing, I wanna die…

Midori-kun, do it properly! C’mon, you’ve got the ball now, so take the shot!

Whaaa… I’m too far from the goal to do that…
But it’s also a pain to try and dribble past everyone until I’m closer… I’m just gonna pass it to you, so you do the rest…

Like I just said! Do it properly! All we’ve been doing so far is passing the ball back and forth to each other; it’s not real practice!
Mrrm… I’ve been kinda wondering for a while, but… Do you dislike basketball?

I don’t dislike it, but I don’t love it, either…
Why do I have to play basketball in my club and during class, too… Sigh… I wanna die…

Jeez, you gotta stop saying that all the time!
But, to be fair, if you aren’t interested in something, you’re not gonna like it no matter how much you do it, so… Let’s do some passing drills over there, instead.

Huh? You sure…? I’d honestly rather just huddle myself deep into a corner, though…?

Yeah, uh, I don’t think that’s a good idea. Try to hold on &#39;til class is over and practice with me a li&#39;l, please.

Ahaha…… You look like the one who’s trying to hold on, though… You probably wanted to practice together with everyone, huh…
Thank you. I get to take it easy now, so… you’re really helping me out…♪

With Shinobu
Location: Library

(Phew… It&#39;s so relaxing in the library…)
(It&#39;s so quiet in here, it makes me feel at peace… I just love how I can sit here and do nothing but stare into space…♪)

Oh, Midori-kun? Are you here to borrow a book, too?

Woah, Sengoku-kun…? Sorry, I was so out of it that I didn&#39;t notice you came in here.
Yeah, I felt like borrowing a book to kill time… &#39;Cause I way prefer reading at home than moving my body…♪

Me too~! I&#39;m an indoor ninja, after all~♪
What genres do you usually read, Midori-kun?

I don&#39;t have any specific one I like… I tend to read books I feel like I could relate to, I guess…?
What about you, Sengoku-kun…?

I&#39;m fascinated by animal biology, so I plan to borrow a book all about frogs~♪

Ahh, you did mention that you own pet frogs…
Mmm… Frog-themed mascots are cute, but I don&#39;t think I&#39;d vibe with the real thing…
I could see the small ones being cute, but there&#39;s no way I can handle the big ones… I&#39;d be too terrified to touch them…

Hehe, it simply takes time getting used to~! You&#39;ll find that the bigger ones are just as cute~♪
Look at this photo, Midori-kun! These two here are Peachy and Thunder~♪ Aren&#39;t they adorable?

Huh? Um, I guess…?
I&#39;ll show you pictures of my favorite mascots, too. I know for a fact that you&#39;ll feel soothed by how adorable they are…♪

With Yuta
Location: Hallway

Hmhmhmmm~…♪

Oh? Midori-kun! You sound like you&#39;re in a good mood~ Did something nice happen to you?

Mm…? Aoi-kun…? Mhm, the transfer student made me a mascot…♪

Mascot…? Ahh, the one on your bag?
Huh… So you like this kind of stuff?

Mhm… Looking at mascots soothes my soul… But most of all, they give me a reason to live…♪

I don&#39;t really get what you mean by the latter, but I can see how they can be soothing. I feel at ease just looking at it.
Hm… Would the transfer student make me one too if I asked?

Yeah, I&#39;m sure she&#39;d gladly make you one…
She&#39;s told me that it&#39;s the perfect way to practice her sewing, and that I could request new ones anytime…
Ah—If you ever ask her to make you one, could you show it to me, too…?
All her hand-made mascots are super cute, so I&#39;d love to look at them for comfort…♪

Ahaha, sure. It&#39;s pretty rare to see you so eager to talk, Midori-kun!
That just shows how much you love mascots~ Mhm, mhm! It sure is wonderful to have things you love~♪

True… I always get back my will to live whenever I see mascots, no matter how depressed I get…
So maybe it really is nice to have something you love…♪

With Mitsuru

Mitsuru-saaaaan! It’s only the two of us in the club today! Nooow then! What should we do~?

I don’t wanna do anything.

What’s wrong, what’s wrooong! What’s with the grumpy mood?

I came to the club today so I could compete with Ado-chan-senpai…

Ohhh. But something came up, so he couldn&#39;t come over, y’knooow? He said he’ll make sure to make it up to you, didn’t he?

I wanted to do runs with him today. I was looking forward to this for sooo long…

Heheh. That’s cute, you’re sulking…♪ You’ll make Adonis-san feel bad if you say that, yeah?

Uurgh… That would suck…

Then cheeeer up! Mama will run with you in Adonis-san&#39;s place…☆

You can’t replace him, Mike-chan-senpai… But hmm, I do need to beat you, too…
Okay! I’ll have a match with you today! I won’t let you beat me~! Dash, dash~☆

Aaalright! That attitude’s exactly what makes you one of my kids! Mama’s not gonna hold back either, dash daaaash!

With Mao
Location: Hallway

Isara-dono~☆ Look, look! I bought this shuriken online!
I lost all hope and cried when I saw that it was out of stock… but when I checked the site again a few days ago, I saw that they had restocked it!
I just knew I had to buy it immediately, and spent all my pocket money to obtain it!
Now I&#39;ll have to survive with only scraps of food to get through the month, but I have no regrets! As soon as I see this shuriken, I’m the happiest I’ve ever been~♪

Ahh, yeah. I get that you’re super happy, but… could you move away from me a bit?
The pressure’s getting kinda painful. You suddenly jumped on me, so I couldn’t prepare myself to catch you.

Wawa—! Are you hurt anywhere? I was so enthralled about the shuriken and about seeing you that I lost myself for a moment!

That part about you isn’t very ninja-like, huh~? Anyways, don’t you always have shurikens with you?

Do you mean the rubber shurikens? Yes, I have plenty!
But this one I bought is a replica of a shuriken Hattori Hanzo once used.

Whaa…? That sounds really fishy… You alright? You sure you aren’t being conned?

Ahaha, I’ll be fine~ I would know if it was a fake, even if the item was said to be genuine.
But it matters not if it’s fake or replica — I can love anything that is ninja-related~♪

With Midori
Location: Near the Auditorium

Midori-kuuun! I found what you were looking for! Ahh, but please do confirm if it&#39;s the correct one.

Mhm… this is it alright… Thanks for helping me find it, Sengoku-kun…

Oh no no, I&#39;m the one who&#39;s thankful that you gave me this mission.
We don&#39;t have unit activities today, and I had a lot of spare time, to be honest…
I&#39;m excellent at finding items, so please do ask for my help again if you ever need it~♪
However… What sort of basketball practice would cause you to launch the ball all the way over here?

That’s what I wanna know… I was told we’d have practice in the basketball court today, so I begrudgingly headed over there…
Then Morisawa-senpai apparently shot the ball outside the court… Jeez, we’re not playing soccer here…

Ahaha… Nevertheless, I&#39;m glad we found it.
…Hm? Isara-dono just messaged me. Heheh! Looks like I have a new mission to do!
I shall take my leave here! See you tomorrow, Midori-kun!

With Chiaki
Location: Gym

Yoohoo, it&#39;s mee~! Hmm? I&#39;m the only one here, huh? Oh well, guess I&#39;ll practice some dribbling on my own!

Worry not, Akehoshi, for I am here! Let&#39;s practice together! Let&#39;s shed the sweat of youth…☆

That&#39;s kinda gross, so I&#39;d like to switch partners, thaaanks~ And don&#39;t get near me, &#39;kay? Ugh, why&#39;s Chi~chan-senpai the only one around…

Well, that&#39;s because we have club activities today! The rest of our members should come soon, so let&#39;s shed the sweat of youth together until then…☆

I just said not to get near me! I was trying to ignore your existence by emphasizing that it&#39;s only me here, y&#39;know!

Oh! I thought you didn&#39;t notice me, that&#39;s why I called out to you as loud as possible. Well, no matter! I&#39;ll be defense, so hit me with your best shot!

Did you not hear what I just said? I don&#39;t wanna play basketball with you!
Especially since you get even more annoying when you&#39;re defense… I&#39;m gonna be defense instead, so you go on the offense, &#39;kay?

Why, of course! Right then, Akehoshi, here I come! Make sure to accept me whole…☆

Gah, he&#39;s just as annoying on the offense… I don&#39;t wanna try taking you on, so I&#39;ll just dodge.

Why not, Akehoshi!? I&#39;m always ready to take all of you! You know what, let me go back to being defense!
Alrighty then, you&#39;re free to leap into my arms…☆

Uurghh… It&#39;s seriously sooo annoying to deal with him when he&#39;s energetic… You guys need to get over here already~! I can&#39;t take this anymore~!

With Mao
Location: Fountain

Zzz… zzz…♪

Oh, Subaru? You&#39;re gonna catch a cold if you sleep here, y&#39;know~

Mmm…? Mmmmm…?
Huh? It&#39;s Sarii~! Goooood morning~! ☆

Woah, don&#39;t jump on me. You&#39;re pretty energetic for someone who just woke up…
Wait, something fell off of you. What&#39;s this… a basketball magazine?

Mhm. Chi~chan-senpai shoved it on me, saying something like, &quot;Akehoshi! I can guarantee you that this&#39;ll inspire you to play if you read it!&quot;
I don&#39;t really care for it much, but I know he&#39;ll come back asking me for my thoughts, sooo…
I was reading it while lying down, but I ended up sleeping halfway through instead!

Ahaha, so it just ended up being a good way to fall asleep for you, huh?

Yeah, I mean, I like basketball, but I&#39;d rather move my body than study up on stuff. I looove playing with balls…♪
Hey, Sarii~! You free right now? Let&#39;s play basketball together! I wanna play around with a ball!

Hey now, you&#39;re gonna wrinkle my clothes if you tug on me.
Hmm~… I wasn&#39;t really gonna do anything except go home since I don&#39;t have any Student Council work, so sure, I&#39;ll join ya.

Yaaay, I looove you~! Okay then, let&#39;s head to the gym! I wanna score some goals…☆

Sure, sure. Haha, you were reading the magazine properly all along, weren&#39;tcha?

C&#39;mon, Sarii~, let&#39;s goooo! Get your legs moving! The ball is waiting for us~! ☆

With Midori
Location: Staff Office

Excuse meee~! Sagami-chan, you here~?

………

Ohh, Takamin? What&#39;s up~? I didn&#39;t expect to see you here~☆

Akehoshi-senpai, please don&#39;t hug me… Urghh, you&#39;re as clingy as Morisawa-senpai…

Whaaat~? Don&#39;t lump me with him~! It doesn&#39;t make me happy!

U-Uh…? Anyway, Sagami-sensei isn&#39;t here… Wouldn&#39;t he be at the infirmary…?

Mmm~ It&#39;s a pain to go all the way to the infirmary, so I guess I&#39;ll just leave the paper I&#39;m supposed to turn in on his table.
What about you, Takamin? You here for the same reason?

No, I&#39;m just here to turn in my homework…

Oooh, what kinda homework was it? What do you first years even learn in your classes? I&#39;m super curious! Lemme see~☆

Uuu, please stop getting up in my face… I don&#39;t mind showing you, but there&#39;s nothing interesting about it, y&#39;know…?

Huh, so it&#39;s for history class? Woah, did you draw this one here?

Ah, do you mean the historic figure I had to draw…? Please stop staring, it&#39;s embarrassing…

Why&#39;re you embarrassed? It looks amazing! I didn&#39;t know you were good at drawing!
Draw me next time you can, Takamin! I&#39;ll treasure it~! Promise me, okay? ♪

With Midori
Location: Near the Gym

Midori-kun, sorry to ask this outta nowhere, but… I&#39;m Ryusei Black, right?

Huh…? W-What even…? Wow, that really is out of nowhere…

Well, I was thinking… I&#39;m Ryusei Black, so my outfits are black, too, right?
So I was like, why not I make my belt black, too?

&quot;Belt&quot;…? Do you mean your karate belt? I dunno how that works, but aren&#39;t only incredible people allowed to wear one…?
And that someone has to have cleared an insane trial… Like, taking a beating from strong waterfalls deep in the mountains, or defeating the Four Heavenly Kings… right…?

Where the heck did you get that idea from? You just pass the promotion exam to become a black-belt.
Thing is, though, it&#39;s not easy beating it. I&#39;ve gotta train harder and harder…
Wait, how could I forget—that&#39;s exactly what fires you up about it! Sorry &#39;bout what I said earlier! I shouldn&#39;t have made it sound so easy!

Huh? Why&#39;re you apologizing to me…? Actually, why&#39;d you even talk to me about it…?

OOOHHH!! This Nagumo Tetora&#39;s gonna do his absolute best~! ☆ It may take some time, but I&#39;ll be a black-belt before I get as old as Taishou, you&#39;ll see~!

W-Why&#39;s he suddenly getting fired up… Um, Nagumo-kun? I&#39;m gonna head over to my club, &#39;kay…?

Chapter 1
Location: AV Room


Time: Back to the present

chiaki~♪
i Sent the children back home. i only went up to the station[1] for the Train, though.
i’ve completed my mission! will you praise me, chiaki? ♪
have i become a proper hero? just like you?

… Eek!?
A-Ahh, yeah! Good work! You really are a reliable comrade, Kanata! I knew you’d be able to accomplish your duty safely! Fuhahaha! ☆

… were you crying?

Huh!? No I wasn’t! Don’t say such absurd things, Kanata! You little~!! ☆

… okay. heroes only shed Happy tears, yes?
hehe. you’ve become so amazing and wonderful…
even though when we first Met, you were always in Tears, Shaking in fear.
no… that hasn’t changed.
i was wondering why you wanted to Stay behind… so that was to avoid having the children see you Crying… is that it?
you always want to show off your cool side, even though you’re so easily embarrassed~♪
(but, such a pitiful person still Saved me. i’ll never, ever forget… until the day this Ocean is completely dried up.)

Uuu… No, it’s just that it was already late in the night, so we had to take them home. Though, part of it is because I didn’t want them to see me cry…
Look here, Kanata. While cleaning, I found the old Ryuseitai uniforms we have never worn since then.
I couldn’t get myself to throw away the stuff my seniors left behind… we ended up adding new stuff on top of it, too, so the pile’s gotten really big in here now, but—
These uniforms were still buried deep inside. So many memories came flowing back into me when I saw them, so I felt like crying…

ahh… that’s why you were acting so Hyper earlier.
hehe. after that performance, we were skipping about, unable to perform any live shows…
so we wore our p.e. uniforms, and ran everywhere in order to Help anybody.
and that’s why you forgot all about these Uniforms, yes?

Yeah. I wanted us to have our own uniforms that suit us, instead of using the ones from our past legacy.
That’s why I asked Kiryu to make new ones after everything finally ended.
Ahh, it’s all coming back to me… All the old members of Ryuseitai quit after the Battle versus the Sea God.

yes. i was an oddball joining ryuseitai, so they probably Didn’t want any Troubles that come with that.
even the old Leader left. and then, that title became yours.
hehe. and the rogue was Planning on joining a new Agency, so—
i found it very funny that he had Dropped out of school in secret before that live show.

Don’t laugh at that… Why are you only this harsh towards Mikejima-san… But it kind of feels like you have no restraint regarding him, like you somehow seem very close with him — it’s enough to make me feel a little jealous.
Hehe. Well, he quickly tried to retract his decision to drop out, but still left Ryuseitai anyway—
He must’ve had plans of his own or something, because he never returned to Ryuseitai after that.
He mainly worked overseas while jumping between different units.

yes… now that he works Overseas, it seems like he’s considering trying to obtain his own Influence through it—
and then, he wants to destroy my family’s Religion for sure this time.
not that there’s any purpose… i lost many Worshippers at the battle versus the sea god. they’ve been essentially Annihilated.
once i Graduate and have enough Free time, i’ll Cooperate with Him—
and Remodel our religion into something that matches this Generation.
it’ll be hard, because the Religion has been going on for a long, long time. it may take some Time, but i’ll take Responsibility.
i’ll come back when i’m done. so please let me sing with you then, okay?

Mhm, I’ll be waiting for you. I’m always ready to welcome you back. … In fact, don’t hesitate to call for me if you’re ever in trouble.
I haven&#39;t decided my own path yet, either. I’m in a shoddy state at the moment, because I’ve barely taken responsibility for my future—
But I’ve gotten stronger, even if only by a little. I’ve been working hard to grow stronger without ever giving up.
I’ll save you, no matter what. And not only that— I’ll always be your ally.

i know that, chiaki…♪

Chapter 2

but… your path hasn’t been confirmed yet? i’m surprised — so even you can be something of a Punk, huh?[2]

Punk? Like Kiryu? Oh, because I haven’t made any progress yet, right… Ahh, well—I think I made it a little too hard on myself.
I got greedy, y’see. I couldn’t get myself to give up on any of my dreams, so I decided I’d make them all come true.
Well, Tenshouin said he’ll mediate for me, so hopefully everything will turn out alright.
I owe him a lot… Ryuseitai was able to live on thanks to him, too.
Last year, we couldn’t win a single DreamFes as a unit with an Oddball member—
Ryuseitai was extremely close to dissolution, since we were practically broke in unit funds…
But Tenshouin started giving us work outside the school in secret, and we managed to keep the unit going.
Well, I get the feeling that he just pushed the tough community service that no one else wanted to do onto us, because he felt like we’d be able to enjoy them.

hm. well, maybe it was his Atonement for hurting us five Eccentrics.
i refuse to forgive him, though~ because he made my Friends suffer.
it’s not about what happened to me — the real problem is that he got Involved with my Friends.
on the other hand, the temple guy is surprisingly not that Revolting.
i won’t listen to what he Says ever again, though… by that, i mean his Wishes. it’s all his fault that i couldn’t stay as a god, after all.
as frustrating as it is, i suppose i could also say it’s thanks to him.

Mhm. In retrospect, everything changed thanks to their revolution.
We’re now in a world where effort pays off. And we even have more good-natured, talented allies with the same ambition.
We were finally able to get five members, just like a typical superhero squad — so knowing we’re going to have to graduate soon feels lonely, but…
As long as we don’t give up on our dreams, surely we’ll be able to come across each other anytime.
And the reason for that is! Heroes never ignore those calling for help! They’ll always come rushing if anyone ever needs them!
And the other reason is! Because we were able to become heroes…☆


Ossu! Excuse me!

Woah, wha--!? Ooh, Nagumo! I didn’t even call for you, yet you came rushing over, huh!? You really do have what it takes to be a hero!
What’s up, what’s wrong!? Did you forget something!?

I’m not the only one who came back~ Look, we’re all here.

Hello… I don’t think you called for me, but I came back anyway…

So have I~! ♪
Nihihi~ You see, on our way home, Shinkai-dono told us about the past… He spoke in such a peculiar manner that there were many incomprehensible parts of the story—
But after collecting our thoughts, we decided to come back.

… You told them about the past? Kanata!?

yes, i did. i am sorry, chiaki. but i Exaggerated most of it, and kept what you wouldn’t want them to know a Secret.

Ahh, so you were exaggerating things…
All that meteorite stuff, and how Morisawa-senpai apparently mega-exploded when he was in a pinch, and revived himself within the flames… It all sounded like a lie to me from the start…

i wasn’t Lying~ that’s chiaki’s Finishing move: “super phoenix explosion”~♪

Well, I’m sure that part was nonsense, but… I get the part where he struggled through a lot…

Ossu! We felt like it wasn’t right of us to be the only ones going home, leaving Taichou behind when he’d been working hard all by himself ever since his first year…
So the three of us messaged each other and came right back here.
Though I do feel bad, since Shinkai-senpai went through all the trouble to take us home.

I was planning on heading straight to bed, but… eh, my house is nearby, so it’s not that big of a deal…
I started feeling gloomy after everything that had happened, and couldn’t get myself to sleep, so—
My mind felt at ease when Tetora-kun called me…♪

Yes! We dashed straight over here!
It may be a no-no for us to stay up for so long, since it is important for idols to have their beauty sleep, but! It is a hundred times better than to regret doing nothing!
Now then! Let us combine our powers and finish cleaning this up~☆

Yep, leave it to me… I’m good at arranging things and packing them up…♪

Ossu! I’m not good with that kinda stuff, but I’m great at anything that needs hard labor! It’ll make for some muscle training, too ♪


You guys… I see, I was such an idiot.
I don’t need to shoulder everything by myself… not anymore.

hehe. it’s hard to let go of old Habits and outdated Customs. even i act like a god sometimes.
but, we’ve changed.
we’ve transformed. like this— this is No.1’s transformation pose…♪
you’re the one who taught me this.
thank you, hero…♪


Translation Notes
↑ Kanata originally says densha no ko, implying either Tetora or Shinobu go home by train.↑ Originally, Kanata says kurou for “struggle”, and Chiaki misunderstands it as Kuro’s name. To convey a similar feeling, Kanata says “punk” to mean “an inexperienced young person; a novice”. Thank you Peace for the localization!]]></content>

Chapter 1
Location: Pool


Time: Two Years Ago — Beginning of Summer

Heh… The ally of justice has arrived in all his splendid glory.
Now, let’s begin our Super Hero Time! As long as I’m here, evil shall never prosper! Fuhahahaha!! ☆
…………
(… It’s too scary! I’m trying to shake off my fear with super cool catchphrases, but I can’t take this anymore! I wanna go home~!!)
(Uuu… Just the thought of the school at the dead of the night is terrifying enough…)
(A dirty pool filled with sludge only makes it worse… It’d be more shocking if a ghost or demon didn’t show up…)
(No! It’ll be fine! Ghosts don’t exist! They’re just something people see when they’re half asleep![1] It’s only my imagination!)
(Besides, despite having idols for students, the school’s security is really low… What I should be more cautious about are the chances of a suspicious person intruding the place!)
(The most terrifying thing in this world has always been humans, not imaginary ghosts!)
(Uuu! You idiot, me! Why are you even talking about freaky stuff!? I-I’m just gonna stop thinking about this!)
(Let’s get this job done quickly, and go home!)
(F-Fuhaha! My duty for today is pool cleaning!)
(This pool is barely used, so it’s been dirty for a long time now. But apparently the other day, some of my comrades from Ryuseitai lit up sparklers here…)
(They ended up not only leaving burn marks, but also dirtying the place with leftover food, so the teachers are furious.)
(It sounds like the actions of my members are becoming inexcusable to the faculty staff…)
(Sagami-sensei told me in secret that they may disband it at this point.)
(But I can’t let that happen! I won’t let Ryuseitai end like this—Not when it has such a long and proud history!)
(There are still some members who never take part in any of these bad deeds, and properly work hard — like our leader, Taichou!)
(I’m going to protect Ryuseitai myself! No, I’ll save it! No one asked me to do this, but I’ll still start by cleaning all the dirt from the pool!)
(I’m sure that if I make the pool usable, the teachers will think better of us!)
(I had a lot of unnecessary work pushed on me all day, so I couldn’t start until late at night…)
(It’s dark, creepy, and terrifying here, but! I’ll be fine! The night always comes to an end!)
(Let’s do this! Justice will always prevail!)
Hmhm~hmm~… ♪
Woosh! Chiaki Crusheeeerrrr!! (Cleans the pool’s floor with a mop)
Now’s my chance! Take this! Finishing move: Chiaki Beaaaaaaam!! (Washes it down with a hose)
Fuhaha! How’s that!? Feel like giving up yet, you evildoers!? Yup, let’s go with the idea that the black sludge was created by the malice within people’s hearts!
The only person who can purify it all is the one and only, Morisawa Chiaki…☆
Yes, aaalright! I’m all pumped up!
Now I can forget all about my fears, and—
…Eeek!?
(Huh!? W-What was that weird sound just now!? A dog’s wail…? Or maybe a bird…? Or was it just my echo…?)
… (Gulp)
U-Um, hellooo…? I-Is there someone… out there…?
…………
(… N-No response. Of course there wouldn’t be.)
(No one in our school is enthusiastic enough to practice past schooltime, and the teacher currently on duty isn’t that serious about their job, either.)
(I specifically chose a day like this, just so I could clean the pool in secret.)
(This is something I personally planned to do… If someone catches me here, I could get scolded for doing something wrong.)
(Even though I’m doing the opposite.)
… Even though, I only want to become a hero.

“hee-roe”…? what is that?

…!?
(… Huh!? W-What!? Somebody’s collapsed within the sludge!)
(He’s soaking in it! I-Is he dead!? No, no! He spoke just now, didn’t he…!?)
A g-g-g-ghost!? Oh no, it’s really here—Eeeeeeeek!!!!

what is “goo-st”?
i do not know this Word. could you teach me, please?

Huh!? Um, no… What!? W-What are you!? I’msosorrysomeonesavemepleasedon’tcurseme I’m not tasty!!!

…?

…E-Eeek!? W-Why did you just lick me…!? That was mortifying!!

salty.
i know! you are from the Sea as well, yes…? ♪

ENG Proof: Shie, Gold
Chapter 2

Time: Several minutes later

Hmm, okay… I’ll hose you with water like you asked — Are you sure you’re okay with that, urmm… Shinkai-kun?

yes! i Love water~ it is my Life force!

Uh, yeah… I think that could be said about anyone, really… Also, you’re covered in sludge at the moment, so it makes sense that you’d want to wash yourself off with water.
Do you have a change of clothes with you? You wouldn’t want to go home completely drenched, right? If you don’t have any, I’ll bring some over.

…?
i am very sorry. please talk more Slowly. i cannot pick up what you are saying.
i apologize. i am not used to having a Conversation…

Huh? Ahh, sorry! Did I talk too fast? I don’t have any friends, so I’m bad at it myself!
Hehe. You always seemed like a distant being, so I’m happy to know we share something in common.

? is that so? you are Happy we share something?
why would you be Happy about that?

(U-Urmm… I feel like we’re never on the same page… It doesn’t feel like I’m talking to a human being… Although, he does seem to know Japanese.)
(He keeps asking me questions after everything I say… this conversation is getting nowhere.)
(I’m not that knowledgeable myself, and I keep getting stuck trying to answer all his questions.)
(Is there no one around Shinkai-kun to teach him all of these things…?)
(It doesn’t look that way, though… I’ve got the impression that he’s a well-known student within the school, and that he constantly has followers around him.)
(Shinkai Kanata… We’re in different classes, and I’ve never talked to him until now, so I don’t know much about him, but…)
(If I remember clearly, he passed his entrance exam with flying colors. He even ranked as high as Itsuki Shu and Hibiki Wataru for certain subjects, or possibly even higher.)
(That’s only a rumor, though. The entrance exam results have never actually been shown to the public.)
(Still, he’s a prodigy from a different world compared to me, an ordinary person.)
(I studied hard for the same exam and, my results for the written portion aside, my practical skills were unremarkable.)
(Although apparently I would’ve still been accepted into the academy even if I’d never bothered to study…)
(I just have to believe in the fact that everything I’ve studied and learned won’t go to waste… Not just that, but for everything else I’ve done so far, too.)
(For now, I have to work hard, then work harder, then even harder and harder.)
(It’ll all pay off if I just keep working hard to the best of my abilities… I’m sure of it.)


…? what is wrong? ummm, you…?
i did not ask for your name, did i? could you tell me what it is?

Huh? Ahh, you wouldn’t know who I am, would you…?

yes! i Realized this recently! a big discovery! heheh~♪
each Human has their own Name!

Uh…? Yeah, of course we do. Everyone gets a name from their parents.

from their pa-ren-ts? what is “pa-ren-ts”?
is it a Necessity? where can i get one?

What? Umm…?

if it is a Necessity, then i would like it. i have to act more Human, or everyone will be in Distress, it seems.
where can i get one? or do i need to Buy it with Money from some place?

(… What’s he talking about!? Does he really not know the concept of parents…!? No, no! There’s no way that could be true, right…?)
(No, wait… He might have a complicated family situation.)
(He is from another world, after all… I don’t think I should dig into this topic.)
(Not when I’m nothing but a nobody who just so happened to talk to him.)

? what is wrong? could you give me a Response? i am sorry. was it a difficult Question?

Ahh, no… That last question was a bit too difficult for me, but I can answer your first one.
My name is Morisawa Chiaki. I’m a first year like you, and I’m currently in a unit called Ryuseitai. I’m still in the lower ranks, though.
Ryuseitai doesn’t have as much influential power as Othello[2], but it does have a lot of members. It’s split between two squads: the first squad is always performing onstage and brimming with glory, while the second squad supports them.
I’m in the second squad, and I’m meant to do the trivial tasks. And honestly, it’s only natural that I was placed in it; I’m a newcomer. I could never allow myself to take a senior position.

“ryu-sei-tai”… ahh, mikejima’s Manservants?

Mikejima? It is true that he’s in the unit, but I’ve never talked to him before.
He may be a first year, but he’s the leading star of the first squad. He’s completely above my level… Is he your acquaintance?

what is “a-kwain-tans”? is that different to Family?

F-Family? Mikejima-kun’s part of your family!? Your brother, maybe? Ah no, you’re both the same age and you don’t look the same, so that can’t be it… right?

hmm… i think he wants to become Family, but… i do not quite understand… how long will he be Playing house…?


…?

Chapter 3

just give me water already. do not make me repeat the Same thing twice. you Should listen to what a God says.

Ahaha, you’re a God, Shinkai-kun? Well, you do have godly potential.

yes. from the day i was born, until i die.
chiaki, you are not a God, are you?

Y-You’re casually calling me by my first name, huh… It’s fine, though. Nope, I’m not~ I’m just your ordinary, everyday guy.
But even someone like me can make your little wish come true! I’ll spray water on you! Be careful not to slip and fall from the water!

yes, feel free to do so. i have been waiting.

Ah, but before that! If you want to clean the dirt off of you, then you’ll need soap! Wait a moment!
I think there was some equipment near the drinking fountain…?

mm… just do it already, please. i Cannot do anything without Water.
i will dry up… without Water, it is painful…
that is why i had jumped into this Pool, thinking there would be Water…
but, there was none… i banged my head on the surface, and Fainted.
it was an Earnest match between the two of us~… chiaki? are you listening?

(Humming) ~♪~♪ Oh! I found the soap! Ahaha, it’s so fancy! Alright, I may as well find a towel to wipe the dirt off!

--… …hurry.
chiaki… i… really, will--…

Hm? Shinkai-kun, did you call for me? Just give me a second longer!
If I remember clearly, there was a jersey in the room for Ryuseitai — I’ll bring one over. It’s better to have a change of clothes, so!
I think that jersey was left behind by the student who quit our unit the other day, so it should be okay to use it…
Yeah, I’ll just make sure to wash it and put it back in its place so I don’t end up stealing it.

…………

… Shinkai-kun?
W-What’s wrong!? Say something, please! The dark is terrifying! I was able to forget about all my fears because you were chatting!

…………

Shinkai-kun? Woah-- Why are you collapsed on the floor!? Is it from anemia? Did you faint!? Are you alriiiiight~!?

… chiaki, w-water…

Water!? Yeah, sorry for the long wait! I’ll spray water on you now! Here goes--!!!

…………☆

W-Was that good enough…? Please say something!

…whew~♪ yes, i am feeling Better now. i have been revived.
Kyahahahahaha!! ☆

Eeek!? W-What!? Don’t laugh out of nowhere! You surprised me!

i am sorry! i am just so happy, and feeling tingly…♪
hehe. if it is what you Wish, i will not laugh.

N-no, I’d rather see you smiling than have a straight face… The sudden laughter took me by surprise, that’s all.

hehe. you are the Timid type, yes?
Kyaha-- Kyahahaha! ♪ Kyahahahahaha…!! ☆

(E-Ermm…? Nevermind, it really is terrifying, Shinkai-kun! I don’t get anything you do — It’s just too bizarre!)

… am i scaring you?

!? Wha--!? Did I say it out loud!?

i can tell by your Face. i have been slowly able to understand those things…
humans have many, many Expressions, especially compared to fish.
i am sorry for scaring you… and thank you for the water.
i have to Repay you somehow, since you have given me a Tribute.

Tribute? No no, no need for anything! It’s been awhile since I—no, I think this is the very first time I’ve properly helped someone, so I’m more than happy!
Your smile is my reward! Hehe, that sounded a little bit like a hero~♪

“hero”[3]… what exactly is that? you said you want to Become that, yes?

Huh? Ahh… You heard me talking to myself… That’s so embarrassing…

is it something embarrassing?
it is alright~ i will not look Down on it. i will Affirm any Wish, because i am a God.
if that is what you wish, then i will grant it for you. that is my Job. will that be a sufficient Repayment, chiaki?

Ahahaha, if I could make it come true just by wishing, it would be a lot simpler than this. Reality isn’t so simple in the end; it’s different from tokusatsu shows.

“toku-sa-tsu”…? what is that?

Mhm, I’m sure you’ve seen it at least once, haven’t you? You’re a guy, after all! C’mon, y’know, it’s the ones that go “*Transform!*”

… “to-rans-form”?

Yes! Like this, and like this! This is No.1’s transformation[4] pose, and this is No.2’s! ☆

number… one…? i am sorry, i do not understand…

Huh. You’re not the type to watch TV? Then why did you want to become an idol? Is it because you watched one at a liveshow or something?
I’ve always watched all kinds of idols perform on TV! It’s how I came to like them, and why I wanted to become one!
Becoming a hero is hard when reality is the way it is, but I could become an idol if I work hard, right?
I want to become the dream version of myself! The cool, ideal version!

Content Warning: Light mentions of bullying and cannibalism ahead.


… is that your Wish, chiaki?

Yep! It’s proving to be difficult, but! Finding out that Ryuseitai existed after entering this school made me jump with joy!
I mean, they’re hero-like idols, y’know? It’s the exact ideal I’ve yearned for!

hm, that is ryuseitai…?

Yep! Oh, though… I don’t know if you know this, but at the moment, Ryuseitai is pretty far from being “heroic.” I mean, they’re still only halfway there when it comes to behaving like idols!
The captain, Mikejima-kun, and some others have been properly acting as idols, but…
The others, especially the second squad, just rely on those members, and play around as they like.

hm. is it a bad thing to Play around? both Playing and Singing[5] are a splendid way to worship, though…?

No no, it’s not bad… I’m just unsatisfied — I don’t feel like it’s enough. I mean, the way they act is the usual for this school, but…
If they just live off of the legacy of the past without ever working hard themselves, then they’ll never be able to put all their heart into this. I feel like we’ll end up in a tight spot, personally…
But the last time I got fed up, I yelled at them to be more serious… And after that, it looks like they just saw me as an eyesore.
They don’t speak to me anymore, and they’ve been pushing all kinds of unnecessary work on me ever since…
Is this bullying? No no, it must be my fault for not properly reading the atmosphere, right?

atmosphere… yes, that is a Necessity.
does that mean you are Suffocating, chiaki?
that is Sad… you will die if you cannot breathe…

Huh!? No, I’m not physically incapable of breathing!
Don’t worry, don’t worry! I won’t die! I’m fine!

hehe, you will not die? so you ate Mermaid meat?

Huh? Ahh, do you mean the Yaobikuni legend?[6] You know about that?

yes, since it is not Unrelated to me… but, then, what is your Wish?

Hm? Ah, no, it’s not a wish per se… I just want everyone to be a little more serious, that’s all.
Well, there’s no point in me asking for that, though.

? what do you mean?

… Ryuseitai will likely disband soon if it keeps going at this pace.

hm? what is “dis-ba-nd”?

It means it’ll disappear. What a shame, Ryuseitai is the very first unit established in Yumenosaki with a proud and long history…
Besides Mikejima-san, only our captain is doing his job properly, but apparently he’s been hired from overseas.
There’s still some time left before graduation, but there’s talk that he’s already preparing to leave.
Which means he’ll be dropping out of school to start doing independent work. Those types of people aren’t rare — Talented students always abandon studying here and leave for someplace else.
You’ll gain nothing from being here, after all…
The classes are poor quality, no one bothers to do anything, and lately the school’s been having a bad reputation within the industry.
Any talented student capable of starting their own independent career has no reason to stay here.
Also… No adult in this school helps you out in anything, and if you stay around the rotten students, you’ll turn rotten yourself.
Even I… If I could just have more talent and capability--…

…………

Ahh, I’m sorry for complaining. Point is, only the captain of Ryuseitai has been properly working as an idol, but he may leave the school. That’s why Ryuseitai might disband.
All the members who had been leeching off of him are at a loss, and aren’t really sure what to do.
So lately, all they’ve been doing every time we meet is talk badly of the captain, calling him heartless and stuff…
Just because he’s the captain doesn’t mean he has any obligation to take care of his fellow members.
“Captain”… “Leader”… Those titles are only something written in documents — They don’t mean you have any responsibilities, or influence.
But apparently, the captain plans to quit being an idol to become an action star instead.
Which means, there’s less chance of him bringing any idol work to us through our connection as Ryuseitai.
That’s why the members who had been aiming for that are voicing out their frustrations.
They were hoping to suck out all the good bits from the captain by being part of this unit, so now they&#39;re complaining that they were betrayed…
The captain knows this, and it seems he’s gotten fed up with it. He doesn’t show up to the unit’s gatherings anymore.
Not that we do any practice when we gather, anyway — Everyone just plays around.
But soon, we won’t even have gatherings like that anymore.
Ryuseitai will naturally disband on its own, I think. With the way things are right now, there won’t be anyone to inherit the role of the captain, so.
Everyone has been talking about leaving the unit, and joining Othello instead.
No one will bother to protect Ryuseitai. They just want to do whatever’s the most convenient.
As for what I’ll do… I don’t want to become rotten like the rest, but I don’t have the capability to protect Ryuseitai.
I’m trying to help the unit stay alive by cleaning the pool, but… If it disappears anyway, then all my efforts would be futile.
I’m starting to find it pointless to protect Ryuseitai — There’s no hope.
There’s no point in continuing my hero act all alone, either… I’d only waste my precious youth like this.
I’m so weak, so dumb, so pathetic… I criticize others but I’m not any better — I’m just going with the flow without accomplishing a single thing.
The ideal image of the hero I yearn to become is still so far away — I could almost cry.
…………
… Oh! I’m sorry! I just talked to myself for ages! I’m sure it was boring and awful to hear…
Hehe, you’re so strange, Shinkai-kun… I’ve never ever vented any of these thoughts out, but…
You’re not even my friend, yet I can’t help but tell you my secrets.
Please forget everything I said. It has nothing to do with you.

… that is true. the Land has Nothing to do with a god.
but, it is because a god is Distant, that he can see Everything.
i have watched from Above, and Understood your Wish.
please leave everything to me. i will grant your Wish. will that be a sufficient Repayment, chiaki?

(He was once part of Ryuseitai, so I thought he could help me out…)
(He was also once the Super Idol, and he’s a teacher, too—He has the power to change things, unlike me, just another nobody.)
(He’s the only person I can count on. I hate that I’m trying to rely on others for my own benefit, though… but…)
(Sigh…)
(—Wait, this room is a mess. I wasn’t aware of this back when I was just one of Sensei’s fans, but it seems like he can be really sloppy.)
(Alright, I’ll tidy this place up just enough, but not so much that he’d be uncomfortable with it. I’m good at cleaning — I mean, I’m always being forced to do those types of jobs, so.)

Shove off, brat.
I wanna sleep here. Dunno what you’re tryin’ ta do, but you’re gettin’ in the way. If ya keep goin’, I’ll step on ya!

Ah!? Uuu? I’m so sorry! I’ll move right away!

Haha, why’re ya talkin’ so polite, we’re the same age… Whatever, fine by me.

H-How did you know that…? Ah! Is it from my necktie?

Huh? We’re in the same class, Glasses-boy.[8] It ain’t everyday ya find a guy who actually goes to class, so I know who you are.
I’unno your name, though. Ain’t like I ever pop in class, so.
But whatever. No need to be so scared — jus’ leave me alone and I won’t do anythin’ to ya.
I ain’t gonna hurt ya or somethin’. I don’t ever lay a finger on good people.
Ahh~… Sheesh, I can finally rest.
Glasses-boy. I ain’t showin’ up in class today, so tell the homeroom teach. Not like they ever check anyway, but just in case.

Ah—Yes! Understood!
But, umm… You’re Kiryu-kun, right… You should come to class, y’know?

Huh? Don’t talk to me like we’re best buds. I ain’t even got the energy to talk…
Besides, this school’s got no problems with skippin’ classes once or twice.
Are ya just as goodie-two-shoes as ya look?

Ah—Um, no, it’s just… I’m sorry! That was presumptuous of me!
I’m sorry if I bothered you! I seem to have a problem with saying the first thing that comes to mind…!

(U-ummm…? He ignored me? Was I too irritating? No, actually… he really doesn’t seem to have the energy to talk with me…)
(What happened…? He looks beaten-up…Was he hit by a car or something…? S-Should I call an ambulance?)
(Or maybe I should call for Sagami-sensei through the loudspeaker… Ah but, I feel like I’d get punched if I went too far.)
(There’s rumors that he’s the delinquent of the academy, after all…)
(I’m terrified…! But… he’s covered in wounds… Doesn’t he need those treated? I don’t think he’s going to die, but I don’t think it’s okay to just leave him like this…!)
(It doesn’t matter if he’s a delinquent! I can’t overlook a wounded person! Be brave, Morisawa Chiaki! If you leave now without doing anything, you’ll only regret it…!)
K-Kiryu-kun!

… Huh?
Ugh, you’re still here. Get lost already, you’re gonna be late for homeroom class.

Uuu? Um, but, uh… Errmm, what did I wanna…
Ah, yes! I wanted to treat your wounds! I often hurt myself by accident, so I know how to do first aid!
Look—It’s only going to swell up if you don’t do anything about it! And the bed will get bloody, too! You shouldn’t bleed on it, y’know — Who do you think cleans them?

Already forgettin’ what ya jus’ said? You’re givin’ me first aid, aren’t ya? Here—I’m leavin’ it to you, so do whatever ya want to.

Honestly, there’s nothin’ ta get from involvin’ yourself with a punk like me.

Haha, you were “a man”? You’ve got such a cute, boyish face[9], I couldn’t tell.

Hehe, so you can crack jokes like that, Kiryu-kun? I didn’t expect that, with how you’re always silent and looking so sour during class.

Huh, that so.. Well, I jus’ don’t really like ta talk, is all.
Nobody comes over to talk to me, anyway — Guess they’re scared or somethin’. I don’t even bother tryin’ ta talk to the other guys skippin’ class.
But, eh, guess school is for studyin’ anyway, not havin’ fun with friends.

Y-Yeah, that’s right. I didn’t expect you to be the type to think about this seriously.

Well, yeah… I’m tryin’ ta take it seriously, after all. Not that there’s any point in doin’ that here. Even the teachers seem like they’ve given up — They do whatever they want for their classes.
What an expensive waste… This school ain’t cheap.

Yeah, I feel the same way, too. … Okay, let me clean the wound — It’ll sting a bit.

Got it. … Sorry for makin’ you help me out, Glasses-boy.

It’s nothing, don’t worry about it. After all, it’s a hero’s duty to help those in need!
(—Wait, what am I even saying? Stop it, you can’t just say what immediately comes to mind!)

… Huh, so you’re a hero.


Huh? No, that’s, uh… Forget about it! It’s embarrassing!

Hmm… Ahh right, you’re in Ryuseitai, aren’t ya? So the title ain’t just for show, huh — There really are guys in there actually bein’ heroes.
You guys have an awful rep. Keep hearin’ that you break stuff everywhere, and make a huge ruckus wherever you go…
Well, since I’m a delinquent an’ all… the whiny brats in the streets are always tryin’ ta pick a fight with me, yeah?
That’s where I hear your unit’s name a lot. Always sayin’ they’re an eyesore and all, that they’ll put ’em down sooner or later, or whatever… Better keep yourself safe if you’re out at night.
You all just seem to be doing whatever you like, but you guys’re all just spoiled li’l brats born an’ raised from a well-off, sheltered family in the end.
All you guys’re gonna be done for once a real delinquent’s got their eyes on ya. They’ll play with ya like a plush toy ’til there’s no stuffing left inside ya.
Just go play around somewhere the nicer, peaceful adults can protect ya.
Don’t bother comin’ into the sewers here — There’s nothin’ interesting floatin’ around.

… My bad, I talked a li’l too big. I’m sure ya wouldn’t wanna be lectured by the dregs of society… Sorry ’bout that.

No, I’m thankful for the warning. You’re a good person… Kiryu-kun.

Huh? You got your eyes on wrong or somethin’? How the hell’re ya seein’ somethin’ good in me?
I’m just as delinquent as I look. I ain’t someone people like you should be minglin’ with.
Talkin’ to you and joinin’ this school… feels like I’ll start regrettin’ it all…
I really was dreamin’ of a chance to possibly becomin’ a more honest, good man, though…

…?

… Doesn’t matter. So, you done? Thanks, I appreciate it.
I’m goin’ back to sleep now, so go to class already… Honor student.

No, hold on—I haven’t finished the treatment. I’m not one to give up halfway when doing something, so please let me finish up.

Haha, you’re surprisingly fussy, aren’tcha?

Hm… But how did you end up covered in bruises like this? You seem to have been kicked and punched all over, there’s no other way to explain it… Did you get into a fight?
You shouldn’t do that. Violence solves nothing.

Huh? Ain’t that backwards? Violence is the only way to solve anything.
At the very least, that’s the kind of world I’ve been livin’ in. I asked for this myself, and now I’ve gone rotten and become a shitty delinquent.
Harming everything around me… And lately, I’ve been payin’ the price for that. That’s all there is to it. I ain’t actually goin’ around pickin’ fights or anythin’.
I got caught and surrounded by my old pals, and, y’know… I took their blows without fightin’ back, and there you have it.
I ain’t done any resistin’ nor defendin’, so I guess you could say I’m the victim here.
But you got nothin’ to worry about — It’s unlikely this’ll cause any huge uproar… so I won’t cause any problem’s to all ya idol brats.

W-what do you mean? Your old pals…?

It’s none of your business. … Just forget about it, I’ve already said too much.
It’s better off if you just pretend ya never saw me…
But you’re a good guy an’ all… Talkin’ to me and treatin’ my wounds even when you’re shakin’…
That’s exactly why I don’t want ya gettin&#39; involved with me any more than this. Seriously, I’m not jokin’ around here… Just don’t.
I hate, hate seein’ anyone else get hurt all because they got close to me.
If I let that happen again… I’ll really have had no reason to ever been born. It’d be unforgivable to my ma — the one who went through so much to give birth to me.

(…Oh, oh no. Class was over before I realized it.)
(I don’t like this. Feels like I’m a little depressed… I keep worrying about how much I need to do something already, but I haven’t accomplished anything meaningful at all.)
(That’s why I’m stressed, and overwhelmed by this feeling of powerlessness, and just… space out entirely. But there’s no real use analyzing myself like this.)
(I want to change the current state of the unit, but… I don’t know how, and I also don’t have the power to do anything. In the end, I wasn’t able to meet Sagami-sensei, either.)
(Well, telling Sagami-sensei probably wasn’t going to change anything, though…)
(Since I’m not his family or his pupil or anything; I’m just his fan.)
(Actually, I’d be reluctant to impose on him when he’s exhausted and retired, but…. There’s no one else I can rely on.)
(Ahh… I’m so depressed, I just keep sighing. This is bad. I need to pull myself together. There’s no use worrying about it—I need to act first.)
(I can only do what I can, one step at a time.)
(It might be useless—someone like me, struggling to make something happen—but it will all add up… It has to be better than giving up and doing nothing.)
(That’s what I believe. That’s what I want to believe—that even I can make a change.)

Hey.
You there… I mean, excuse me, could we speak?[10]

Eep!? Wh-what is it… um, class rep?

Hasumi. But if you want to call me “class rep,” that’s fine. I am the class representative, after all.
And because nobody else wants to take on the responsibility, I’m head of the library committee as well.

I-I see… Um, that must be a lot of work.

Not really. Taking on such titles means that I receive that much authority as well.
Well, I also take on the responsibilities as well, but I accept that as something like a necessary expense.

(He has a long-winded manner of speaking. Hasumi-kun… I’d never spoken to him until now, so I didn’t know this, but he’s as straight-laced as he looks.)

? What are you scrutinizing me for… Is it my glasses?

Eh? No, sorry! Was I being rude?

Hmph. …Your glasses are rather nice as well. Where did you get them?

Huh? I mean… At an everyday eyewear store in my neighborhood.
My eyesight isn’t that bad, but I got these when my dad got a pair. He said that it’d be cheaper with the family discount if we purchased together.
I gave my dad a lot of trouble with my tuition, so I thought it would be good if I could help him save up.

I see. Well, glasses get quite expensive if you want to purchase good ones.
They say you get what you pay for, but lately even the stores for middle-class customers sell higher quality glasses, perhaps because they manage to save on material costs through mass production.
That’s capitalism. Companies compete through pricing and the like, and ultimately quality is improved overall.
…I feel like that thought will be a useful lesson of all sorts. I’m going to write it down, so give me a moment.

Okay… Um, so what is it, really? Did you want to talk about glasses that badly?

No. I want to talk to you about something else. You, sign this… I mean, I would like you to sign this.

Sign?

Yes. I’m actually thinking of establishing a Student Council.

A Student Council…? Wait, Yumenosaki didn’t have one? Don’t schools usually have one?

Indeed. There seems to have existed one in the distant past, but at one point no one had inherited the position, and it eventually disappeared….
And then it was kept in this strange limbo of whether or not it actually existed for the longest time.
When I asked a teacher, I was told that I essentially needed to start from scratch to create an entirely new Student Council if I wanted to make it active again…
And when I looked into the school rules, it seemed like I needed over half the students in the school to sign the petition.
Well, knowing the teachers at our school, I suspect they won’t even properly examine the conditions when we establish it, but….
I don’t want to pretend I established it properly, only for them look into the fact that I didn’t get enough signatures to officially do so… That’s why I thought I would go through the proper procedures.
I want to prove that we have obtained the approval of the students—that the students want us, the Student Council.

Hehe. I see that you’re a serious guy, Hasumi-kun. I don’t dislike it.

That is my strength. In any case, the Student Council is an organization that supports students—just as the name suggests. It should be helpful without getting in the way.
So if you could, I’d like you to sign this, saying… “I support establishing a Student Council.”
I keep running around and bowing my head, asking people to sign, but most people don’t even listen to me.
And it’s becoming a bit of a hassle. I feel like I’ve tripped before I could even start running.
Worst case scenario, I could ask Eichi to bribe them in secret, but… No, I’d rather not already owe him at this stage.
If possible, I want to stay equals with him. Being indebted to him forever… Just thinking about it makes my heart sink.

? What are you talking about?

Nothing. It’s just about my situation. So… will you sign, or will you not?

Ah, right. If that’s the case, I’ll gladly sign. I can even ask around and help you gather more signatures, too.

Hm. That would be helpful. You don’t seem like the kind of person who has many friends, so I won’t expect much, but… I appreciate it.

We should help each other out during times of need, y’know. I hope you manage to establish the Student Council.

Thank you. Well, I have no idea how this will go, but I plan to do my best.
Please lend me your support for my dream. If even just one person sympathizes with my cause and is willing to support me… I can continue to fight.
Please believe in me. I will be the one to change Yumenosaki Academy.

(So there are students other than me who don’t feel like the academy can remain the way as it is right now…)
(That makes me happy. I feel reassured! I’ll also do my best — Well, I’m still not sure what I could do, but…)
(First, I’ll work on cleaning up the pool. I couldn’t do much last night after chatting with Shinkai-kun.)

Huh…? Um, well, for starters, your clothes will get wet… And it may be the summer season right now, but you could still catch a cold if you keep them on.

catch a… Cold?

Huh? Why do you look so confused!? Have you never caught a cold before? That means you have a really good, healthy body! I’m jealous — I’ve always been prone to illnesses!

hm… so by a Cold, you meant an illness?
i will not become ill, as i am a God. in fact, i should be the one to Heal the illnesses of others, shouldn’t i?

what’s wrong, chiaki? are you feeling down?
rather than feeling Down, it is better to be floating Up on water instead~ here, chiaki, why don’t you puka puka with me too?
puka puka… it feels nice~ all your Troubles will be washed away~♪

T-That so? Well, I mean… It does seem like it feels nice…?
But I don’t have my swimsuit with me right now, so I think I’ll pass.

eh~ how heartless… even though i Cleaned up the Pool just for you~?
i thought you would smile and be happy…

…?

i thought this way you would puka puka along with me… it is unfortunate. chiaki, so you were not Cleaning the Pool for that purpose?
it seems i was mistaken. i am still very much Inexperienced.

Uh… um. What do you mean? You cleaned this pool, Shinkai-kun? That’s how you make it sound like, but—

yes. because i thought that was one of chiaki’s Wishes. but it seems that i was unfortunately Mistaken.
then, what is your true Wish? was it the “become a hero” one after all?

Urm… Well, yes, that is my number one dream, but, hm…

hm~ i am not very sure what a hero is, so i am stuck. what exactly is it?

Huh—Um, I’m not sure how to explain it off the top of my head… Well, like… It’s a cool being, who would protect everybody.

? is that not what a God is?

No, it’s different from a God. It’s more realistic, like… Defeating villains one after the other, and upholding justice to the very end. And they’re always protecting the helpless—

hm~? i am unable to make a distinction between the two… to defeat Villains — is that different from Divine Punishment?
this is difficult… i recall mikejima was called a hero by others… perhaps i will ask him. after all, he seems to Know many things.

Hm? What’s up with Mikejima-san? Ah, so he returned back to Japan, huh? But I don’t see him in our Ryuseitai meetups…?

hehehe. mikejima immediately breaks anything, you see. but, he Fears that side of Himself the most.
so, when he feels Irritated, he leaves to someplace Far away, as he does not want to meet with his Frightening Self.
but lately, he is probably in this Country more often. see, since i am here, after all… and mikejima’s Job is to be Useful for me.
i don’t really need him to, though… for mikejima to do all the Work is so stingy of him, isn’t it? don’t you think so too?

Huh? Huhhh…? I’m sorry, I’m not quite sure I understand you!

is that so… are the things i am saying difficult to comprehend? i am sorry, i am still not used to Speaking very much.

Ah, no, there’s nothing you need to apologize for—Oh.
Sorry, seems like I’m being called over. I’ll have to go now!

called over?

Yeah, I got a text from our leader… I wonder what this is all about…? I don’t think he’s even been around at school ever since he decided to quit.
Well, no matter. I’ll know once I ask him.
Hehe, alright then, Shinkai-kun. I’m happy we got to talk. Oh, and… you cleaned the pool in my stead, right? I really do appreciate it.
(Just thinking about how he managed to clean the pool in one night is a little unsettling, but…)
(He didn’t do anything wrong, and it seems like he simply did his best for my sake.)
(It’s been a while since I’ve been treated this kindly — I feel sort of touched.)
Hehe, well then, I’ll see you later… Shinkai-kun, I know I keep saying this but — You shouldn’t soak yourself with water, okay? It’s still too early in the season to swim.

hm? i am not swimming, i am just puka puka-ing.
if only there were other Places like this around…
i feel as if i will dry out. the Land is always so dry, it is difficult to Breathe.

…?

Content Warning: Mentions of violence ahead.

Location: Downtown


Time: Same day, at dusk

(I don’t believe it!)
(It’s like I’m in a dream! Everything’s suddenly heading in a better direction…! … is how it feels. But this isn’t a dream, right? It isn’t some joke, right…? This is completely real, right!?)
(Mhm! It hurts when I pinch my cheek! So this is real~!! He he he…♪)
(… I don’t know how, but Ryuseitai has changed.)
(Our captain came back after a long time of absence, and brought all the members together to give them a huge pep talk.)
(I’m amazed how he even found this information, but he pinpointed every single shady place they were up to no good in—)
(All of them had fallen into nothing but bad habits, but the captain gave them an eye-opening lecture.)
(I expected all of them to be against him, and find his speech irritating — it would only be natural if they did. And if not that, then they may never want to be scolded like that ever again, since they’re the sensitive type of teenagers…)
(So there was a possibility that they would simply leave Ryuseitai.)
(But, for some reason, neither of those things happened. Maybe this is more evidence of how honorable the captain can be, or maybe there’s another reason behind this…)
(I don’t know myself, but the captain made each and every one of them promise that they would continue to work hard as members of Ryuseitai.)
(And it seems like all of them took his scolding to heart, because they accepted his passionate speech.)
(And they even proved it right after — by practicing together properly, as best as they could.)
(They’re all so talented and experienced at being idols, so much more than someone like me… All they needed to do was to give it a shot.)
(If we keep up our training, we could overtake Othello, or even the unit that’s been the recent talk of the academy, Valkyrie.)
(We could become the number one star in Yumenosaki Academy—No, in the entire idol industry, even.)
(And with such a dream stretching out before us, our future will be shining brightly.)
(Hehehe… Somewhere deep down, I was hoping that someone like the captain or Mikejima-san would scold everyone and motivate them to work hard, since they have great influence on the unit—)
(Hoping that one of them would quickly and easily solve Ryuseitai’s problems, and clear the clouds obscuring our unit….)
(But I gave up on the thought, because I figured it would be impossible for it to actually happen… I thought that Ryuseitai was only bound to rot away as time went by…)
(But my fantasy became a reality, and my dream—my wish came true.)


—is that your Wish, chiaki?


(—… No, that can’t be… Shinkai-kun has nothing to do with this.)
(He may have called himself a God, but I felt how warm he was when we went into contact.)
(He appeared to be human, like me. He can’t be a God who grants anything you wish for.)
(… Is that really true…? Then how did that filthy pool become spotless in one night? Is there really an explanation for something as bizarre as that…?)
(Wait, no, but… Hmmm? I mean, it matches up pretty well, since it was right after I mentioned it—so maybe the only possible conclusion is that he granted my wish through mystical means—)
(… I must be going crazy. Something so miraculous happened that I’m losing my mind.)

Hey.
Hey!! Don’t go ignorin’ me like that!

…!?
H-Huh? Kiryu-kun!
W-What’s wrong…? Why are you crouching in the dark…? Are you not feeling well?

… Well, guess you could say that.
But it’s nothin’ worth makin’ a scene about.
I was born sturdy an’ healthy, so I’ll be alright even if I don’t patch myself up, and if I’m wrong, don’t go callin’ for an ambulance, alright?

O… Okay…? Wait… you really got roughed up again, didn’t you!? Really, what actually happened!? Are you alright!?

Didn’t I just say not ta make a scene? Don’t make me say it again — talkin’ is hard to do right now.

(Yeah, I’d expect as much… Those are some terrible wounds! S-Something’s definitely up! What should I do in times like these?)

Haha, sorry for buggin’ ya on your way back home.

N-no, I don’t mind… I have nothing planned besides going to sleep once I’m back home, anyway.
Nevermind that, please tell me what happened to you! Is there anything I can do for you?

Yeah… Let me use your shoulder for a bit.
I got real roughed up out there and can’t move anymore… How pathetic… I jus’ need help walkin’ — stick with me ’til we get to the station over there.

O-Okay. It’s a short distance, so I’m fine with that. It would have been better for me to carry you there, but you’re pretty big… I don’t think I’m strong enough to do that.

Haha, relax, won’t ya? Won’t be askin’ ya to do anythin’ impossible.

Content Warning: Heavy mentions of violence ahead.


Thanks, Glasses-boy. I only called to ya cuz I got nothin’ to lose anymore, so I might as well call for help — I didn’t expect ya to actually come to my aid.
Guess you can find someone ta help no matter where, huh… Woah—

A-Are you alright? Here, hold on to my shoulder! Go ahead and lean on me, I’ll support your whole body!

Thanks. … You seem weak an’ all, but you’re actually more well built than you look, huh?

Yes! I’ve been working out! I used to be against working out[11], since I was afraid I wouldn’t grow any taller, but—
Oh, I’m in the Basketball Club, so! That’s why it’s better if I could grow taller!
… Wait, what was I talking about again? Uhh… umm…?

Haha, don’t go into a panic. People are gonna turn their eyes on us to see what’s happenin’.
I don’t wanna attract any eyes, y’know… Sorry for askin’ for so much, when you’ve been helpin’ me out here.
See, the guys I got caught up with may come back for more punches, so—
Let’s move quietly… I know I’m saying this far too late, but I still don’t want to involve you in this.

Mhm, it’s much too late, I’m already involved.
I know it must be annoying that I keep asking this, but I’d really like a proper explanation… What happened? If you were beaten up, then it’s clearly assault. Can’t you report this to the police or something?

Stop. Don’t you dare report this to the police, Glasses-boy.

It’s “Morisawa Chiaki”!

What?

My name is Morisawa Chiaki. I just realized I hadn’t introduced myself until now, so!

That so. You gotta get yourself together, ain’t it part of the hero deal to introduce yourself in a cool way?

Huh!? Kiryu-kun, do… do you like tokusatsu!?

Huh? Ain’t got nothin’ to do with that. It’s jus’ common knowledge.
My li’l sis is still young and all, so she watches those magical girl shows on her days off, and since they’re both on in the mornin’, sometimes she ends up watching tokusatsu, too.

Oh, so you have a little sister!

Yeah, she’s a real cutie. She’s an absolute treasure to me.

I see. I’m an only child, so I’m sort of jealous of people with siblings.
—Wait, did you just try to dodge my question?

Haha, why you little… You’re the one who went changin’ the subject first.
Well, whatever. Sure, guess I’ll give ya the rundown of what’s goin’ down… I still don’t wanna give ya any trouble, but you have been helpin’ me out, so. Can’t keep pretendin’ we’re strangers anymore, ‘specially now that I know your name.
… I’ve been a shitty delinquent for a real long time now. Used to do so much dumb shit, and makin’ my family cry over it.

Hmm… I’ve heard rumors about that before. You were the leader of all the delinquents in the area, or something?

Not exactly that, but I was known for bein’ real skilled in a fight. Not that any of it was worth much.
But, y’see… I wanted to change that about myself.

…………

Might’ve been too late to, but I still wanted t’ try livin’ an honest life.
At least, just enough ta never make my adorable li’l sis cry, ever again… I wanted ta be a respectable “Onii-chan”.
I can’t go huggin’ her when my fists’re covered in someone else’s blood. But, I still wanted ta hug her.
The li’l girl holdin’ her knees all alone, speechless at the sight of our ma’s deceased portrait…
I jus’ wanted ta carry her and take her anywhere she ever wanted, no matter where that was.
That’s why I came to Yumenosaki, even. Wanted to be like the idols makin’ my li’l sis smile. I even cut ties with my old delinquent buds.
Or, I should’ve by now… but once ya soak in the swamp, it’s hard ta clean off all the mud.
They come ta pick fights with me practically every day now.
Those guys I beat up keep comin’ back for revenge, and my old pals come ta get back at me for turnin’ on ’em, callin’ me a traitor.
Every day… every damn day, they beat me up — I’m gonna get a concussion one of these days.
But ain’t nothin’ I can do about it. That’s just what I gotta do ta make up for it all. It’s what I get for bein’ a dumbass for so long. It hurts so damn much, though… I wish I didn’t have ta deal with it anymore.
But I won’t punch back, at least. I’ll take all their punches… I’ll keep holdin’ on, hopin’ it’ll end someday.
If my honest life comes after all the beat-downs, then I just gotta hold on as hard as I can ‘til I reach it.
I dunno if this is the right choice or not, but… all I can do is believe, and keep goin’.
I ain’t good at usin’ my head, y’see… All I ever do up ‘til now is solve things in a fight… don’t know any other way. Can’t even think of another.

…………

… That’s the whole story, I guess. Sorry for makin’ ya listen ta all that boring stuff.
I’m good from here, Morisawa. I got enough energy back ta walk on my own now.
Hehe… I’m gonna pick up my li’l sis now, don’t wanna keep her waitin’. Ya really helped me out here.
Even if I gotta crawl all the way there, I’ll still get there on time as long as I’m on the train.
I can do what she wants me to do, after your help. I can keep bein’ her “normal Onii-chan”… so, thanks again, Morisawa.

Location: Front Gate


Time: Next day, early morning

…………
(… I couldn’t really do anything for Kiryu-kun in the end. He completely refused my offer to go with him after helping him reach the train station.)
(I considered doing it anyway, but then he glared at me… And it froze me from trying. All I could do was just rush back home with my head low.)
(I’m such a coward.)
(Was he really alright…? No… There’s no chance he was.)
(What he went through was awful… It doesn’t matter what he’s done in the past, it still doesn’t mean he deserves to get beaten up on a daily basis.)
(I want to help him, but I don’t know how. I mean, he said he’d kill me if I reported it to the police… I’m not sure why he’s so against it, but I could tell he was serious.)
(It’s so frustrating. If only I really was the hero of my dreams… If only I could do a grand transformation sequence, and take down all the villains—)
(… Hm? Huh, why do I hear noises near the entrance? What happened…?)
(I-I’ll at least go check what it is, just in case. Not that I’m a hero or anything—I’d probably just turn out to be another person caught in the trouble…)
(But even if that’s true, there must be something I can do!)

Location: Fountain


Oohh…!?
(W-What!? There’s a fountain at the entrance! Huh? Wasn’t this fountain broken for the longest time…!?)
(There was a fence around it, too! It was blocked off to warn students not to go near it, since there was so much rubble that someone could trip on it!)
(But now there’s a brand new fountain here, like nothing had ever happened! That’s so strange—I didn’t see or hear any kind of construction going on…!?)
(W-What’s going on!? This is just unfathomable! There’s no way this was done the normal way!)
(What is actually happening here…!? I’ve been seeing so many bizarre situations lately…!)

puka puka…♪
ah, chiaki~♪ we keep running into each other lately, don’t we?

Woah!? Shinkai-kun! So it really was you!

…“so it really was”…?

Uh, no, um—… I keep saying this, but I really don’t think it’s a good idea to bathe in water with your clothes still on.
And you’re doing that in a fountain this time, so it looks even more suspicious and strange than before. You’ll be reported if you’re not careful, y’know?

? what does “re-por-ted” mean?

Huh!? It means someone might call the police on you…!?

the Police? then, it is Fine~
the Police are our Manservants, after all.

(…? What? Did he just say manservants? I assume it’s simply a joke, but he’s making a joke out of a government authority… They’re people you can’t go against at any cost, aren’t they…?)

hehehe~ will you puka puka with me for today?
it feels very good, so~ how about it? you seem to be feeling down, so—
you will be revived if you puka puka. without water, i cannot Survive… that is why i Fixed up the Fountain.

Um? So, Shinkai-kun… You really are the one who repaired—or well, rebuilt this fountain, huh?

yes! now, i do not have to go all the way to the Pool to Splash about. c’mon, chiaki, you too…♪

W-Woah—!! Don’t try to pull me in! Your arm power is stronger than I expected…!?

is that so? but what does “arm power” even mean? if it is strong, is it something to be Happy about?

Y-Yes… I suppose it’s better to have strong arm power than weak, yeah…
But I don’t want to think that it’s much more righteous to be strong…

“Rai-chi-ous”? what is that?

Hehe, you ask such difficult questions, Shinkai-kun…

hmm, is that so… was that difficult? am i troubling you with my Questions?
i am sorry… but, there are many Things i do not yet know. i would like to learn more about all of you.
because if i do not know, i will not be able to Help.
which is why i decided to Enroll into School, but… it is still difficult~ there are More and more things i do not know about.
it is troubling… even though i have to Grow faster…

… Is that so. I don’t completely understand what you’re saying, but I get how you feel, sort of.
I want to grow stronger, too…

really? you too, are the same?
hehe, it makes me happy to know we share something in common… right, chiaki? ♪

Ahh… We had a talk about that, didn’t we? So you still remember it, huh?
I’m kind of happy. People kept ignoring me and finding me annoying—like I was just a background character, and it didn’t matter if I were here or not…
But you’ve been listening to what I’ve been saying, haven’t you?

yes! chiaki’s Stories are interesting. i can Learn many things from them, and that makes me happy.
you have been Providing me so many things.
that is why i would like to Repay you. how should i go about doing that? how can i make you Happy?

Oh no, there’s no need… I haven’t done anything worth being repaid.
(—Actually, wait. This may be my chance. I’m powerless and can’t make any impact on this world…)
(But maybe with this mystical kid—maybe if I could borrow his strength… even I could do something. He may be my transformation belt[12].)

… chiaki?
hehehe, that Expression… so you do have some kind of Wish, don’t you?
tell me any Wish, and i will grant it for you! because i am a God, and that is my Job~♪

Huh? Um… But—
(What am I thinking… He may seem capable of rebuilding a fountain in one night, and can perform other miraculous, unfathomable spectacles, but…)
(Just because he can, doesn’t mean I should ask him to do another. I have no right to do so. We’re not friends—we’re nothing to each other. I should solve my problems on my own.)
(I don’t want to be a helpless victim that asks for help from heroes—I want to become a hero.)

… chiaki? what is wrong? do not Hold back, hurry and tell me your Wish~♪
i can grant it for you~ no matter what it is~♪

…………
… No, I won’t. I won’t be wishing for anything from you.

huh~? why not? you are being so mean, chiaki~?

Shinkai-kun… Alright, then let me wish for one thing. Stop relaxing in a bath here, and go to class before it begins.
You may be a child prodigy with excelling grades, but you could be expelled if you keep doing as you like.
You’d have to repeat a year, y’know? So go to class like you should.
You’re in a different class than me, but I’ve heard rumors that you don’t show up to class at all. Your class seems full of that, though—Hibiki-kun seems the same way.

hibiki… oh, he is the same, isn’t he.
is he a God, too…? he grants everyone’s Wishes so skillfully…
he is Bothering my Work, so i find him quite the Nuisance.
and the same goes for the second year named “rei”… hm?


Yo, Morisawa.

Ah—Kiryu-kun! Did everything go alright yesterday!?

Yep, thanks to you. I was able to reach my li’l sis’s preschool.
She looked lonely waitin’ for me for so long, and I made her worry over my sorry state.
But the important bit is that I was able to pick her up. Thanks, I owe ya one.

Oh, no… I’m more than happy to know that the little I’ve done could still help you out.

Hmm? Don’t go and make it more complicated than ya need to. You’re supposed to just say “you’re welcome” when someone thanks you, y’know♪
Well, whatever. I said what I wanted to say, so I’m goin’.
See ya. … Also, I do thank ya for yesterday, but…
Seriously, don’t get involved with me, aight? Like I said, I ain’t in the safest kinda place right now.

Um, okay… Are you really alright? If there’s anything I can do, please tell me!

Huh? Don’t get ahead of yourself, you dweeb. Ain’t nothin’ you can do for me, got it? It’s my problem, I’ll clean it up myself.

…………


… hm, i see how it is now.
you are being stingy, chiaki.

Huh!? W-What do you mean, Shinkai-kun?

a Hero really is a God after all, isn’t it? after all, saving people is what a God does, isn’t it?
the reason why you do not Wish anything from me… is it because you are a God, too? or rather, because you want to become one?
a god can grant Wishes, but they do not Wish for anything themselves. that’s what this is, isn’t it?

No, no… I have no clue what you’re saying once again, but… I’m not a God, and I don’t want to become one, either.

but… why, then? why won’t you Wish for anything from me? is it because you do not believe in me?

No, it’s just… I don’t know you that well.

hmph, then just forget it. if you won’t say it Yourself, then i will have to Ask someone else.
and through that, i will confirm what your Wish is, and grant it for you… will you Believe me then?
first… i will grant the Wish that involves that Large person from earlier.

“Large person”? Do you mean Kiryu-kun? N-no, stop! He has a dangerous problem of his own, I’m serious! You’ll get more than a burn if you try to interfere, y’know!?


a “burn”? i will be just fine. Water can extinguish Fire. no—i am a God, so i will not get Hurt no matter what.

Time: One week later, after classes

(How incorrigible.)
(This is not what I had anticipated… Not a single step of progress has been made… It makes me want to cling to the guidance of the Buddha. But as someone who has come down from the mountains, I should not expect divine protection.)
(I’m frustrated. I don’t have any backup whatsoever. Is this the limit of my individual strength? Never mind changing the world—I can’t even make a ripple in the pond.)
(… This is incredibly regrettable, but—I may have to speak to Eichi at once, and ask for his formal cooperation.)
(I mean, I speculate that he feels the same as me, but… I haven’t actually made sure if that’s really true, and I also don’t want to rely on him—since he’s so sick and frail.)
(And anyway, he likely can’t move as he pleases—as long as his monstrous grandfather reigns alive.)
(He doesn’t have any money or power at his personal disposal; right now, he’s simply a frail rich kid.)
(But right now I need supporters… I need comrades. I thought I understood this already, but you really can’t change anything on your own.)
(I need an organization that will do my bidding. That’s precisely why I’m trying to re-establish the Student Council.)
(Yet, I’m currently stumbling at that first step. How pathetic… It pains me, but I suppose I should ask Sakuma-san for his help.)
(Sakuma-san has an excessive amount of influence and popularity. If I can pull him into this, I can influence the entirety.)
(Everything will change… Though if possible, I wanted to accomplish that with my own two hands…)
(But under these circumstances, maybe I should just cast my pride aside? Hmmm… It does feel shameful, though.)


Hasumi-kun!

? What is it, erm…?

I’m Morisawa, from the same class as you. Here, I brought the signatures you asked for.

Signatures… Oh, I did ask you for those.

Yes. I told the Ryuseitai captain what was going on, and he helped out, so I managed to gather a good number of signatures.
Pretty much all the members of Ryuseitai signed on, so.
I don’t think they seriously support establishing the Student Council, but rather signed it because the captain ordered them too, but…
A signature is a signature. It won’t be completely useless to you, I hope.
Here. Please accept them.

Ahh… Thank you, this is tremendously helpful.
You’re right, this is a lot of signatures. I’m grateful; we’ve gotten much closer to establishing the Student Council now.

Is that so. Mhm, well then, I’m glad I was helpful.

Indeed. Truthfully, I wasn’t expecting much from you[13], but—

…“You”*?

Ah, erm… I didn’t have very high expectations of you—I had forgotten that I’d even asked for help, since I’ve been asking almost everyone around.

I’m not surprised. Hehe, you were just asking around shamelessly.

Hmph. That’s what we need to do—otherwise, ordinary people like us can’t change a thing.
…Oh. That was rude of me to lump you in as “us.” I apologize.

No, I think you’re right. This world is probably run by a small, limited number of geniuses.

No. I think it looks that way, and that might be the case, but… I don’t want it to be.
When I was young, I thought I was a special being. But there is always someone better. I must be ordinary, but… I refuse to spend my life looking down because of that.
Morisawa, was it? If the likes of*—I mean, if you feel the same, I hope you’ll continue to support me and the Student Council. I’ll show them what ordinary people can do.

Of course. I’m cheering you on. I hope you manage to establish the Student Council.
… Whoops. I actually snuck out of a practice session, so I need to head back now. I saw you from the window, Hasumi-kun, so I rushed down here.

Hmph. Sorry for taking up your time. But you could’ve just talked to me in the classroom, since we’re in the same class; there was no need to do it now.

Yes. But isn’t it nice to hear good news as soon as possible?
Well then, I’ll be going now.
He he he… Lately everyone in Ryuseitai has been getting serious, you see—we’re all much more passionate about practice, so it’s fun.
That means we have much more work to do, and I’m absolutely exhausted by the end of the day, but… I feel fulfilled. Ahhh, if only these days would continue forever.

Hm. Things really do change, huh. I was under the impression that Ryuseitai was a hang-out for slackers.

Yes, I won’t deny it. But lately the captain has been strangely enthusiastic.
Well, he’s going to leave the school and head to the USA soon, so… I get anxious thinking about what’ll happen after that.
But it should be fine. I think everyone just didn’t know how to work hard—or the joys of working hard either.
To try your very best, and reap the satisfaction of growth and accomplishment…
Now that they know how wonderful it all is, I’m sure they’ll continue to participate in Ryuseitai’s activities seriously.
That’s what I believe.
Well then, Hasumi-kun. See you tomorrow at school.

Yes… See you tomorrow.
(… He’s an idiot.)
(He must be extremely well brought-up. He doesn’t understand how human nature works; he believes that what’s said on children’s TV is the truth.)
(I’ve helped out with funeral services since I was little. I spent time with adults, and listened closely to their stories, so…)
(I know that humans are two-faced, and I know how easily the hidden surface can rot away.)
(Humans are not simple like the characters in a manga are. They’re contradictory and all over the place; they cast aside what’s good and fall astray so easily.)
(That’s why I need a driving force that will accept both the good and the bad, and push everyone forward nonetheless.)
(Like the teachings of the Buddha, like the law, which stands above others and administers justice… something transcendental.)
(I don’t know what that something is yet, but—)
(I will make that mine, no matter what. If God is keeping that entirely to himself—then I will kill him to obtain it.)
(“Ryuseitai”… The oldest idol unit in our school. Even a disorderly crowd can become a force once they band together; they can make possible what is impossible for just an individual.)
(These signatures… I couldn’t have gotten them on my own. I feel like there’s a lesson to learn here. I need to examine it closely.)
(An idol unit. A unit… Just as I thought, I need an organization. There’s no use for individuals to work on their own. I’ll look to organizations more closely from here on out.)
(Humans gather to create a society. If you want to change society, you need to move groups of people as if you’re playing a game of go. As if you’re watching everything from above, like the Buddha—)
(Hehe. Truly, thank you, Morisawa. Thanks to you*, I now know what path I must take from here.)

(Yes, yes, yesss! Morisawa Chiaki, you’re doing a great job!)
(Heheh. I didn’t just buy my favorite novels at the bookstore today, but the books I needed for my job, too!)
(You’re off to a great start already, aren’t you, Chiaki? Congratulate yourself!)
(I’m usually buying any tokusatsu merchandise and DVDs I can find, so I’m always low on cash…)
(And textbooks are usually pricey, so my allowance took a huge hit, but! I don’t regret any of it!)
(As long as I finish my work properly, I’ll get my share of salary! So it’s actually a benefit in the long run!)
(Hehe, to think that the captain would use his connections to introduce me to a job before leaving for the USA…)
(We’ve barely talked before besides unit business, and yet!!)
(He told me, “Oh yeah, you like heroes, right?”, which means! He was even watching over someone like me—a low rank in the unit! I’m so happy!)
(Thanks to his connections as an action movie actor, he gets to visit their studios often, and that’s how he managed to get me the stuntman job! He said they were already trying to recruit people!)
(I’m brand-new, so they’ll likely only give me the small tasks for now…)
(But I’m going to get the training needed in order to become a stuntman, and if I prove myself useful, then I might be chosen as a stunt performer!)
(Which means! If I work hard enough, I may one day also be able to become a hero actor, like I’ve always wanted!)
(Aaah~! This has always been a dream job of mine, Taichou! Thank you!!)
(In fact, I was going to follow that dream instead if I couldn’t get into Yumenosaki… But, I didn’t actually know how to get a job like that.)
(Because of that, I almost forgot I even had this in mind. But the captain saw right through me and realized this dream of mine, and showed me the path to it! Yes, yes, this is amazing! I’m so happy! I’m going to do my absolute best~!)
(The door to my future has opened! My wishes just keep coming true, one after the other! It’s sort of strange how that keeps happening to me, but there’s no need to feel bad about good things!)
(He he he… I’m going to head straight home, and start reading all these books I bought for the job.)
(I’ve bought books about this before, ones with interviews of actors playing as the hero, so I’ll reread those too.)


(Ahhh!! I’m just so excited! I don’t think I’ll be able to fall asleep tonight!! I’m too pumped up…!)

E-Eeek!?

Don’t you dare move! I’ll kill you!

I finally found ya, ugh… Took forever… Don’tcha have any friends? I asked a buncha people, but nobody even knows where ya live.
But this game of tag is now over. Haha, checking this area was a good idea.
We met here last time, yeah? You live somewhere around here?
Well, whatever. … Come with me a sec. We’ll talk over there, where it’s darker. Don’t want anyone seein’ us.
I got somethin’ real important to talk about. Better not try to fight, Morisawa… If you make me any angrier, who knows what’ll happen to ya, especially with how pissed off I am right now.

Hmph. Don’t make a single damn noise, it’ll look like I’m bullyin’ ya…!
People’re always mistakin’ me for a bully, but lemme tell ya — I got no interest doin’ that!

(W-what? He dragged me by the collar to the alleyway, and threw me straight onto the ground! It feels like I’m being attacked by a wild animal! I’m scared!!)
(What is this? Is this how it feels to get attacked…? I’ve been ignored by people often, but I’ve never been through something like this…)
Uuu…? What’s wrong, Kiryu-kun? Why are you so mad…? Did I do something to you!? I think there’s been some kind of mistake!

Huuuh? Quit messin’ around, dumbass. I was such a damn idiot for trustin’ you and tellin’ you my problems!
It’s me who’s got questions to ask here. The hell you tryin’ to do?

Uh, um…? W-What are you talking about? I have no idea what’s going on!

…? Seriously? That’s even worse. Y’know you could just be an actor instead of an idol, right?


Huh? Do you really think so? I hope I have the talent to do so—I mean, I just got a job as a stuntman for a mov—

Shut up! Don’t you dare open your mouth ‘til I tell ya to!

Eeek!? I-I’m sorry!!

I ain’t asking for apologies! Just stop talkin’ already! I’m already pissed off as it is!

W-What do you want me to do!? Please, I have no idea what this is about! Really! Let’s talk this through, please! Violence solves nothing!

Again? An idiot sayin’ the only things he knows, huh?! Anyway⁠—you’re seriously sayin’ that to my face?

…? …!?

… You. You did in my pals.

P-Pals? Did in…? Did what in?

I’m tryin’ ta tell ya! You beat up my buddies, the ones pickin’ fights with me a while back!!
It went viral, y’know! Quit actin’ all innocent already!

U-Um? Kiryu-kun, you’re talking so strangely, I can’t really understand what you’re trying to tell me!
Buddies? Are you talking about the guys who were beating you up…?
It’s true that I felt upset knowing the awful things they did to you, but I didn’t do anything!
I’ve never seen them in my entire life! I’m serious! Please believe me!! I don’t know anything!

Damnit, quit actin’ like ya know nothin’…!!

Eep—

You! You were the only one, Morisawa! The only one I talked to about my problems!
No one could’ve heard us, and I never thought about tellin’ anyone else about it!

How the hell did you do that!? These rebels run wild, but they showed up sayin’ sorry to me, like starvin’ animals or somethin’!
They were askin’ me to spare ’em!
They were all beat-up and bawlin’! When I was a delinquent, I had rough stuff happen to me before, but I’ve never seen my pals so scared ’til now!
They were cryin’, apologizin’, promisin’ they’d leave me alone, beggin’ me to stop!

I-Isn’t that… a good thing…? They were meddling in your affairs and bothering you, weren’t they?

Shut up!

Gyaa!? D-Don’t stomp your foot down! Please, it’s terrifying!

Yeah, be more terrified, cuz I’m freakin’ threatenin’ you here! I’m warnin’ you to never mess with me ever again, Morisawaaa!
What’re you plannin’? What the hell did you do it for? Did you just pity me? Huh!? Is that it!? Did you like playin’ pretend as a “hero of justice”!?

You don’t know nothin’ about me, so don’t freakin’ get up in my business! Did I even ask you to!? Don’t you freakin’ mess with me…!!
… Those guys… My old buddies were just worthless trash.
They’re just degenerates shunned by society… but that doesn’t mean you just do whatever you want to ‘em!
Besides… I may have my reasons for breakin’ off from them, but they were still my buddies.
We had so many fun times together… I have great childhood memories with them.
They started callin’ me a traitor, beatin’ me up for it, but that was fine. It was rough, but I handled it alright.
As long as I let ’em get their anger out, their beef would just wash away like water… they may be idiots, but they’re the simple, good sort of guys.
I’m fine with the guys I beat up gettin’ revenge on me, too. I deserve it. Gotta settle all that I’ve done in the past.
And yet, you…! I was alright with my situation, but you went off, beatin’ each and every one of ’em because they “hurt me” or whatever!
You broke ’em inside and out, to the point where they can’t do anything but cry and beg for forgiveness!
I never asked for any of that, but you went off and did it anyway!
I dunno what society’s worldview is, but even delinquents have their own point of view!
And you ignored all that, and destroyed them in the name of “justice” or whatever, and wrecked everything I’ve tried to do! Stop freakin’ messin’ with me here, you dumbass!

It’s fine now, when they’re still scared and obedient…
But as soon as they’ve healed and gotten past the pain, they’ll just go straight back to start. I was a delinquent once. I know how it is.
I never would’ve become one if I’d learned my lesson after bein’ in that bad a spot!
Trash will always be trash! They’ll never turn obedient!
What d’ya think’ll happen from here, huh? What’chu think they’ll do once they’re all better? D’ya know what’ll stick with ’em?
All the shame of bein’ driven to tears! All the anger from gettin’ beat up! All that pain’s just gonna make ’em furious! They’re gonna start doin’ even worse things after that!
This ain’t some kiddie’s tokusatsu show! Bad people don’t just change their ways! They’re gonna do every damn little terrible thing you can imagine! They ain’t got nothin’ to lose doin’ that, y’know!?
Morisawa, hey… Morisawa, you listenin’? Want me to tell ya what those guys’ll likely do right in the middle of their rage?
They’re gonna find the best way to hurt me. Fights’re just another way to say hello for me, after all.
But this situation ain’t somethin’ to laugh about now.
Those guys… They’re gonna go after my adorable li’l sis first.

Then they’ll aim for my family, my home, then my school… and, of course, me. They’ll hurt everythin’ and everyone I love. They’ll destroy it all.
People who’re soaked deep in hatred n’ anger destroy everything in their way.
They’ll never stop… no religion, no politician can ever save people like us. Violence only brings more violence, and it’ll just keep on going.
I’d been tryin’ to end it by bearin’ with the pain! That’s the only way I had to settle all of this! But you had to go and get all heroic and ruin everything!


Heroes’ll never be able to exist in this world! Quit your daydreamin’ already, damn brat! I’ll never forgive you!

Shinkai-kun!
(… He’s not here, either. Nor was he at the fountain… He’s nowhere to be found. He disappeared like he was just some kind of illusion or dream…)
(But I have to see him! He said something about granting my wish…! My wish regarding Kiryu-kun…!)
(And then something really did happen! The things I wished for, deep in my heart, came true! And the guys who were hurting Kiryu-kun suffered a terrible fate!)
(I swear I didn’t do anything! Shinkai-kun must have — I can’t think of any other possible explanations!)
(I don’t understand any of this, but! The one who wanted this—who wished for this—was me! I didn’t tell him directly, but somewhere in the back of my mind, I did wish that would happen!)
(I wished for justice to befall them! That all the delinquents who hurt Kiryu-kun would be punished for what they’ve done! But, something like that… anyone would think about that!)
(In reality, you can’t change anything just by making a wish! That’s what I’d thought, so I didn’t do anything but pray for it to happen!)
(And then somehow, Shinkai-kun must’ve read my mind and changed the world!)
(Like when the pool was cleaned overnight and the fountain was rebuilt the next day! He made it all a reality, like a God—like a miracle!)
(That’s the only possible explanation…! It’s unbelievable, but he… maybe he really is a God!)
(If that’s what you wanted me to believe, then I do! I won’t doubt you anymore!)
(So please, don’t do this! And if you can, please turn everything back to normal! Just pretend I hadn’t wished for anything!)
(This wasn’t what I wanted…! I just didn’t want Kiryu-kun to suffer anymore — I never imagined it would affect him and his family…!)
(I’ll never wish for anything so over-ambitious ever again!)
(It’s just like Kiryu-kun said! There’s no such thing as a hero in this world! So I’ll never make a stupid wish to become one ever again!)
(Please, just let me do this all over again! I—… Someone got hurt because of me! I can’t bear to think about it!)
Shinkai-kun! Where are you!? Please respond! Please, if you’re out there…!


—Yeees~♪

…!?

Goootcha! Too bad, so sad, don’t get mad! You thought it was Kanata-san, but it was I! Madara-san![14] ♪

…Huh!? M-Mikejima-san! So you really did come back! But why are you here?

…………

Ah… You wouldn’t know someone like me, would you… I’m Morisawa Chiaki, from the same unit as y—

Yep, I’m gonna stop you riiight there. You can sometimes be really hard on yourself, y’know. You don’t need to tell me who you are.
I have a great memory, and it’s my job to know eeeverything about anyone who’s involved with Kanata-san, so.
Needless to say, I know who you are… Morisawa Chiaki-san~♪
I know you like the palm of my hand, from your family ties, to what you love, what you hate, your backstory, how you operate… I have it all mapped out.
I know anything and everything. I’m not “God”, so I’m far from being omniscient.
But I essentially know everything, and can do aaanything. We, the Mikejima family, must do the bidding of God… or something like that! Hahaha, how old-fashioned~

…………
You are… Erm, what exactly? Shinkai-kun mentioned you; are you his friend?

Hahaha, nooo way, I could never say I’m his friend. He’s a God, y’know?
At some point in my childhood, I did make the careless mistake of wanting to become his friend, but the world—fate isn’t so forgiving about relationships like those.

T-That kid… Is Shinkai-kun really a God after all?

Yep. Or, at least in this region, he is. He’s an all-knowing God, and there’s pleeenty of people out there who believe in him.
You’ve been living an ordinary, everyday life, so you wouldn’t know about what lies within the other side of this world—the side with a mystical land inside it. Gods and flesh-eating monsters dominate the territory.
But I know all about it, so I’m here to tell you this: It’s best you don’t get any closer than this.
You should just forget all this ever happened, go back home and sleep soundly in bed.
That’s the best option for someone like you—who’s just an ordinary kid.


…………

Hahaha. Telling that to a teenage boy would only have the opposite effect, though.
They’re aaalways the type to yearn to escape from their boring everyday lives, and live a heart pounding, extraordinary one instead.
But, that’s exactly why I’m here to tell you about the disappointing truth—so you don’t yearn for it.
And that’s why I made a dramatic appearance and waited for you here, at this pool, in the dead of night.
By the way, Kanata-san has to perform opening ceremonies on the beach around this time of year, so he’s tucked away at his home.
He won’t be around campus, so you won’t be able to find him no matter how hard you try.
You’re just an ordinary kid, so you gotta live your ordinary life, right?
You don’t have the time to look around for a God, so lemme make your life easier~♪
Right then. Let me be honest with you—There are no such things as “myths”[15] in this world.

…? (surprised look)

“God”? There’s no way something like that exists. In this world, there are no superpowers, no aliens, no youkai…
You prooobably know this already, but there’s no place for fantasies to exist in a world controlled by the laws of physics.

B-But… You just said the opposite a second ago. You said he’s a God, didn’t you?

I was only saying that there are a looot of people who believe that.
That includes Kanata-san… to these kinds of people, who believe in such a being… They also believe that Gods, magic, and everything else like it are real, too.
That isn’s necessarily a bad thing. I mean, if you try to prove to people that Santa Claus isn’t real, it’s not gonna make anyone happy.
That’s why these customs don’t die out. Even now, mamas and papas dress themselves red, wear a white beard, and place presents under their children’s pillows for the ones who believe in him.
It’s just a daydream to give color to this boring world. And I think that’s wonderful—after all, festivals are a necessity in this world.
Kanata-san being a “God” is exaaactly that, Chiaki-san. There are people who yearn and dream for an omniscient being to make all their wishes come true.
Y’see, it’s ‘cause there was a terrible time when these fantasies were once needed to forget aaall about the pain of reality, even if only for a second.
Weeell, I talk like I’ve been through it myself, but obviously, I’m talking about a very old tale from before I was even born.
Kanata-san being a God is just faaar too stable a fantasy that it’s kept going all the way up to this very generation.
And, after a long period of preparation, this fantasy has even plotted a scheme to maintain itself.

ENG Proof: Revoltrad, SayonaraRevival
Chapter 17
Content Warning: Discussions of cult, and mentions of violence ahead.


I’m talking as if I’m not part of that “scheme,” but I am.
As long as there are people foolishly yearning for God, Kanata-san will always, always stay on the top of the shrine.
Even though him being treated as a God means that he isn’t being treated as a human being… He doesn’t think of it as misfortune and accepts it as his fate.
I couldn’t bear to see him that way… It was only for a mere moment, but once upon a time, we were friends—and there was a time when I considered taking him by the hand and getting him out of there.
But it was impossible for me. There’s no chance of me easily breaking apart such a long-planned scheme.
Zealots are frightening ones—They’d do whateeever it takes to protect their fantasy.
For example… they would even gather in the dead of night, invade a school, and clear an entire pool, despite gaining nothing by doing it.

(Ahh…)

Or, negotiate with the school to rebuild the fountain that’s been broken for sooo long…
Making sure to rebuild it all in one night… and making sure to do it in a way that wouldn’t cause any legal problems…

(I see now. That is true—there’s no way any of those incidents were because of some extraordinary phenomenon. These are manageable as long as you have the time and resources.)
(I had thought it was strange back then, because I couldn’t figure out why anyone would do this, but…)
(I see… So it was to protect a fantasy… In other words, for the sake of “faith”…)
(I don’t believe in that same faith, so to me, it just looked like an unbelievable phenomenon.)

Yep. Aaall of it is to keep up the act that Kanata-san is “an all knowing, extraordinary God who grants wishes.”
“He will grant you anything you wish for”… The scheme exists to achieve that.
And so, as he keeps granting more and more wishes, more people will come to believe that he’s a God.
You too—you almost believed he was before I started explaining things, didn’t you?

…Yes, you’re right. But he’s not a God, right?
I could tell from his body temperature when we made contact. He’s a human being like us, right?

Yup, that’s right. He’s part of a sacred ancestry, yeah, and he is an extraordinary talented kid, but he’s just another human being like us.
Though, he has never had a proper check-up, so I can’t be completely sure about that…
I know the full truth, yet even I have moments where I find it frightening how remarkable he can be.

Mikejima-san… I’ve been wondering; why do you know so much?
The truth that he isn’t a God but actually a human should be something no one should find out about… right?

That’s because I was born in a family that believes in it. My dad’s side of the family has had many generations of people who made sure to protect that faith.
On the front, they’re policemen, and inform the police headquarters that they’re monitoring Kanata-san’s household for being a “possibly suspicious religious family”.
But, in reality… They’re basically just a bunch of worshippers.
I’ve aaalways been a sly little kid, so when I was asked to play with Kanata-san &#39;cause we just so happened to be the same age…
I could tell he wasn’t so different from me through physical contact.
My sister has always been a sickly child since the moment she was born, so in private, I made a wish to Kanata-san to make her healthy…
He agreed, and tried to grant my wish, but my sister was never cured from her chronic disease.
Once I saw that, I realized the truth.
Kanata-san said it was simply because he was still inexperienced at being a God, but that’s absurd.
If you could cure diseases simply by praying to God, then we wouldn’t need any doctors.

…………


Well… Relatedly, I had promised to cure my sister from her disease before making my wish, aaand… it ended up with my sister calling me a liar, and hating me for it.
I made her hope for a way out but betrayed that trust, and made her fall deeper into despair instead… so it’s no surprise she acted that way towards me.
I may have lost my faith then, but there’s still many, maaany people who believe him to be a God.
Even now, this fantasy is only getting stronger, and more stable.
I want you to be aware of this, and ask you to stop yourself from getting involved, please.
Because Kanata-san tried to grant your wish, I researched and learned everything about you, and what I understood from my research is that you really are just a regular, naïve, good kid.
You don’t get any rewards for your hard work, yet you don’t fret over it… you’re ignored and bullied all the time, yet you hold no grudges… You work hard, to the best of your ability, to make your dreams come true.
A good-natured, respectable kid like you is rare these days.
Someone like you doesn’t need a God. It’ll take time, but as long as you work hard, you’ll get what you want.
Relying on a God for these things will only make you dependent on it. The idea that you can just achieve whateeever you want without shedding a single bead of sweat is the way lazy people think.
But, well, people are the type to want to make things easier for themselves. They’ll get attached the moooment they find out that there really is a God who’ll grant their every wish.
But you’re a kid who can work for what you want. If someone like you also fell down this rabbit hole, it’d be a loss to humanity, wouldn’t it? Though, this is a cliché you hear often…
In a future where no one has to learn how to count &#39;cause they can just use a calculator for it, no one would be able to make them anymore, or even have the capability to add 1+1.
And then, society would fall to ruin, or civilization would progress backwards. Hah, do you think it’s amusing that I’m bringing such huge factors like that into this topic?
Because I don’t find it amusing. How I see it, we won’t be reaching the end of the world through a meteorite crashing in, it’ll be through these pile-ups of corruption, one by one… That’ll be the thing that will eradicate everything.
That’s why I’m going to say this to you, specifically. Save the world, ordinary boy.
Don’t ever wish to become a hero—a special being of this world.

…Are you telling me to know my place?

Is that how it sounded to you? Well, you’re mooore or less right, so I won’t ask you to reconsider your thoughts…
Besides, I took a liking to you after just a little research.
I felt envious, y’know? Like, “If only I could live like this~” kinda thing.
I had always wanted to live in the front side of the world, foreeever innocently laughing and enjoying daydreams of Gods and heroes.

…………

And anyway. I keep saying this, but there’s no room for daydreams to exist in this world.
Yet somehow, Kanata-san has been granting wishes unnaturally through “faith” and “mystery”…
And those acts are twisting and bending our reality, which will likely recoil and bring about a great tragedy…
Maybe I’m just overthinking it, but I’m a liiittle scared, y’know?
Like, they’ve touched a really dangerous area with the Kiryu Kuro-san incident, and a few other incidents, too.
Cleaning a pool is not thaaat big a deal, but this time around they’ve actually hurt a bunch of people.
All that bloodshed will forever cling to them. I wasn’t directly involved in that incident though—It was my mother who ordered them to do it.
My mother… to put it short, she’s someone from society&#39;s underground.
Kuro-san seemed worried about this, but some basic ol’ delinquents from the streets are easy to suppress for her, and she’s capable of doing the necessary procedures to make sure they don’t eeever come back for retribution.
My mom’s an expert on violent crime. She’s well aware of how delinquents work, and she knows exactly how to deal with them.
But she isn’t a God, either. There’s no such thing as God in this world. I’m sure there’ll be a few mishaps here and there.
When enough of those pile up, they’ll surely bring about destruction.
That’s why I want you to at least avoid wishing for things to Kanata-san. No matter how much I ask—no matter how hard I try, he’ll probably try to remain a “God”…
That might be what his “happiness” is, but… I’ll do whatever it takes to leave behind a path where he can live as a human being.
If people stop wishing for anything… and if people lose faith in him, he’ll slowly become less of a God. That’s what I want to happen. I’m not wishing for it—I’m expecting it.
I mean… You get what I’m saying, right? He’s a human being, after all.

Translation Notes
↑ Some people have a concern that exercise can stump their physical growth, or even make them shorter.↑ A transformation belt is what a tokusatsu hero (usually a Kamen Rider) uses to transform.↑ Like the previous chapter Keito was in, he was about to refer to Chiaki with kisama (rude “you”), but quickly switches it to kimi to sound more friendly in his next line. It’s a little difficult to show the difference between the two “you”s in English, so in this chapter, I’ve added an asterisk after every line he uses (or was about to use) kisama in.↑ To clarify, the JoJo-like reference is purely coincidental; it just fit the tone Madara was going for.↑ The word used for “myths” is shinpi 神秘, the same word in Ryusei Blue’s catchphrase: The blue flames are the mark of mystery (shinpi). Its literal meaning is “unfathomable mystery.” Also, as an important side note… the first kanji means “God”.]]></content>

Location: Fountain


Time: Present day — End of the year, at night

well then~ i’m off~♪

Mhm! Take care! Be careful on the streets! Call for me if any problems show up!
I’ll come rushing to you in a flash!! Fuhahahaha!! ☆

Ahaha… We’re heading straight home, so I don’t think anything could happen…

Eh, I bet he just wanted to say something heroic…
Well, whatever… (yawns) ♪
I don’t feel right going home when we haven’t even finished cleaning up, but I’m also starting to feel really sleepy, so… I think I’ll take my leave, yeah…

Mhm! Honestly, I should apologize for making you all stay up so late!
I’ll have to apologize to your parents after this, since I kept their precious son in school so late! I must really be worrying them!

Uh, no… I doubt mine are worried at all; I told them about this beforehand anyway…
Besides, whenever I’m lazing around at home during nighttime, they just tell me to go hang out with friends…
You wouldn’t expect it, but my brother would always hang out with his friends back when he was in school…
So, since he was so good at pretty much everything, they scold me when I don’t do things the same way… Or maybe it worries them, I guess…

Ahaha, your brother’s your brother, and you’re you! That’s what I think.

I know, right… It really annoys me to be compared to my older brother over just about anything… I’m jealous of you for being an only child, Tetora-kun…

Really? But I’m jealous of you for having siblings, y’know?


Right, right! I know how you feel, Nagumo! Aaalright, you’re free to call me “Onii-chan~♪” from today onwards…!! ☆

Gyaaa!? Like I said, please stop hugging me at every opportunity~!!
Aren’t you planning to keep on cleaning!? You’ve gotta stop using up your energy already — You’ll collapse, y’know!?

shh… don’t Make a noise, everyone. shinobu will wake up.

zzz…zzz…♪
Mmn… Nyufufu, it is only natural for me to do my duty as a ninja… (mumble mumble)…♪

Ahaha… Sounds like he’s having a nice dream…♪

that’s right. so don’t Wake him up. go to sleep, go to sleep little baby…♪[1]


…♪

Hehe. Kanata, you’re singing him a lullaby while carrying him… I’ve been thinking this often lately, but you’re more of a mama than the one who calls himself one, Mikejima-san.

it doesn’t make me happy to be Compared to that…
well, no matter. we shouldn’t Talk any longer; it’s time to head back Home.
are you sure you’re Fine doing the rest on your own… chiaki?

Of course! I’ll get everything squeaky-clean, so I’ll leave taking the kids home to you… Kanata~♪

yes. you can count on me, chiaki.
first, i must Recover my Energy to properly accomplish my Mission… puka, puka~♪

Mghg—mugaaAAA~!? How cowardly…! But a ninja shall not yield to such torture…! (Cough, cough)!?


Wai—I’ve given up trying to stop you from getting in the fountain, but at least don’t do it while you have Sengoku-kun in your hands!
He’ll drown to death…!!

ahh, i forgot. ehehe, it was an accident, really…♪

Oh jeez… You’re not living all on your own — Don’t just forget about us, please. If you kill Sengoku-kun by “accident,” he won’t be able to rest in peace…

yes! i’m aware! the five of us together are Ryuseitai~♪

… Oh yeah, this reminds me. I heard this from Taishou, but Ryuseitai had a lot of members in the past, right?
Taichou was so eager to tell us how it’s the first time the unit has had five people, so I sorta had the wrong impression at first…
Or like, he just looked so happy when he told us, so I thought, “Oh, I guess I shouldn’t let myself quit this unit then, huh…”

Huh? You’re planning to leave? Reconsider your decision, please! Don’t leave me behind with this group of idiots…!

Nah, I’m not. We’re gonna live and die together~ Although, I did wanna join Akatsuki at first.
But at this point, Ryuseitai is like family to me. Our bond is too deep to break apart, even if I tried.

yes. hehehe~ i’ve made many Families before i knew it… not that i ever Wished for any of it.
god doesn’t Wish for things, after all.
ah, but… that’s right… i’m not a god, am i?
chiaki told me that, but… i had always believed myself as such, so it’s still hard for me to shake off the thought…

…? Um, what do you mean?

do you want to know? if you Wish for it, i’ll grant it… just kidding~♪
actually, no… you should know about it too, shouldn’t you? we’re Family, so we shouldn’t have Secrets between us.
i can also answer tetora’s Question from a moment ago, too.
let’s talk about it. our Story—Ryuseitai’s story.
i’m not Used to these things, so please Tell me if there are any strange things i say.
i don’t know the Full story myself, so i’m sure there will be Many missing parts to the story.
but please, do listen. please, know and understand — about the hero who saved the World.
once upon a time… a Meteorite fell down in some place—

Time: Present day, end of the year

Fuhahaha! Mission accomplished! It’s an incredible victory for Ryuseitai once again…! ☆

yes~♪ this is the Result of everyone’s combined powers! an incredible victory for ryuseitai…!

Kanata…! ♪ (Offers a handshake)

chiaki…! ☆ (Hugs him instead)

Fuhahahaha~! (Both twirl around)

Ughhh… Those two are acting stupidly hyper again… This is so depressing, I wanna die…

Ahaha, maybe their exhaustion has put them in a strangely hyper mood. They said that they had been cleaning nonstop for the entire day.

Whaa? Why would they do a huge cleanup like that again…? Are they trying to escape into the night together…?[1]

Actually, hold on! You two were being so reserved about this! You could’ve told us from the start — We could’ve helped you out!


reserved? like a reservoir? for water? do you want to Talk about water, tetora…!?

N-no! I meant reserved in a different way![2] Please don’t cling to me when you’re in that weird hyper mood, Shinkai-senpai~!?

hehehe~ i’m a Fish, so i will nab at any Bait within my sight… a fish that takes each and every piece of bait, yes yes~♪

Ahaha, I bet you enjoy fishing…
I used to go fishing for black bass with my dad when I was young. But we haven’t been doing it lately, cuz of busy schedules.

waa, really? you should have told me earlier, it would have been an exciting Conversation!
Black Basses aren’t that Tasty, but they’re Fun to fish, yes~? ♪

Umm… This might be a dumb question, but… You call yourself a fish, but you don’t seem to have any problems with catching and eating fish, do you…?

yes, fish are Food, after all~

That sounds like cannibalism to me… Uurgh, I just imagined something terribly graphic.

Heeey! I’d love to chat all night, but it’s dark outside now. We’ve finished our work, so it’s time to withdraw ourselves!
You’ve all done an excellent job today!
Let me embrace each and every one of you as a reward for all your hard work…! ☆

Ah, I’ll pass.

Ahaha, the season has become very chilly — I would love some warmth~
However, please do not make light of us, Taichou-dono. We did not work hard just because we wanted a reward!

Ohh, is that so… ♪ My bad, Sengoku! I wasn’t trying to insult you guys! That’s right, you did this all for the sake of justice, didn’t you!?

It is not just that. It is as you always say, Taichou-dono — All for one, one for all~♪

No matter what the reason is, I’m ecstatic over you three! Over your growth! And the spirit of justice swirling with flame in your hearts…! ☆
Ahh, I can’t hold myself back anymore! I need no reason! I just have to embrace all of you right this instant! I’ll start with you, Nagumooo…! ☆

Gaah--!! Why me!? Please spare us, Taichou! I’m really tired from the huge cleanup work — I don’t wanna use any more of my energy by playing around~!

No problem, no problem at all! Our youth is our strength! As well as something to never fret about! Fuhahahaha! ☆

Owow, owowowow!? Be a little gentle at least, please! If you don’t calm down anytime soon, my karate hands will start erupting fire~!


(whispering) Midori-kun, Midori-kun. Is it just me, or is Taichou-dono acting a little strange today?
(whispering) He is constantly hugging us over anything, like he is far more hyper than usual…?

(whispering) Uh? I’m pretty sure he’s always been like that.
(whispering) Wait, why’re you even asking me… I’m honestly so exhausted, I can’t even use my brain… Shinkai-senpai has been with Morisawa-senpai longer than I am, hasn’t he… You should ask him…

yeees? did you call for me, midori~?

Wha--!? You heard our whispers? You have good hearing, Shinkai-senpai…

do i? hmm, a god is one that hears Everything, you see…?

…? Huh? A God is what? I apologize, Shinkai-dono. You speak with strange intonations, so there are times wherein I cannot comprehend what you are trying to say!

i’m often told~ is my Voice hard to pick up?
i would be Sad if i were misunderstood, so i’ve been trying to talk as Clearly as possible Lately…

No, your voice is very clear, but… Sometimes it’s hard to understand what you’re trying to say, I guess…

i see… it’s lonely when we cannot understand each other…

Ahh, no! We just haven’t been trying hard enough, I think…!? Please don’t make that face, Shinkai-senpai! I’m so sorry for not being able to understand it well…!

hehe. why are you apologizing? you’re a strange Child, Midori~♪
but, i’m Happy to know that you’re trying to Understand me.
you really are similar to how chiaki Used to be.

I get that often for some reason… Honestly, I don’t like being told that, and it only confuses me… I mean, we’re nothing alike, like, aren’t we complete opposites…?
Which part of us is even alike…?

ah—now that you mention it… hmm, i suppose it’s your Kindness?
which means, All you three Children are similar to chiaki… ♪

Yaaay! That is such an honor! But you are also extremely kind, so you resemble him, too! We are all one and the same here in Ryuseitai~♪

… i’m not kind.
gods don’t save Human Beings out of kindness.
that was another thing that chiaki taught me. no… every valuable thing — it was all taught to me by a hero.[3]


Translation Notes
↑ In Japan, it’s common to do an entire cleanup of your house or other before the new year begins.↑ Tetora says 水臭い for “reserved”, which has the water kanji in it, and Kanata jumps on it immediately. I tried to show that in the English translation, too.↑ This story is a great time to mention something about Kanata and the word “hero”: Kanata always talks in full hiragana (he turns katakana words to deformed hiragana spelling). The only word he always says in the correct way it’s spelt is “hero” (ヒーロー, in katakana).]]></content>

Chapter 1
Location: Bulletin Board


Time: One year ago — Beginning of summerDuring breaktime

(Urmmm…)
(Nope, no good. No matter how much I stare at this billboard, nothing new will suddenly appear. The number of jobs to choose from has clearly decreased.)
(I guess we’re in recession, in a way. After all, last year’s graduates had a bad reputation within the industry, so our school’s been getting less job offers.)
(That’s just how society is. They won’t hire incapable people…)
(Even the graduates, who had been doing so well in school, have been retiring from the industry, and disappearing into the void.)
(There are some exceptions, like the super idol Hidaka Seiya, who continues to work in the industry to this day, but…)
(There’s a decline in the industry itself at this point, I think. Idols don’t last very long anymore, it seems.)
(Is everything really going to be alright when it’s like this…? Or has the idol industry become incapable of holding itself up…?)
(Ahh, it all just feels so disheartening…)
(No, no! Don’t think that way! You just have to keep trying to find the good things in life!)
(After all, I still have the stuntman job the previous captain introduced me to, so my own income is alright.)
(Although I’d hoped I could save up money through idol work instead… But that’s a little tricky right now.)
(The previous captain ended up going to the USA as planned, and someone did inherit the Captain role after him, but…)
(I don’t want to badmouth one of my own unit mates, but our current captain is the type who just tries to get through by sucking up to people.)
(He doesn’t seem like he intends to work properly as an idol — all he’s good at is cutting corners.)
(Mikejima-san has been appointed vice-captain, and for some reason, the captain pretends to work hard only when he’s around… other than that, he just plays around.)
(After we became second-years, Mikejima-san has been travelling overseas even more than before for some reason…)
(So whenever he’s not around, everyone starts doing whatever they want, like they’re trying to vent out their pent-up grudges.)
(Some members couldn’t even tolerate stopping themselves from messing around, so they’ve been transferring to Chess instead, where everyone messes around all the time, whenever they feel like.)
(Ryuseitai is losing both value and people.)
(I do want to stop this, but nothing I say has any influence. I feel like they start to treat me even worse, instead.)


(But I can’t complain at all… Last year, when everyone got serious for a while… apparently, that was because of my “wish”.)
(Apparently, to grant my wish, Shinkai-kun got Mikejima-san involved, since he was already in Ryuseitai… and that’s how the unit turned out the way it did last year.)
(Yeah, that makes sense… Not only the previous captain, but everyone else had suddenly changed their attitudes, too. Like it was magic… Like a miracle…)
(It all happened because that’s what that kid called “God” wanted.)
(I asked Mikejima-san to tell Shinkai-kun to stop doing anything like that anymore, so…)
(It would only be absurd to “wish” for the same thing yet again.)
(Threatening the lazy members to force them to work hard would be awful, anyway…)
(It is frustrating, and it is lonely, but I have no other choice… Enough relying on other people — I’ll do what I can by myself.)
(I’ll never wish for anything ever again.)
(This world has no room for daydreams, so I just have to do what I can, as hard as I can.)
(That would be enough, wouldn’t it, Mikejima-san?)
(Shinkai-kun… You may think it’s unfortunate that you couldn’t get me to wish for something—)
(And if that would make you sad, then I do feel a little bad refusing to do so, but—)
(I’m really sorry. I don’t think I could protect your smile.)


Heey~
Sorry, but you’re in my way, so~ Move, Morisenpai.

Woah—! Oh, Akehoshi-kun! Hello! I’ve told you this so many times by now, but it’s not “Mori”, I’m Morisawa!

Oh, right. Sorry, sorry, I just call anyone I’m not interested in whatever comes to mind.

No interest!? That’s mean!
Ah, but Senpai thinks your honesty is a good thing! Let me praise you, come on over, c’mon, c’mon… ♪

Don’t call me over like a dog. You really are a weirdo, Morisenpai…

Like I said, I’m Morisaw—oh well… Anyway, is there something I can do for you?
Do you get anxious if you don’t see me at least once a day? Ooh, you little~♪

Nope, not one bit. I’m just here to check if there’s any job offers. Are you doing the same thing, Senpai?

Yup! But as you can see, the number of them is decreasing.

Oh, is that so… Ahh, that puts me in a bind~ I mean, all I’ve been doing is solo activity lately.
But since the in-school jobs are based on that “DreamFes” thing, I can’t get any of them as a solo idol anymore.

Hm. So you aren’t part of a unit? Then how about Ryuseitai? You’re always welcome with open arms!

Ehh~ Isn’t your unit just a bunch of lazy bums?
Everyone in a unit gets equally rewarded, so I bet they’d just mooch off of all my hard work.
I don’t see the point in teaming up with people if it’s going to be that way. Me and my mom’re in a rough spot financially right now; I wanna make as much money as I can.
If I don’t start making money, my mom’ll have to work harder than she can handle.

I see… That must be rough. If you’re alright with doing stunt work, I could introduce you to the place I work at; how about it?

Mm, nah… I wanna make my way in life as an idol.
I mean, I won’t have any other choice if my situation gets bad enough, but~ I can make do with solo work at the moment.
So don’t worry about it. ‘Kay, I’ll see ya later~ Just spotted a nice job, so I’m gonna head over there and check it out.

Ooh, you’ve got keen eyesight! You could become a great basketball player! Come visit the Basketball Club sometime, Akehoshi-kun.

Yeah, if I feel like it~ Bye bye now, Morisawasenpai!

(Oh! He called me by my name. The way he said it sounded weird, though…)
(He’s usually cold and distant, like a wild animal… But he still listens to what I say.)
(Ahh, it makes me happy~ Juniors are so nice to have…)
(Aaalright! I’m going to work hard too, so I can become a proud senior! ♪)
(Hang in there! Don’t lose now, Morisawa Chiaki!)

Chapter 2
Location: Gym


Time: Same day, after classes

Bam! Take this! Finishing move: Super Chiaki Shoot…!! ☆
Heh… One point for me! Justice always prevails!

… Huh, you sure talk to yourself a lot, Morisawasenpai.

Eeek!? D-d-d-don’t scare me like that, Akehoshi-kun! When did you get here!? It’s rude to sneak up behind people! I thought I was going to die!

Hm~? Dying from shock? Are you a little animal or somethin’~?
Hehe, it’s all good, though. It’s cute.

Hmph! How could you say “cute” to your senior!? You’re so cheeky! But I guess you’re complimenting me, so in a sense, thank you!
Anyway… What’s wrong? Are you going to join club activities today? Didn’t you say you found a job earlier today, though…?

Whaa~ You’re the one who told me to show up sometimes.
… I rejected the job offer after learning the details.

R-Really? Why is that? Did they say something bad to you!? You poor thing! Let me make you feel better!

Nope. When I went there, they asked me to be the substitute for someone I dunno~ I mean, it would’ve been fine if it were something similar to a pinch hitter, but—
I wasn’t just gonna be said person’s substitute, they wanted me to work in the “background”—Basically, they wanted me to hide my face in a radio show and imitate his voice… Like, they were asking for way too much.
Well, technically I can do that, since the person in question is a pretty famous idol, and I more or less get how his character works, but…

Hm. I’m only asking out of curiosity, but who may you be referring to?
You don’t have to tell me if it’s confidential, but — I feel like I’ve heard something like this before, so I’m sort of curious.
If I remember clearly, he’s a famous idol who works solo, and goes by the name Hi… Hi-something[1], wasn’t it…?

Hmm, they did tell me to keep it secret, but… I didn’t sign a contract or anything, so I guess it’s okay to tell you…
Or maybe not, since it may affect his reputation… I’m gonna keep it to myself.

Alright then. You respect people’s reputation, huh? I’m proud of you for being so considerate~♪

Umm, it doesn’t make me happy being complimented by you~…
Anyways. Now that I’ve got free time, I figured I could come over to the club to kill some time.
I didn’t bring my P.E. uniform, though. If you have a spare with you, could you let me borrow it?

Oh! I’ve got something great for that! I was just planning to change myself! You see, we have uniforms for practicing!
Which number would you like? You can choose any of them! Ah—but I’m not handing over number four, okay!?[2]

I don’t mind anything~ … So there were practice uniforms? Is that normal for a Basketball Club? I’m a beginner, so I dunno much.

No, it’s pretty rare. Usually you only wear a uniform during a match.
But since this is a Basketball Club in an idol school, there was once a time when a magazine company wanted to take candid shots for an article, so…
Now we have practice uniforms—or, well, uniforms for photos.

Ahh, I see, the photos wouldn’t be good enough in P.E. uniforms, yeah? It’s actually pretty hard to tell this is a Basketball Club without someone at least holding the ball.

Exactly! You’re really smart, Akehoshi-kun! You understand things so well, it’s wonderful~♪

I feel like you praise me over just about anything… It’s super overbearing, like you’re making fun of me instead.

That’s not my intention at all~! … I’ve never once been praised by my seniors, so I thought to make sure to pour all my love into my juniors once I had my own!

Hmm~ So you’ve always been a useless one, Senpai?

I’m not useless, though!? No, actually, the “always” part is what hurts! I mean, regardless of how I may had been in the past, I’ve at least grown splendidly now!
C’mon, c’mon~! Look at my wonderfully built abs…☆

Huh!? Why’re you stripping!? I’ll call the police!

Please don’t! I said I’d change my clothes, didn’t I!?
You went too far with that joke; Senpai would love a kid who’s much more honest and attached to them, y’know!?

I don’t wanna be loved by you, anyway~ … But alright, maybe I was a little too mean. Sorry, sorry~ It’s just becoming so much fun to tease you~♪

Chapter 3
Location: Front Gate


Time: Few hours later

Aaalright! Time to head home, Akehoshi-kun!
Let’s check if it’s safe! Right’s all clear! Left’s all clear! All is clear! Here we gooo~! ☆

Umm~… You don’t have to walk me back home, y’know. I told you before — My house isn’t that far away.

No! Let me walk you back home, please! I’ve yearned to do something like this as a senior…! Thank you, Akehoshi-kun! You always make my dreams come true~♪

Huh? You were talking to me much more politely just a second ago; why’d you suddenly start being more casual?[3]
Don’t start shortening the distance between us for no reason~ It’s way too friendly, like you think you’re above me or something — It annoys me!

Huh? I’m sorry! I thought talking to you that way made me seem cold, like we don’t know each other…!

We don’t. But whatever~ Do as you like.

Mhm, I will~! It’s dangerous to walk at night, so we’ll go home together~! C’mon, c’mon! Let’s walk while holding hands~♪

I didn’t say you could do that! Stay, stay! You’re so overbearing, oh my God…!


… Senpai, did you…
About me—no, about my dad[4], you—…
No, nevermind.

Hm? What’s wrong? If there’s anything you want to say, go ahead and say it!
I’m still new to being a senior to someone, so I’m sure I’m far from perfect as one! I’ll fix anything you point out to me!

Mm~ Shouldn’t you say that to the juniors in your unit, instead?

Ah, no… No first years joined our unit this year.
Ryuseitai has a long history, and thanks to its old-fashioned camaraderie, the unit became a bit reclusive.
And, well, it’s gotten even worse this year.
The new captain is the type to be satisfied by just having fun with like-minded people. He hasn’t bothered to scout new members, and even drives away anyone he can’t stand.

Woah! What kinda hell is that…!? It doesn’t suit you at all! Why’re you sticking around in a place like that? There’s no way you agree with that, right?

Yeah… Honestly, I’ve often considered transferring to a different unit, or maybe just leaving units altogether and working solo, but… I can’t get myself to entirely give up on the whole unit…
Ryuseitai is my exact ideal image, since originally its concept was to be both idols and heroes.
Also, maybe the previous captain was just being nice, but he encouraged me. His words to me were: “I leave the rest to you,” and “hang in there.”
And then he told me, “become a great hero.” He patted me on the back and head, and I guess he must’ve been weirdly energetic that day, because then, for once, he hugged me.
Right at that moment, I felt like I had inherited the spirit of Ryuseitai—the very first idol unit to have been established in Yumenosaki Academy—
Like I inherited the burning, passionate spirit of justice. … Ryuseitai is corrupted right now, no doubt about it. But the lazy members who do as they please are all third years.
Once they graduate… The next captain will be Mikejima-san, if we’re looking at who has the skills for it.
I don’t really understand him very well, and he’s kind of terrifying, but he does his job well, has a good reputation overseas, and has a record of his accomplishments.
We’ll make him the next captain, and then we’ll do as best as we can to support him, and… If we work hard, I’m sure Ryuseitai will be reborn. Next year’s when the real game begins—no, that’s when it’ll be our turn!
That’s what I believe in. There’s hope for the future, so I can bear with anything that comes my way!

Hmmm. I feel like you’re avoiding the real problem here, or like, you’re trying to come up with excuses.
I mean, all I hear about Ryuseitai is bad news. If things don’t go well, the school’s staff might have their eyes on you, or the unit’ll be demolished by next year, or something.

Don’t say such terrifying things… It’ll be just fine. No—I’ll make sure that doesn’t happen. I promise you: I will protect Ryuseitai.

I don’t think there’s much point to promising me that, but… Well, do as you like. It’s your life, Senpai.
… Hey, if Ryuseitai really is reborn next year… and if you’re still up for that offer by then, and I still haven’t been able to do any work except solo…
Invite me then, okay? I might agree to join if anything like that were to happen.

Oh!? Got it! That’s our promise to each other! Believe in me, Akehoshi-kun! A hero never breaks his promise with a kid!

Huuuh? When did you become a hero, Morisawasenpai?
Also, don’t tell me the “kid” is me. We’re only a year apart, ‘kay? Gosh, you act so high and mighty…
… But that’s okay. If only a hero really had existed when I was in the worst time of my life…
… Hm?

? What’s wrong?

Uh… Look up there, Senpai. Is it just me, or is it a little too bright up on the roof? I thought there was a fire for a second there.

Hmm? You have such keen eyesight, Akehoshi-kun! And your attentiveness is incredible! You really do have what it takes to be an excellent basketball pla—Wait, what?
(Ooh? What are those people wearing our school uniform doing on the rooftop? Are they waving light sticks…?)
(Is there a live show happening? No, wait, but… I don’t think anyone is allowed on the rooftop late at night, so…?)

Ahh~ Is that the rumored “Yaobikuni”…? This is the first time I’ve seen them.

Y-Yaobikuni? The legendary story about eating mermaid flesh and becoming immortal?

Ah, no, I don’t actually know what it’s about. It’s just the rumor recently, I think. Sakasaki-kun’s in my class, see—He knows a lot about weird stuff like that.
He’s one of the few friends I have that I can casually talk to, so we have chats sometimes.
That’s when he told me that there’s an illegal circle called “Yaobikuni” in our school.
I dunno how much of it is true, but apparently they’re a religious cult or some secret group.
What was his name again…? Ah! Someone called “Shin kai ka na ta” is acting as the founder of the group.

Huh!? Shinkai-kun is the…!?

Oh? Do you know him? Yeah, he’s that… What was it, Five Eccentrics?
He’s one of the people who’re called by that name — They’re the most excellent, outstanding idols in this school, yeah~?
Well, the Five Eccentrics are just outstanding idols — I doubt any of them are actually cult leaders, or Gods, or whatever…
Buuut, those are the kinda rumors you hear.
People talking about how it’s totally true that that “Shin kai ka na ta” guy will grant any of your wishes.

Location: Rooftop


Time: A few days later, after classes

……
(… Yeah, there’s definitely signs that a huge number of people have been conducting secret meetings here. What I witnessed a few days ago was no illusion or dream.)
(It doesn’t give off the sense that it’s been used as a gathering place for delinquents, either. Although unfortunately, there are people like that in this school.)
(I’m already aware of that, since they always throw litter all over the ground. I couldn’t stand seeing the place littered, so I typically clean this area.)
(But, those “Yaobikuni” people… Something feels off about them.)
(No one is supposed to go to the rooftop of the academy, which may be why it’s starting to look a bit dirty around here. This also means footsteps are left behind.)
(Yet, these people have been wiping their traces off the ground before leaving.)
(But the fact that the ground is so clean next to everything else is what makes it so obviously unnatural.)
(There&#39;s even a sweet lingering scent left behind.)
(It doesn’t smell like candy or juice, so what is it… Incense sticks, maybe? It can’t be tobacco—Maybe it’s musk?)
(It makes me think of those aromas used for religious purposes!)
(It’s just too suspicious! What’s going on? Who are these Yaobikuni people?)
(What are they doing in the corners of our school?)
(Is Shinkai-kun really acting as their founder…?)
(Why? How did that happen? I don’t understand, and that makes me feel all the more uneasy!)
(……)
(… What am I even doing…? No one asked me to do this, yet I’m acting like a detective just because I’m a little curious.)
(Mikejima-san even warned me to not get involved—to not dig any deeper into this…)
(And I doubt me of all people could ever make a difference simply by fumbling around.)
(But… I just can’t help wondering what’s going on. I can’t get myself to overlook this.)
(Mikejima-san… I also think it’s terrible that a human being is being pushed into the role of a God.)
(This may be unnecessary of me, and maybe this is just me being foolish, and having a narrow-minded point of view…)
(And maybe what I’m doing right now is just me trying to look cool, like a middle schooler playing the hero role, but…)[5]
(But still, I—)
(… Hm? Over there, in the far corner…)
(That person in the garden… Isn’t that Shinkai-kun?)
(I ended up in a different class from him this year, too. After what happened last year, I felt like I had to avoid him, and haven’t talked to him since…)
(Which is just proof that I don’t know a single thing about what he’s been going through, or what he’s thinking, but…)
(I should still go talk to him — I can ask him everything I want to know… Mikejima-san may get angry at me for this, but I want to do it.)
(That kid granted my wishes, like a shooting star. It was all nothing but lies and fabrication[6] done by his worshippers, but…)
(I still would like to repay his kindness. If he’s suffering from something, then I want to save him.)
(All I did was spray some water at him, and be a little nice to him… Yet he laughed so innocently, like it was the very first time he’s ever had someone do that for him.)

……

… Kanata.

yes? what is it, shu?
that was your Name, right? you have a Name, all of you! hehehe~…♪
and so! because my Name is shinkai kanata, you called me “Kanata”, yes? am i right?

Yes, you’re correct. However, I still don’t understand what you’re trying to say.
It is painfully clear to me that you have had quite a unique lifestyle for half of your lifetime, but how does that have anything to do with me? I don’t see where this conversation is heading.

huh? it is Painful for you? shall i cure you? curing is my Weakest point, though…?
ah! i heard Mermaid flesh works for all kinds of Diseases! how about you try eating me~? ♪

I have no interest in cannibalism! Non! I feel like puking just by the thought!

puking…? so not only is it Painful for you, but it is making you feel Disgusted…? are you Feeling ill?

Chapter 5

Kanata. I will try my best to allow the lot of you to do as you please—or rather, I’ve come to understand just through our very short acquaintanceship, that anything I say to any of you is futile.
However, as you can see, I am currently sewing.
I am not so amateur that a gaze would interfere with the quality of my work, but frankly speaking… You are being an eyesore.

an eyesore? that is Not good, there may be a Possibility that even your Eyes are not Feeling well! you have many Diseases all over your body, don’t you, shu?

Are you doing this on purpose, is that it? Are you trying to provoke me?

on purpose? about what? hmm… the Things shu says are difficult~

People often say that about me. However, you are different from the ordinary masses, are you not? You are intelligent enough to comprehend the meaning behind my words, correct?
Surely you must, as you are of equal rank to me… as we are both part of the Five Eccentrics, the name that was pushed onto us by the masses—yes?

yes. to be part of something together means that we are the same, right?
hehehe. it makes me Happy to share something in Common…♪

I am not the least bit happy about it. I, Itsuki Shu, am at the top of all creations—a transcendence that no other may stand next to.
Being grouped with four more people for being similar makes me feel like my worth among the mass is underestimated. It is unpleasant.
Especially you—You act so high and mighty.
Usually, it is that nagging Wataru and Rei that make idle talk, so the two of us rarely ever speak one on one, like we are doing right now.
But everytime you speak, you start spouting things about being a God, that you grant wishes, or what-have-you… Who do you think you are? Do you think you’re a savior of some sort—that you have been dispatched by the high heavens to rescue all living things?

hm? it is not the Heavens that i come from~ it is the Sea! also, i am not a Savior, but a God♪
because i am a God, i grant Wishes! shu, what is your Wish?

… You really aren’t listening to me at all, are you?
You’ll grant my wish? Ha! Don’t make me laugh! That’s something one only says to those they think are below them. Are you trying to say that you are above me?

hm~? are Humans not generally Below me? which is why i can watch over them from Above, and Help them…?

… I will skip past the nerve you hit just now — I simply pity you at this point. I will make this very clear to you: I do not plan to have faith in anyone but myself.
I suppose if I must specify something, then I do have a longing towards muses.
However, that description is more suitable to someone such as Nito — You, on the other hand, would be more comparable to a siren, no?

psy…che…?[7]

Not psyche, siren. It may only be folktale, but they are said to be mermaids.
Muses and sirens may be mythical creatures related to water, but sirens are monsters—far different from my beloved muses.[8]

i am… not a Monster, you know…?

… Such an unbearably sad face you’re making. I cannot tell where your discomforts lie at all. Perhaps that was not the right word choice, I suppose I’ll withdraw what I said.

okay. you are Unexpectedly kiー
… hm?

? What’s wrong? Have those insolent, belated people who called for us finally arrived? I mean the other Eccentrics, of course.

no, it is nothing… the sun was too bright, and… i think i may have Mistaken something for something else. i am sorry.
(i thought i saw chiaki, but…)
(it must have been a mistake. i think he is Afraid of me, so…)

(he will probably never Talk to me ever again… i am sure you are just the same as Everyone besides the five Eccentrics—you, too, are—)

Location: Garden Terrace


……
(… Why did you hide, me!?)
(Ahh, he’s leaving… Seems like he’s meeting up with the rest of the Eccentrics to go hang out somewhere…)
(He looks like he’s having fun walking side-by-side with them.)
(… When those five are together, it really does make a spectacular sight. It has a beauty to it… It makes sense, since they’re the most favored kids of this generation, and they’re currently at the pinnacle of our school…)
(They’re living in a much different world from me, while I’m just someone from low class struggling to get by.)
(I feel the distance between us… And I’m starting to feel like I’m being extremely dumb right now… I mean, he’ll be fine without me doing anything, won’t he…?)
(I may just be getting anxious about all of this for no reason whatsoever… Maybe I’m just losing track of what’s reality and what’s fantasy after burying myself in way too many stories…)
(That’s why I’m getting way too worried, and start running around in circles from panic—)
(I really am nothing but an idiot.)
(Besides, even if this horrid situation continues to get worse… It’ll be alright, won’t it?)
(Shinkai-kun, you have comrades you can rely on, don’t you?)
(You have friends equal to you—the Five Eccentrics… And you also have Mikejima-san, who said he’d do your bidding…)
(All those people are a million times cooler, better, and stronger than me.)
(As long as they&#39;re around, you should be fine, right? You don’t need me saving you, right…?)

Time: Next day, after classes

—And that’s all I’ve got to report. What’s your next move, Bocchan?

First, stop calling me that. You switched to a different name for a while, but now you’re back to the first one for some reason.
How incorrigible. I suppose that’s meant to be a nickname, but I just feel like you’re making a fool of me instead. I don’t particularly like it.

Haha, then what should I call ya? Vice-prez? Kei-chan?

Call me whatever you like. I’m already asking a huge favor from you for this plan, so I prefer to respect your free will to some extent.
Do be aware that I’m not trying to control you, but rather trying to let you make use of the Student Council as you please.

Hmmm. And what can this newborn, shabby-lookin’ Student Council even do for me, eh?

What I can offer you for now is authority. If I make everything that you’re doing part of the Student Council’s duties, then it will become a part of justice.
And it’s unlikely that you will misuse what is labeled as “justice,” correct? I trust you on that part.
Or rather, I’m trying to take advantage of your good, sensible mind, and restrain your movement because I know you won’t misuse it.

Haha. You sure you wanna tell me all about your ulterior motives?

Based on everything I know about you, I’ve concluded that the best way to ask for your help is to tell you my real intentions from the start, rather than trick you into helping me.
We may end up being together for a long while, after all. I’m looking at the bigger picture here, since I’d like to properly advance my plans according to what will become useful in the long run.
I just need to win the game by the end. Perseverance is what prevails, and that’s why I’ve been building up my assets slowly, but surely.
(However, as for Eichi… He doesn’t know how long he has left to live, due to his weak constitution… Thus, he may be appalled by how I’m taking my sweet time with this plan. Actually—He might even curse at me for it.)
(Still, I won’t be able to make any real progress by rushing the plan—I’m only human, after all.)
(I would be left with nothing in my hands, and all of it would go to waste.)
(That’s what I learnt after what happened with Sakuma-san.)
(Don’t rush, don’t panic… Take deep breaths in between…♪)


Forgive me for intruding. Hasumi-dono, could you permit me to speak?

…!? Ahh, you surprised me! You were here, Kanzaki!?

Yes, I have been here from the start. I believe that Kiryu-dono was aware of my presence…
However, you both appeared to be speaking very earnestly about something, so I did not wish to intrude, and refrained from expressing my thoughts.

Haha, I was wonderin’ why you were ignorin’ him… So you didn’t even realize he was there, Hasumi?

So you’re going to call me by my family name? Fine, so be it… Anyhow, Kanzaki — You’re a member of Akatsuki, too. You don’t need to constantly ask for permission to speak.
We are equal in this unit. Rather, all human beings are meant to be equal to each other. There is no need to speak to me in a formal manner, like you’re a samurai serving your lord.

… I see. It appears that I have actually been disrespectful through my asking for permission. I apologize. But I also cannot help it; I am not used to acting as a group.
More importantly, I wish to inquire about the mysterious group that Kiryu-dono has informed us of, the “Yaobikuni”.

Ahh, are you also curious about it? It didn’t seem to be a mere superstition…
Thus, I asked Kiryu to investigate what’s been happening, as he has connections with the delinquents in this academy.

Ah, yeah. Sometimes I ask for some stuff from shady jobs, though those jobs have also become a part-time thing within school.
So yeah, I’d have more connections with those shady guys than you, the goodie-two-shoes honor student.
… If Akatsuki and the Student Council are meant to be “justice,” then should I cut my ties with those guys?
My history with them might end up being a weak point to target for the Student Council, y’know?

No, it’s alright. That would be far too unnecessary.

Haha, alright, but if that ever happens, you can throw away the punks, includin’ me.

I have no plans to do that. Besides, the dark and light of this world are blended with each other.
I’m not so happy-go-lucky that I would dream of an ideal paradise where all evil has been extinguished. I’m not a kid, you know.
I—We need you. I’ve lived all my life in an upstanding manner, and that’s exactly why I need someone like you, who can reach those places I’m not well-acquainted with, and can’t reach on my own.

That so? Well, being needed doesn’t feel so bad. I appreciate it, makes me wanna cry a li’l bit.

Hehe, so even demons[9] shed tears. Though, I do admit that your discussion right now was a little too difficult for me to comprehend.

Don’t think about it too much, it’s only small talk. That aside—You’re interested in the Yaobikuni, Kanzaki? Don’t tell me you’re also a worshipper.

Mm, a “worshipper”? Is this “Yaobikuni” related to a religion of some sort?

Seems like it. It ain’t an officially recognized group in school or anythin’; it sounds like it’s some kinda network that somehow just came to be.

Co-translated with: haranami
Chapter 7
Content Warning: Mentions of violence ahead.


Yes. You see, the Yaobikuni don’t appear to have proper headquarters of any sort.
They are simply a large society, keeping in contact with each other for essential information, done through encrypted text messages.
There seems to be no need to perform a ritual, nor pay a fee to join the group.
I’m sure there must be people who aren’t even aware that they’re part of the Yaobikuni due to this.

Hmm… It is like trying to grasp a cloud.

Exactly. There does appear to be someone at the center of the group who is currently acting as the religious founder for them, but…
He doesn’t seem to have any intention of creating or managing the organization.
It seems to be nothing but the group simply prancing around him however they please.
They don&#39;t seem to be doing anything terrible at the moment—the only exceptions are the fervent ones trespassing onto the school rooftop, but that&#39;s a trivial violation.
So we could just leave them aside for now, but—
They’re starting to grow much too large to ignore, and their bizarre and illogical movements make me uneasy.
I don’t particularly like how it feels like the academy is being slowly taken over by an unknown group of people.
… Cursed cult. They’re so infuriating — Our modern society doesn’t need any religions.

Haha, you’re one to talk, Mr. “I’m the son of a temple”.

I’m saying this because I am one. I know how frightening religions can be. Though for now, it appears to be nothing but a substitute for one—a secret “good luck charm”, if you will.
But, at worst, this may become a large obstruction in our path. After all, the ones the student body should trust is us, the Student Council.
… Maybe I should nip the bud before it sprouts a disaster…

How, though? We’ve got no real authority to do that — You gonna try and change the rules to ban believin’ in religious faith in school?

No, students should be free to have faith as they please. Also, the Student Council has an insignificant amount of authority, so we won’t get anywhere trying to change the school rules.
Everyone would simply ignore them, and it would be all over for us.
There is no point trying to provoke the worshippers without planning beforehand.

That’s gonna be annoyin’, then… Can’t we just beat up the bad guy and get this done and over with?
… Nah, we can’t, can we… Nothin’s that simple.

…?

(The same could be said about what happened with Morisawa.)
(Last year, I made the mistake of thinkin’ Morisawa beat up my pals, and lashed out at him. Man, I must’ve been out of my mind then.)
(I mean, if you think about it… There’s no freakin’ way a frail guy like him could manage that.)
(I should’ve realized that, but I still went and freaked him out by blamin’ it all on him… When he didn’t even do anything wrong.)
(He was just worried about me, carin’ for me after seeing me wounded all over…)
(I was such a goddamn idiot. I’m sorry, Morisawa.)
(I tried gettin’ in touch with my pals in secret to get an idea of who was behind everything… But all I got to know is that it definitely wasn’t Morisawa.)
(I dunno who went ahead and beat up a bunch of punks, and why they would, but—)
(I regretted what I did to Morisawa so bad… so I tried to punish the guys in Ryuseitai for bullyin’ him.)
(I was so angry at myself, I felt so pathetic—I needed a way to vent it all out, badly.)
(But even that was stupid of me to do. Morisawa got angry at me[10], tellin’ me how I’m an “absolute idiot”…)
(Ahh, I really am an absolute freakin’ idiot. I can’t even retaliate… But I just dunno any other way to deal with things like this. What was I supposed to do, ma?)
(Can a delinquent ever truly learn his lesson? Am I just goin’ to keep on makin’ the same mistake over and over…?)
(I joined Akatsuki just ‘cuz Hasumi scouted me, and now I’m pretendin’ to be all about justice and whatnot…)
(But no amount of clothes could ever change who I really am. I bet I’ll just hurt someone again…)
(I can’t trust myself.)
(I think I kinda get how those Yaobikuni guys feel… You start wishin’ you could just depend on someone above you to know what to do in life.)

… Kiryu? What’s wrong? Are you feeling ill?
Sorry. I keep asking far too much of you.

Huh? Don’t act like we’re strangers here. I would&#39;a told you by now if this was too much for me, anyway. I’m helpin’ ya ‘cuz I want to, aight? You lookin’ down on me or somethin’?

Yes. I feel the same as Kiryu-dono — there is no need for you to be concerned. It would not be an apology, but rather an insult, Hasumi-dono.
In any case, I would like to propose an idea.
Would you please entrust this “Yaobikuni” matter to me? I, Kanzaki Souma, shall handle it.

… Entrust it to you?

Oh? Got an idea or somethin’, Kanzaki?
I don’t feel like there’s much anyone could do about this vague problem of ours, but — did you get a breakthrough to solvin’ it or somethin’?

Ah, no. I am uncertain whether I will be capable of resolving the issue or not. It is merely that I have ties to the founder of that “Yaobikuni” group.

Founder… You know Shinkai Kanata of the Five Eccentrics!?

Indeed. My interpersonal interactions with him are almost nonexistent, but as our families are connected, I do know a little about him.
The things I have heard about him were a bit too different from what my parents have told me, so I have only just made the connection now.
I know the person called Shinkai Kanata.
I hold a different perspective than the one you two hold, and therefore I may be able to solve the issue… that is what I am thinking. According to all of our ancestors, a thief is required to catch a thief, correct?

Chapter 8
Location: Front Gate


(……)
(My worst nightmare came true. Those “Yaobikuni” people really are what I vaguely assumed them to be.)
(To this day, Shinkai-kun is still granting wishes.)
(He listens to other people’s wishes by talking to them, just like he did with me — and always makes sure to grant each and every one of them.)
(He will fairly, indiscriminately grant all wishes… and nothing can stop him from doing so.)
(He keeps on going from one wish to another, no matter who it is.)
(Any wishes that he himself can grant would be done on the spot… For instance, wishing to be patted on the head.)
(When they can’t be achieved by him alone, many of his worshippers will be ready to act—)
(And use any means necessary to grant those wishes.)
(Getting a strict teacher fired for warning a student, taking down a fast food restaurant because they didn’t like how a cashier spoke to them—)
(Driving a kid home specifically through an expensive car because he missed the last train, buying and then giving away multiple copies of a new game console on the same day it releases…)
(I only searched around a little, and still managed to find plenty of stories.)
(I don’t think anybody was warned to keep it a secret, because there are all kinds of stories spread around on public social media accounts.)
(Once people hear about those rumors, they start getting curious about these wishes… and some have a prayer in their heart beforehand, leading them to tell their wishes to Shinkai-kun.)
(Even the people who laughed at the thought of someone being capable of doing this started to change their minds once they saw those wishes come true.)
(Nobody can stop themselves from wishing for more… and it keeps piling up.)
(And with every type of wish being granted, nobody wants to try working hard on their own—they’re all starting to believe that life is easier when you make a wish to Shinkai-kun.)
(They become hollow versions of themselves, and depend on him for everything. And that kept on repeating, until it got stronger, expanded further, until it formed into what you can only call a “religion”.)
(No… This religion existed within this region from the old times. They’re simply being taken in by those strange worshippers Mikejima-san was talking about.)
(Is that Shinkai-kun’s goal?)
(Is it to gain more worshippers, so that there are more people to worship him as a living God?)
(Shinkai-kun. Is that your true wish?)
(If so, then I don’t want to reject it. I can’t say I want to support it, but I at least don’t want to get in your way… But—)
(In a world that has no room for daydreams to exist, something coming true simply by wishing for it is too unnatural.)
(Every time that reality is ignored to grant a wish — In other words, every time someone gains something, someone else is losing something without reason.)
(Those who lose something will only bear a bitter grudge. They’ll try to find out how this happened, and they’ll find their way to Shinkai-kun.)
(And then, from their rage and need for revenge, they may hurt him.)
(… He hasn’t even done anything wrong. All he’s been doing is granting “wishes”…)


Heeeey! Chiaki-saaaan!

…!? M-Mikejima-san! You always appear out of nowhere! It’s bad for my heart!

Hahaha! It’s not like I wanna scare people or anything, but eeevery time I greet someone, they get jumpy for some reason.
…Am I really that scary?

Urmm… You’re noisy and massive, so it’s not strange to feel pressured by your presence, I think. Still, what are you doing here?

Hahaha! Isn’t it obvious!? I’m running a roasted onigiri stall! I’m using a special secret soy sauce for it, and it’s suuuper tasty! Wanna buy one?

Why roasted onigiri…? I don’t understand, but I’m a little hungry right now, so I’ll have one.

Thank you, come again! I was feeling a liiittle lonely, y’know! I think everyone’s weirded out by a random stall right at the front gate or something, ‘cause they’ve been ignoring me entirely!
Roasted onigiri is so tasty, though~ I guess youngsters these days prefer hamburgers and stuff?

Hehe, I also like those types of fast food. Plus, you don’t see people sell onigiri in food stalls, do you?

Seeeriously? But it’s been Japan’s version of fast food for centuries now! Even sushi was sold like this back in the old days, y’know?
Oh well, guess no one’s familiar with that nowadays. I gotta keep up with the modern times, too—especially now that we’ve become westernized since the Meiji era.
But aaanyway… I didn’t have any customers up until now, so I didn’t bother making any roasted onigiri yet… You’ll have to wait some time for yours.

Yeah, I’ll wait. No one is motivated to do anything in Ryuseitai when you aren’t around, so I don’t have practice nor work to do.
I have time to spare, so I can wait as long as it takes.

Oh? Alright then… How about we chat a little until it’s done roasting?

…?

Ahh, just pretend to be my customer for now.
We don’t know who could be watching us right now, so keep acting like you’re a passerby who’s just caaasually chatting with the storekeeper.

A-Alright. Yaaay~ I’m sooo excited for my roasted onigiri…♪
(whispering) …Were you waiting for me, Mikejima-san? Did you have something you wanted to tell me? Is that why you brought over this authentic food stall—

Chapter 9

Naaah, this is an actual interest of mine, and I figured I could make a profit from it.
People overseas looove authentic Japanese food, so sometimes I sell it while doing investigations.
I just figured I could call out to you, that’s all—It didn’t matter much to me if I couldn’t get to see you today.
Don’t think too deep on this, I’m honestly not expecting anything from you.
You may be good-natured, but you’re just an ordinary boy. I’m not gonna start depending on you for things like you’re some hero or God.
After all, it’s me who wished for you to just remain an ordinary boy, yeah?
I’m not gonna take back those words. Actually, I wanted to further state how you shouldn’t get yourself involved with what’s going on with Kanata-san.

……

Oh, but don’t get me wrong—I’m not taking you lightly at all. In fact, I’ve compleeetely changed my opinion of you; I think very highly of you now.
…You were the only one.

…?

You were the only one who did as I said when I asked you not to wish for anything.
And you were the very first person who never spoke a word about any wish to Kanata-san, even after how he introduced himself to you.
I mean, even I wished for something once—for my sister’s disease to be cured.
Humans are weak. It’s normal for people to wish for something—to pray for some almighty being to make a miracle happen and make their lives better.
Even people who insist they’re atheists wish on shooting stars.
In a way, that just means there’s a part inside you that’s even stronger than I am… I’m almost jealous.

N-No, you’re wrong. I’m not strong at all, I’m just a coward.
It terrifies me to think that an unbelievable existence, like a God, could forcibly shake up everything I’ve ever known about this world, that’s all.
Even I wish for things. Deep in my heart, I have many fantasies I should be ashamed of.
Isn’t that why Shinkai-kun managed to guess what I subconsciously wished for, and grant them for me?

See, the key word here is that it was your subconscious. In reality, even after knowing he’s a God, you never once spoke a wish.
It wasn’t just because you were terrified of my warning… right?
I’ve threatened other people with the same warning, but they broke their promise and went back to clinging to “God” all over again.
They did it behind my back, thinking everything’d be fine as long as they aren’t caught.
Those kinds of people are only growing in number, so I think what I’ve been up to hasn&#39;t been pleasing Kanata-san and the more zealous worshippers…
‘Cause lately, I’m being forced to keep a distance from all this through overseas trips waaay more than ever.
I haven’t been able to stop people from making wishes as much as I used to.
So yeah, all those people I warned could tell I was too powerless to stop them, and went riiight back to making wishes.
It’s pathetic of me, but I really can’t put a stop to what’s happening anymore.

…They haven’t been pleased with you, Mikejima-san? Is that why you’re always overseas?

Yep. I mean, I’m starting to find overseas work fun too, but this was the reason why at first.
It’s only natural this is happening; I’m a traitor to them. I’m the black sheep within the group that worships the all-knowing God Kanata-san.
While Kanata-san maintains his divinity by granting more and more wishes—
I’ve been telling every single person who finds out about him not to wish for anything.
They’re probably seeing it as me trying to kill off the God that has maintained their faith for so long.


Even Kanata-san told me off, y’know? He called me a traitor. An unfaithful, vulgar rogue.[11]

That’s not true, though. Aren’t you the only person who’s been trying to protect him as a human being? You did it because he’s your friend—because you love him.

Nah… You’re reading me in good light, but I think I really am a traitor in the end.
That sweet-sounding talk I had with you, too—I bet it was aaall just me putting up a front.
Maybe my real feelings toward Kanata-san are hatred, for constantly acting almighty and God-like—
Yet being unable to cure my sister, and I could only watch her suffer…
Maybe I got sick of seeing everyone be so happy, believing in that God…
And maybe I just wanna tear apart that fake charade, and laugh at them and their shocked expressions once they find out the truth.
That’s who I really am, Chiaki-san—a cruel, unfair guy.


Even so. There’s no such thing as a clean person — everyone holds a dirty, awful part of them inside.
There is no reason for you to be told off as if you aren’t just another human being like everyone else.

…Hahaha, are you getting angry at them? For my sake?
I’ve been calling you an ordinary kid, but I’m gonna change that. You’re a strange kid.
And I love strange kids…
If you were just an ordinary kid, I was gonna warn you once more to make sure you never get involved, and never wish for anything—even if it meant using force.
But since you’re a strange kid, there miiight be something special only you can do. I dunno what it could be right now, but there might come a day when I’ll ask you for it.

…?

Hahaha! Back to our main topic! Look, the roasted onigiri is ready, have a bite! I’m sure you’ve been waiting…☆

T-Thank you, they look really tasty. How much for one?

Mm~ I’ll put it on your tab for now. Consider this an advance payment for the day when I ask a favor from you.

No, that’s kind of terrifying, actually… What are you going to make me do?

Who knooows? I’m no God, I don’t know what the future holds! Haha, if you catch my drift…♪

……
(ooh… my Worshippers have already Set up the Water tanks.)
(they are clearly Used to these things~ we all live in the Sea, after all.)
(they Finished the job while i was Hanging out with the Five Eccentrics…)
(waah~ they even prepared a Manual for taking care of the Fishies.)
(hehehe. but i feel a little Bad… how exciting.)
(no one Wished for Water tanks~)
(this was actually my Wish. there is not enough Water in this school…)
(and it Disappointed me that i could not see any Fishies.)
(i can always see them at Home, so it felt Unnatural not seeing them around.)
(i could not settle down properly, and i felt lonely—)
(“Lonely”? what did that mean again…? lonely… lonely…)
(that is different from “Sad”, yes? it is not Painful, either… what a strange Emotion.)
(it was a Word from that boy who Hangs out Here often lately… kaoru Said it a few times.)
(when i Asked him what it Means, he got upset for some reason…)
(and then left the room… was it embarrassing for him…?)
(but because of that… i still do not know what kind of Feeling “lonely” is supposed to be.)
(why did i Think of that in the first place…? why did i want Fishies around me, to get Rid of feeling Lonely…?)
(i want to Ask someone, but kaoru has not Shown himself since… he is a Meanie, just like chiaki.)
(he won’t Wish for anything from me. i just want to grant him a wish, and save him…)
(so why is he being so Mean to me?)
(i do not understand… not understanding is also kind of “lonely”, isn’t it…)

Pardon me. Are you here, Buchou-dono?
Wha—!? What on earth—The clubroom has been turned into an aquarium…?

hm…?
ah, umm… i Remember you. you are the one i watched the sea turtle Video with—

Ah, it makes sense you do not recall who I am, as we have not encountered each other since then. My name is Kanzaki Souma, I am pleased to make your acquaintance.

i see… um, so, souma…? do you have Business with me?
oh! i know! you would like me to grant you a Wish, yes…? ♪

Nay, it is an entirely separate matter. I have come to visit you in order to confirm a certain fact.
What a fool I am… I too am a member of the Marine Life Club, even if it is only on paper—

ahh… you were the one who signed the document to join, yes?
i could not make a club without at least Three members, so back then I was trying to find people to join.
kaoru had been lounging in this Room since last year…
so he told me Bluntly, “why don’t you just make this part of a club already?”
and then saying it would make it easier to Do as he likes with the club’s Budget.
i had thought that it was kaoru’s Wish… so i granted it.
but it seems i was wrong~ he told me it was simply a Joke.
so i asked him if he can Do as he likes now… and he only looked at me in annoyance. he is also a difficult one…

Hm… You speak in a peculiar manner, so I am not quite sure what you are saying—
However, even if it was only a coincidence, I feel that it is fate for me to be in the same club as you.
I have been acting rude this whole time, and I humbly apologize for not having realized it was you much earlier.

umm…?

Typically, I would show my remorse by slicing my stomach open, but please accept this apology for now.

wa-- why are you bowing on your knees…[12] the First time i have seen this in school. i do not think people do this Anymore, you know?
hehe. lift your Head young one, for it is all okay~♪

Aha, oh how lucky I must be! I am extremely delighted to have permission to speak with you!

Chapter 11
Content Warning: Mentions of graphic self-mutilation ahead.


you… ahh, your name is “Kanzaki”, yes?
is that the Kanzaki? the chieftain of this land—of this region?

Indeed. My family has been appointed that role for several centuries now—since the Sengoku period… However, we do not have as much power as we used to in the bygone days.
Even so, we continued to pass on the contract that my ancestors had agreed upon. It had slipped my mind entirely as I hadn&#39;t known much back when this had occurred, but at one time in my youth I had been blessed with an opportunity for an audience with you.

ahh~… yes, i think they come Greet me quite often. as well as people from Other households.
you do it in order to never forget the crime you committed long ago.
but, in those Ceremonies, i am always behind the Bamboo blinds…
so i could not tell it was you. it is only natural that neither of us Remember one another.

Aha, I do not deserve such kind words. However, I will surely keep them in my heart for the rest of my life.

mm~… people act so friendly with me within School, so it is actually much more unnatural to hear someone speak the Usual way i am spoken to.
you do not need to speak to me so Formally, really. it is actually Harder to speak to you, as if i feel a Distance between us.

Nay, I must keep a line between us. Even in Shintoism, it is said that us impure humans must only come in contact with God through the strands of the tamagushi—Even with the shrine maidens.
One must rip their ears to hear God, and crush their eyeballs to see.

ahh, i have heard of it. it sounds very painful…
but being kept at a distance in such a way… it truly makes me feel Lonely.

Hm? Did you say something?

no, nothing… anyway, what did you want to Speak to me about?
did you simply want to Greet me? or do you have a Wish in mind?

Nay. I cannot speak for other people, but it would be absurd of us to pray to God. It is not permissible.
That is why, at the very least — I choose to aid God’s conduct, as part of the Kanzaki clan. Typically, our role is exactly as our family name stands: To conceal God[13] during a time of perplexity—
However, from what I have heard, you seem to be accomplishing your role without any waver.
Thus, we have no reason to perform our duty. However, I wish to repay you for the kindness you have bestowed upon us—The hand of salvation that you stretched out to us.
I am the son of samurais. I have been taught to repay others by being of service to them.

……

O dear God; surely you must feel uncomfortable in this era, as faith is gradually being lost to the times.
There are those who wish to obstruct your duties and hurt you, for they have forgotten the contract from olden times.
You see, recently I have been visiting the Student Council office, and they seem puzzled by your conduct.
I say this on behalf of Hasumi-dono’s honor, but—in this era it is more common to find people who do not know the truth, thus it is only natural that he is confused.

hasumi… ahh, the Temple people. we have always had trouble compromising with those people.
after all, people from the Temple believe in Buddha, and not God.

Indeed. I have heard all the old tales of the disputes that occurred when people misunderstood or were ignorant of the contract, and thus, in order to avoid that from happening once more… Unworthy as I may be, I swear to protect you.
I shall make sure that you are safe from Hasumi-dono and the Student Council.
I will make the proper arrangements to ensure that, so please continue with your conducts without worries.
I do feel remorseful for decieving Hasumi-dono and breaching his trust, as he is the one who allowed me to come speak to you…
However, he is also someone I deeply respect. I do not wish to see him clash with you for such needless reasons.
Of course, there may also be a time when I must choose between fighting for you, or fighting for Hasumi-dono…

hm. you too are in quite a burdensome Position, i see.
poor you. shall i give you a “good boy, good boy”? kaoru said he Enjoys it when Girls do that to him.
i do not seem to be a Girl, but it may still make you a bit Happy?

Oh, no, please. I could never accept such an offer. It is unforgivable for a filthy criminal such as myself to be patted on the head by God.

oh! “good boy, good boy” is to pat on the head, i see…
i did not quite Understand at first. i am happy you Taught me that.
i will do it to kaoru next time i see him…♪
hehe, people have only been telling me their Wishes lately… they do not Teach me anything, so a lot of things have not made Sense to me.
that child… chiaki would Teach me so much.
was he Special? maybe that is why i feel so Lonely, after not being able to Speak to him for so long…?
…? what is “Lonely”? souma, do you Know?

Pardon? Um… I do know the word, but it is difficult to explain…

is that so… sigh… you people sure are Boring.

Time: Time passes, and autumn comes — Hours after the Venus Cup

……

Heeey! Akehoshi-ku—Akehoshi! Good work at the Venus Cup!
I watched you! You were sparkling everywhere! You really are our Basketball Club’s pride!
Heheh~♪ Actually, when the performance was over, I stood around waiting for you so I could reward you for your hard work, but…
You were hugging the other people you went onstage with out of joy, so—
I thought it’s better I don’t get in your way, and held back from calling out to you! How about that!? I’m a senpai who can be considerate, aren’t I!? Feel free to praise me! ☆
But man, how nice, Akehoshi! I’m so jealous! I want to be up on stage like that, too…♪

… Bucho~[14]

Hm? Um, yep, that’s me!
Right, right! You’ve been calling me that since a while back now, haven’t you? I’m still not used to it, so I was a little late to respond!
Hehe, that’s right… Our previous club captain quit school, so I automatically took the title after—


Bucho~… Save me…

…!? W-What’s wrong!? Did you just say “save me”!? Are you okaaaaay!?
A-Are you hurt somewhere!?
Ahhh!! Don’t worry!!! It’ll be fine! I’ll be by your side, no matter what! So there’s not a single thing to worry about, okay Akehoshi!?

Shhh… Sorry, don’t make so much noise.
I kinda forgot I was still wearing the outfit for the Venus Cup, see…
Then like, I had a party with the guys I performed on stage with while still in this outfit…
Oh, but we only did it after we cheered Hidaka-kun on during the play after the Venus Cup.
But then, they pointed out that I’m still wearing this outfit, so I came back over to school for a sec—
I’m just borrowing this outfit, so I gotta make sure to return it, and like… They’ll make me pay if I tear or ruin it.
But, there was clamor all over the school—
And I guess you call them the producer of the Venus Cup…? But I couldn’t find the supervisor from the Student Council either…
I wasn’t sure what to do, so I peeked into the backstage…
That was when I saw this guy crouched down in a dark corner…

This guy…?

……

Ooh!? Is that… Itsuki Shu from Valkyrie!? The one who’s also part of the Five Eccentrics — the most promising people of our generation — like Shinkai-kun…?

Mhm… and then like, I called out to him, thinking he was feeling ill…
But he didn’t respond back, and when I asked him if I should call for someone, he started screaming really loudly.
I really dunno what to do…
I think he doesn’t wanna be seen by anyone, so I tried to help him up while hiding him, and managed all the way up to this point—
But I mean, the whole school’s going about like nuts, right?
We’re stuck in crowds, so I think it’ll be hard to take him over to some place quiet without being seen… I’m really stuck with what to do now.
What do I do? What happened, anyway? He looks like the world is about to collapse…

I-I don’t know. After watching you onstage, I had to go to a part-time job, and left school for a bit.
But then I thought I should do some practice, so now I’m here again.
W-Well, no matter! Fear not, Akehoshi! I’ll bring over that laundry trolley for cleaning, and some sheets or maybe curtains!
We’ll hide Itsuki-kun like that and carry him off somewhere!
I-Is that good enough?

I dunno… You should ask him, not me. I brought him all the way over here, but I don’t even know if that was the right thing to do or not.

Ahh, that’s true…? Heeey, Itsuki-kun…?
What’s wrong? Did something happen? Can you not move? Can you hear me?

…!

(Eek!? W-what!? He just grabbed my hand all of a sudden!)


I beg of you—

Huh? Huh!? D-Do you need something? Feel free to tell me anything!

I was a fool! I didn’t heed the warning — It’s far too late now, now that I’ve lost everything…!

… Huh? … Wha?

Ahh, tell Rei! Tell Wataru, tell Kanata! And tell our most adorable little boy, too! Do not fight that man!
He’ll demolish them entirely! That man… All of them are demons!
EeeeeEEEEEEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!?


On that night, I found out that on that very same day, Valkyrie suffered a cruel loss against fine onstage.
From that moment, Itsuki Shu, who was once praised to be the sovereign of Yumenosaki, plummeted to the ground…
He stopped coming to school, and in his stead came the Student Council members, taking the center stage proudly.
Thus began the shocking age in Yumenosaki.




Translation Notes
↑ It’s very likely they’re talking about HiMERU.↑ In Japan, number four on the basketball uniform signified the captain. You can read more on the numbers here (It's in Japanese).↑ Chiaki has been referring to Subaru with kimi up until this point, when he switched to omae. Both mean “you”, but omae is more rough and informal than kimi, so it gives off a much more casual or close feel. But it can also be rude to refer to someone with omae, since it’s typically used towards someone below you, which may be the reason behind Subaru’s reaction.↑ In the original, Subaru trails off before he elaborates, so it’s unclear whether he was asking a question or stating something. He was definitely going to follow up the sentence with a verb, so it’s possible that it was “Do you know anything about my dad?” or “Did you hear about my dad?” or something similar. It’s free for interpretation.↑ As a fun fact, Chiaki uses the word chuunibyou here, and the gacha that came with this event was Chuunibyou.↑ Chiaki uses the word usohappyaku 嘘八百 to say “lies and fabrication”, which share the same kanji used in yaobikuni 八百比丘尼.↑ Originally, Kanata misunderstands and says seire…i?, as in spirit (精霊), because Shu says seireen for “siren”. I changed it to “psyche” to somewhat fit a similar pronunciation as “siren” in English.↑ Apparently, there was a muse that did come from the water, and sometimes they’re referred to as water nymphs.↑ This is an expression to say that even scary-looking people feel compassion, as well as being a reference to Kuro’s last name, as it has the kanji for “demon” (鬼).↑ A reference to what happened in the flashback chapter in Gang (Chapter 3).↑ Rogue in Japanese is gorotsuki ごろつき, which has various negative connotations, such as someone who loiters around with no fixed home or job of their own, or who takes advantage of people’s weakpoints, or threatens others with force.↑ Souma is doing a dogeza.↑ Souma’s family name 神崎 has the kanjis “God” and “cape (on the coast)”.↑ ぶちょ～, a more drawn out way to say buchou, meaning “club captain”.]]></content>

Time: One week later

……

……

Right. Allow me to recap our current situation, as well as explain our plan from here on.
A few days ago, Valkyrie — The stagnant powerhouse regarded as the number one unit in the entire academy — was defeated by our fellow unit fine.
Valkyrie represented the old era — and was led by Itsuki Shu of the Five Eccentrics, no less. Having subjugated him is a significant feat.
fine won with astoundingly better results than Valkyrie — No one could object to that fact.
This was the majority’s opinion. Or at the very least, the DreamFes system is designed to make everyone think that it is.
According to the DreamFes votes, the entire student body — the public wanted this result.
We managed to deal with the aftermath perfectly, too. We prepared everything in secret for that aforementioned day.
The Five Eccentrics are the evil that must be exterminated — And we, the Student Council, and the public supporting us, are part of justice.
That is the tale we’ll be writing. The real truth doesn’t matter.


“The Five Eccentrics are to blame for why us normal students suffer misfortune and unfulfilling lives.”
“Thus we, the student body, will join forces and eradicate the root of evil.”
“And with that, we will build a new era.” — That is the revolutionary tale of good and evil that we’ll make everyone believe, so that they have no more doubts.
I’ve laid out the entire plot. In fact, that is what I have been doing this whole time: preparing and refining everything specifically for this tale.
The result was decided before the war had even begun. The only thing left to do is to dance to the tale&#39;s tune until the end.
We have to hurry as much as we can. Eichi, as well as fine, are burning through their energy faster than I expected. It’s only natural, as they’ve been going around trampling and destroying people.
As long as they have conscience inside of them, they won’t be able to handle doing so much longer.
Eichi is more physically disadvantaged than others. Time won’t be kind to us… We have to decide our next move in a flash.
We’ll put an end to everything, while everyone is agitated and caught up in the heat of the battlefield — and before the public wakes up from their reverie.
The faster we finish the job, the better. Any second longer, and everyone will drop to an irreversible doom.
We’ll strike swiftly and precisely.


However, I doubt we’ll have an easy time from hereon. We were able to lead Valkyrie into a trap, and defeat them with a surprise attack—
But there were only three people in that unit, and they were in their own closed world. That was why it was possible to annihilate them in one blow.
As for the rest of the Eccentrics… Sakasaki Natsume is far too inexperienced at the moment, but the other three have built a deep foundation of their own within the academy.
Each of them have their own devotees. It’s highly possible that we’ll gain animosity were we to “assassinate” them the same way we did to Valkyrie.
The dead would only become the heroes instead. It’s us who must become the heroes, and they who become the wretched demons that we must defeat.
I’ve kept this factor in mind for the next set of the plans… And so, the next Eccentric to subjugate will be Shinkai Kanata.
I had considered Sakasaki Natsume at first, as he’s still far too inexperienced, and thus, much weaker to the rest…
As well as Hibiki Wataru, since he’s entirely infatuated with theater, and barely performs any idol activities—
But the order that they are subjugated is crucial. If we were to aim for Sakasaki first, the other Eccentrics would join forces to oppose, due to their favoring him.
At the moment, we would be at a disadvantage were they to do so. They still have far too many devotees.
In order to aim for Sakasaki, we have to first defeat more Eccentrics, and reduce their influence…
This way, even if they were to join forces, they wouldn’t be able to win against us. I prefer aiming for him only after that outcome has been decided.
As for Hibiki, his lack of proper idol activities is a worrisome factor.
This means we still have no idea what his true abilities are as an idol.
I don’t understand why Eichi thinks so highly of that eccentric, but…
In the case that Hibiki does have some hidden skill within him, then he may retaliate were we to recklessly attack.
If even the slightest possibility of that could happen, then our odds of winning are still low. We must tread carefully with this plan.
It’s not too late in the game to eradicate Hibiki after we learn everything there is to know about him, including his true identity.
We’ll leave him for later. This means that our next target to subjugate is Shinkai Kanata.

… And what about Sakuma? Did you just forget ‘bout him, Danna?
If you’re worried one of them could turn the odds in their favor, then he’s the exact guy who could, even if he was the last one left.
I know none of ‘em are easy opponents, but he’s definitely the first guy we need to get rid of, ‘cause he’s so freakin’ strong.
I know the DEADMANZ live feels like it happened long ago, but you can’t tell me you forgot all about it.
He turned everythin’ around at the very moment you thought you won, and you lost to him so badly that it almost made you cry— remember?

It did not. However, I simply don’t see a single chance of winning against Sakuma Rei at the moment.
I can’t shake off the doubt in my heart — That all my planning and preparation would simply go to waste, just like how it did in my miserable defeat at the DEADMANZ live—
I feel as though I would end up dancing in the palm of his hand yet again, just like how I always have since our early childhood.
I do feel as though it has turned me into sort of a sore loser, though, which does frustrate me…
But that’s exactly why I left this job for Eichi. He’s currently using all his influence and power to fully block off Sakuma Rei.
He just finished with the battle against Valkyrie, and thus requires time to recuperate from the fatigue…
… That’s why, in the meantime, we Akatsuki will support the war front.
In fact, it must be us who eradicate Shinkai Kanata.

… What d’you mean?

You don’t know? Shinkai Kanata of the Five Eccentrics, as well as the Yaobikuni group of his, are a religious force.
They are bound together by a faith that we cannot grasp, nor have any sight of.
Religious faith is founded on emotional support. Subjugating Shinkai Kanata means we are attempting to rob that from them.
The worshippers in Yaobikuni are all the frail students who could do nothing but depend on God…
Which means that they make up the public. We can’t let fine be the ones who drench themselves with the blood of the people in the public. After all, they’re meant to be the protagonists of this tale—the heroes.
They’re heroes through defeating the monsters, but were they to massacre the people, then they would only become vicious madmen.
Therefore, it must be us to do it. Akatsuki is in charge of the dirty work.

Chapter 14
Content Warning: Verbal abuse, and mentions of violence ahead.


Religious faith has no shape or form — That’s exactly why we can’t use realistic measures to compensate for it with something like money.
Eichi is the son of the Tenshouin Zaibatsu[15], and so, he’s extremely capable with such pragmatic situations—
However, we’re dealing with a formless, ghostly concept here— There aren’t many feasible ways to approach this matter. The one who’s suitable to face things like this is me, since I’m the son of a temple.
I’ve already finished the preparations. Shinkai Kanata is on thin ice, alongside the Yaobikuni—the cult holding onto a questionable faith.
Just watch. No—Follow after me without a word, and I’ll tell you all about my strategy for this religious war.

H-Hold on a moment, Hasumi-dono!

… What is it, Kanzaki. You were listening to me without uttering a word, so I assumed it meant you had nothing to say on the matter.
Is there something you wanted to bring up? Or actually, let me be blunt: is there a problem with what I&#39;m saying?

A problem…? No, I would never have any objections to your words, Hasumi-dono.
You have bestowed upon me a place of belonging, and led me to a pathway. I am greatly indebted to you; that is why I pledged an oath to obey your word.
If it is what you wish, then I shall repay you. If you order me to do so, then I have no choice but to become your blade.
I will do anything for you. I would not even object to tainting my hands with blood.
That is what it means to show loyalty—to be of service to someone. That is the discipline I have been raised with. Once you have ascertained your lord, then you mustn’t oppose them—

Oh? Well, this is a surprise. You really are quite the actor, Kanzaki.

…? (surprised look)

You almost had me fooled. How brilliant — Allow me to compliment your skills.
To think all that anachronistic talk you speak was nothing but empty words — a means to achieve your true goal.
I had simply chalked you off as proof that the world has all kinds of people — including people living like the samurai of the olden days.
But it was never like that, was it? The thought that there could be someone who’s loyal to you in this day and age… It’s absolutely absurd.
You really are just another foolish liar.
You were simply a fraud — The bushido way of life and the Japanese spirit are nothing more than a lost sense of value, only found in ancient scripts.
But I won’t blame you. You see, it’s only natural for it to be this way — After all, there isn’t any place for a samurai to be in this generation.
You did the best you could to pretend to be a samurai who holds himself proudly, and let yourself indulge in the selfish desire to feel honorable.
It’s just like measles — You simply have one of those illnesses[16] one suffers through during puberty. There’s no point blaming the ill, I’m the fool here for believing that you were a real samurai.

N-No…! I was never trying to decieve you! I have always felt this way from the bottom of my—

Shut up, you traitor!

—!?

… Did you really think I didn’t know a single thing?
Did you really think I was that stupid? You must think so lightly of me, it honestly makes me sad… Hmm, Kanzaki?
Did you think my glasses were just for show? That I can’t actually see anything through them?
You fabricated your report on the Yaobikuni, didn’t you?


……

You asked me to leave it to you, so I complied. And yet, this is how you repay me, Kanzaki.
Your report was well-written, but nobody could ever fool me or the King of Hell.[17]
He’ll pull your tongue out for being a liar.
You wrote your report cleverly, tried to make me believe that the Yaobikuni and Shinkai Kanata were harmless, and would pose no threat to us.
But you see, I enjoy reading, which means I’m extremely good at reading between the lines. I read through your intentions, and found the inconsistencies in your report by comparing it to reality — to the tale that was happening around me.
Then I compiled my speculations, and asked my parents to teach me what there is to know — and thus, learnt of the tradition that revolves around this land. I landed on only one conclusion—
Kanzaki. You denied it, but you were just another one of those worshippers infected by the religion of this land.
That’s why you attempted to protect the Living God Shinkai Kanata, so that no harm reaches him.

……

I won’t think of this as you biting at the hand that feeds you. Obviously you, a worshipper, would try to protect your God.
To you, that is simply the most natural thing to do — it’s common sense to you. You probably didn’t even consider that it would be a crime to deceive me in this way.
That’s what religion is — what faith means.
You can’t beat it with logic, no matter how hard you try — No common sense, no justification could win against the foundation that simply says “That is how God wills it.”
That’s why I’ve given up on the thought of lecturing you with sincerity, or even exposing your deceivery.
I have no expectations from you any longer… There&#39;s no way to compromise if we believe in different Gods.
Instead, I thought I would let you do as you please, so I could then use you to my advantage.
But you didn’t notice that, because you let your guard down after thinking you had me fooled.

…? (surprised look)

I’ve already come in contact with Shinkai Kanata in secret. It was one of the first steps I took.
And, like a machine made to perform only one function, he asked me for my wish—
So I answered him with this: “Tell your worshippers that the reason you’re capable of granting wishes is all due to the Student Council.”
Shinkai immediately agreed to grant it. That’s the kind of living thing he is — he will grant any wish.
He won&#39;t think twice before granting it — you ask, and he grants.
Don’t you see? Ever since then, every miracle Shinkai has been granting comes back to being because of us, the Student Council.
We’re the ones saving those lost, troubled students, not him.
And as you know, Shinkai grants even the most unbelievable wishes.
Miracles that we could never make a reality on our own, not when we were so weak — Surely there must be people who thought that way.
This is where you came in handy.


……

Kanzaki. You acted as a person of virtue, aiding Shinkai in his daily duties perfectly.
Many people caught sight of you going there and back from visiting him.
And you’re a member of Akatsuki, the Student Council force. We heavily emphasized this about us in every live show we’ve performed.
… Were you happy you were appointed an important role by us?


……

But the truth is far different. As if I’d appoint a traitor with anything. You’re nothing but a disposable pawn to me.
Thus, we displayed to the public that you were not only a member of the Student Council force, but also connected to the Living God Shinkai.
And that helped increase credibility to the “fact” that *we *are the ones to thank for all the wishes being granted.
People would start to connect the dots: you, a member of the Student Council force, is helping out the Living God—
I can only hope this would eventually make them believe that Shinkai Kanata is nothing but a convenient tool to us.
Though in reality, there obviously hasn&#39;t been any dealings between us and Shinkai.
But you see, he maintains his faith through being mysterious.[18] There’s never a logical explanation provided to how he grants wishes.
That’s why his worshippers will try to find their own explanation. As soon as a single doubt appears in their mind, more will follow after, and then it will be our victory.
Soon, they’ll think to themselves, perhaps the one saving them wasn’t Shinkai Kanata, but the Student Council all along.

Chapter 15
Content Warning: Verbal abuse, and mentions of child abuse and violence ahead.


Hey, Kanzaki. You went quiet — Are you alright? Can’t you at least respond? Or is it difficult for a samurai like yourself to speak in our modern language?

……

Tell me, what year are we in? We’re in the twenty-first century already. Surely you can think scientifically on your own if you’ve taken the mandatory education.
No one would ever believe that God and ghosts exist. At least, society wouldn’t.
If you ever seriously spoke of the supernatural, people would laugh it off as a joke.
That’s what we’ll be doing — Make everyone laugh off Shinkai Kanata of the Five Eccentrics, the scoundrel claiming to be God.
There’s no chance God could ever exist.
We’ll make them believe that the wishes are being granted not through paranormal miracles, but through us, the Student Council — and that we used normal, realistic methods.
We’ll make them lose faith in Shinkai Kanata. No — we’ll steal that faith for ourselves.
Instead of that made-up “God”, we’ll be the ones to coddle those dependent worshippers from now on.
They’ll yield to us without hesitation. After all, anyone who’s seen a wish being miraculously granted will continue yearning for more.
That’s why such effortless gratification will never disappear from our world.
Having known the delight of such comforts, the faint of heart tend to drown in dependence on them.
That’s what we’ll become to them.
Once we do, Shinkai Kanata—the obsolete God will only be a hindrance. We’ll subdue him and have him disappear. The students only need us to believe in and depend on.
We’ll become their new God instead.

N-no… To become a God in His stead — It is unforgivable!
You do not understand a thing, Hasumi-dono! A catastrophe will befall us — Shinkai-dono is not worshipped as God simply as a joke!
There is a reason why we have kept the faith going for so long — why we need God to exist!
This is territory humans mustn&#39;t interfere with!

I expected you to react that way, you primitive fool… I just said that I researched all about the traditions of this land, did I not? I know about everything.
Let me ask you this instead: You’re a highschooler by now; do you really still believe in that fairytale?
Did you ask your mommy and daddy to read it to you on nights you couldn’t sleep when you were young?

… Say what you will! But I will do whatever I must to stop you from doing that!
God is necessary in this world! It is a role of holiness, one that could never be appointed to a mere human!
It is impossible for someone to become a God in His stead, is it not!?
It is precisely because Shinkai-dono is our God that wishes were granted! For He has worshippers who serve Him! And you dare insinuate that the Student Council is capable of such feats?

Well, we’ll only make it look like we can. Although, I doubt we’ll be carrying that facade for very long… We only need to make the public daydream until we’ve accomplished our revolution.
They’re meek beings clinging onto God, they won’t be of use to us any other way.
The same goes for you. There’s nothing you could do for me, not when you’re just a hollow, lying fraud that can’t think with his own head.
I only need to throw you away now that I’ve made use of you as much as I could.

I… Hasumi-dono, for you, I wou—

What do you think you’re doing? I’ve no interest in keeping useless ornaments in my room.
I have work to discuss here. Children who believe in fairytales should leave the room at once.
From today forth, you’re banished from Akatsuki. You fabricated a false report filled with lies and fraudulence, and betrayed my hopes for you… So it’s only natural to dispose of you, isn’t it?
Kanzaki, don’t you dare show your face to me ever again. I’m through with you.

—!
…… (sobs)

……
… (exhales), he’s gone.

Haha, poor him. He was basically in tears.

… I had to. Boys only grow stronger with every tear they shed.

Oh? Are you gonna say you’re tryin’ to hone him?

Of course not. This is just my own selfish ego — You could say it’s the same as a parent who insists abuse is a means of discipline.

Haha, woah. You’re pretty dark, aintcha, daddy-o.[19]

Stick to one name already. No, nevermind, there won’t be any need to… I don’t mind if this was the last straw for you — You’re free to never show yourself here ever again.
I laughed it off a second ago, but the truth is — the tradition within this land is terrifyingly rooted deep beyond measure.
I honestly can’t predict how the worshippers would react were we to interfere with their faith regarding Shinkai Kanata.

Is that why you drove out Kanzaki? ‘Cause he’ll be safe from whatever could happen if you make him have no relation to us?

That, too. But in reality, his hands are still clean.
From here onwards… No, from the very moment we began our revolution by defeating Valkyrie, we have entered a reign in which nothing can be settled with kind behavior.
He’s someone who’s earnestly and genuinely trying to become an idol—
I could never bear to have him as an accomplice, when he hasn’t even hurt anyone, nor bears any sin in hand.
Only I need to be corrupted. So, Kiryu, you too can—

Oh, shut up. I’ve been dyed black throughout my whole body since long back, aight? There ain’t no chance for me to get rid of it. I’ve hurt too many folks at the Dragon King Competition, and other places too, y’know.
There’s no turnin’ back for me.

… I see. That will be a huge help, I won’t deny. I tried to act tough earlier, but I’m aware that I can barely do anything on my own.
I’m still on my way there… No, everything has only just begun.
I need your help in order to make these dreams come true. I’m weak… I couldn’t even push such a pure, adoring child away without hurting him.

Yeah, yeah, keep your grumblin’ for later. We’re only gonna get busier, Danna.
Let’s start doin’ what we need to do, as quickly as possible. Besides, I already know exactly where I’m headin’ — After all, I’ve left my childhood friend to die, despite my promise to protect him.
I’ve committed sins, so we’re both goin’ straight to hell. Which means it’s just idiotic to waste our time fumblin’ about.
Let’s live and die like fireworks, and get boiled up in the kettle of Hell together.
We’ll rinse our bodies with hot water then — So let’s get to drenchin’ ourselves in blood.

Time: A few days later

(Everything began to change ever since that day.)
(Actually, it’s more like something lurking under the water&#39;s surface had finally shown its true form…)
(There were already a few people who were jealous and frustrated with the Five Eccentrics, since they seemed to be given special privilege for no reason…)
(But they’re at the top of Yumenosaki Academy. Everyone was grovelling at their feet in public, without any complaints.)
(Yet… Ever since Valkyrie suffered that cruel defeat that day—)
(Everyone began to curse at them, as if they were letting loose built-up resentment.)
(Telling them to “get off their high horse”, calling them “eccentrics just posing as geniuses”, saying that they’re “cheaters who bypassed the system”…)
(They began to support the Student Council, who disdained the Five Eccentrics and waged a war against them.)
(It’s almost hard to believe… It’s as if a magic spell was cast on them… They all flipped a switch somehow — They’re letting themselves go along with what their council superiors say.)
(The school’s social media suddenly became used commonly among the students, apparently because it’s practically free and easy to use—)
(And there are a vast amount of accounts who keep linking and spreading the Student Council’s posts, following suit with their exact words.)
(They’re doing nothing but repeating after the Student Council, but the more they make their own comments about it, the more they strongly feel the same way as the Student Council.)
(They brainwash themselves, and make themselves believe that the Student Council’s opinions are their own.)
(They can relax knowing they’re part of the bigger force. Now that they&#39;re at a safe place, they make themselves feel better and more important by trampling over what is now the minority—The Five Eccentrics.)


(I know what this is — it’s bullying.)
(It’s the exact same bullying that society has constantly deemed as a social issue.)
(Everyone obviously knows that it’s wrong to bully—)
(And as we’re all boys here, I’m sure they’ve watched tokusatsu shows, and got to learn what is good and bad from heroes—)
(Yet, despite all this, the bullying never stops. Why? Because they don’t think they’re doing anything wrong.)
(They’re doing this under the impression that they’re cheering for the heroes, and together they beat down the bad guys and monsters[20] that must be loathed.)
(They think it’s fine to crush them — that, by hurling them off into the hemisphere and letting them explode into nothingness, they’re making the world one bit cleaner…)
(They don’t feel guilty about it at all! They just believe themselves to be in the right without a single doubt!)
(I hate it! It’s just vile! Everything my beloved heroes spoke of is being misunderstood and twisted! It’s being used as justification to bully others!)
(… At least, that’s how it feels. I’m not sure anymore.)
(What is justice? What is a hero? Why am I…?)
(……)


(… Haha. I bear the same crime as all of them — all I do is criticise them, yet do nothing myself.)
(To let bullying happen is the same as joining in that bullying.)
(If I really was a hero! I would’ve done what I believe to be righteous, no matter who criticised me!)
(I would choose the correct solution, and reach my hand out to those who need rescuing the most…!)
(But! I can’t do a thing! Because I’m scared! I’m scared to have all that malice turned towards me!)
(Not that I can even do anything, anyway! I can’t save anyone!)
(No one’s expecting anything from me! No one’s asking me to do it! So I’m not to blame!)


(……)
(… This morning, I made eye contact with Shinkai-kun.)
(He was bathing in the fountain again, even though it’s getting so cold now.)
(I still can’t get used to seeing such a bizarre sight, so my eyes laid on him—)
(And he saw me. He looked as if he wanted to say something to me.)
(What did you want to say, Shinkai-kun? “Save me”? Or maybe, “don’t get involved with me”? Just like Mikejima-san kept telling me?)
(Or maybe it was the usual thing? Were you trying to ask me what my wish was?)
(Even though you can’t even grant wishes! You’re not some God, you’re just a human being!)
(… Lately, I’ve been hearing a rumor — that he can no longer grant any wishes.)
(Apparently, there’s still the Yaobikuni people who tell their wishes to him, but they’re never granted. It’s all over the school social media.)
(That he’s a liar, that he’s a fraud…)
(I think security’s been increased, too, so his worshippers can’t get in school anymore.)
(The scheme that exists to grant those wishes can’t function anymore.)
(The Student Council has been guarding the school grounds, and cracking down on any suspicious people.)
(Actually, no—If the Student Council force is working towards overthrowing the Five Eccentrics…)
(Then they’re probably obstructing Shinkai-kun from granting wishes.)
(Nothing about this was done by magic.)
(That kid isn’t a God. If you ever wanted to, you could do what it takes to stop those “miracles” from happening.)
(It makes me question if they’re really going to go as far as doing that… If they are, then it’s absolutely terrible.)
(That kid — Shinkai-kun has been maintaining his divinity by granting wishes.)
(He never once failed to do so. If he’s truly a God, then he should be almighty… that he would never make a single mistake.)
(And yet, he wasn’t able to grant any wish, over and over.)
(I think whoever is managing the Student Council’s social media account has been exaggerating those failures, and making sure it spreads across the platform.)
(No one will be able to believe that he’s a God anymore… at least not in school.)

Chapter 17

(… But wouldn’t that be a good thing?)
(Mikejima-san said that he should become a human — that he wanted him to live as a human, and not a God…)
(No, no, wait. But the way it’s happening is far too rash and violent. If you get dropped down from the high heavens and plummet straight to the ground, you’d break upon impact and die.)
(Those eyes… Those eyes he had when I saw him. That was him asking me to save him, wasn’t it…?)
(He’s been living his whole life saving people as a God…)
(He’s never once been saved, so maybe he couldn’t ever imagine needing that for himself, and that was why he couldn’t get the words out…?)
(If that&#39;s the case, then… what should I do? Do I assume that’s how he feels, and go save him?)
(Would I be satisfied with that? Can I abandon everything just to save someone who isn’t even my friend — someone I just talked to a little in the past…?)
(Can I really become an ally of the person that the entire Student Council has their eyes on?)
(What could I even do for him? What could I even change? There would be no point to it!)
(So, it’s fine… It’s just fine if I don’t do anything… I—… I’m not to blame.)


Bucho~…?

…!? W-What is it, Akehoshi? What’s wrong? I’m using this practice room right now, y’know?

I know. You mentioned that in the club yesterday.

A-Ahh… I did say that, huh… I’m happy to see you join the club more often lately, Akehoshi.

I just had the free time, is all. But y’know~ The Venus Cup that happened the other day ended up going really well—
Like, originally, the live show wasn’t going to have any advertisement in any way, but people still heard about it through rumors and sent over job offers to me.
I was so happy about it that I basically accepted every single one of them, so I’m gonna start getting busy soon.
So, yeah… That’s why I wanna practice. Could I do it here with you?

Mhm… Of course, you’re always welcome.

Thanks! You saved me a bunch~ The practice rooms aren’t for free, after all.
I’m not gonna get my pay until after I’m done with all the jobs, and I’m already broke just preparing what’s necessary for them~
It’s putting me in a tough spot right now, so I’m glad you were in here. I figured there wouldn’t be any other Ryuseitai members with you, since they’re never motivated.
So I was like, oh, maybe Bucho~ could let me use a corner of his practice room for my own needs.
And I was right~ It’s so spacious here when you’re all alone, huh? I’ll make sure not to get in your way, though—
But yep, I’ll take your offer and practice in this room.

Mhm, feel free! Oh, but don’t go for the corner! Let’s practice together!
If there’s anything you don’t know, just ask me! I’ll teach you from top to bottom! ♪

Whaa~? I may need help with basketball, but I doubt there’s anything you could teach me when it comes to idol stuff, ‘kay?

What!? Don’t look down on me, Akehoshi! I study very hard, so both my practical grades and theoretical grades are excellent!

Ahaha, no matter how good your grades are, it doesn’t have much to do with idol activities, does it?

True, but… I suppose as the elder here, it shows how I have wisdom learned over time—
Hm? I just noticed this, but aren’t you a little wet? The weather should’ve been good today; did a rainshower happen at some point?

Ahh… It’s not from the rain. A weird guy got hold of me, see…

D-Did he throw water at you or something!? That’s so cruel! I’ll go make a complaint!

Oh, no no! I think he was bathing in the fountain for some reason.

—!!

I was doing my usual walk with Daikichi, yeah? Then suddenly, the guy just jumped on me, so I got splashed with water.
I guess I’m this soaked ‘cause he clinged to me.
I tried to wipe it off with a towel, but maybe it didn’t dry off enough…? Sorry, sorry. I’ll wipe the wet floor with a mop or something, okay?

Akehoshi!

Woah! What!?


That weird person… was Shinkai Kanata-kun, wasn’t it?

Y-Yeah. Yep, the guy from the Five Eccentrics.
That guy’s had it hard lately, hasn’t he…? The Five Eccentrics people have been getting harsh criticism, so he looked pretty mentally exhausted to me.
He was mumbling something while clinging to me; stuff like, “tell me your wish” and “let me grant your wish”… Honestly, it kinda freaked me out.

……

Ah, that’s right! Maybe I misheard, but he mentioned your name at one point, too.
He kept saying “Chiaki”… I don’t think there’s anyone else with that name in this school, right?

Huh? He called my name? Why would he…?

I dunno. I think Daikichi thought I was getting attacked when he hugged me…
He started barking, so I hurried to pull him and took him back home.
So I dunno why he called for you.
Is he your friend or something?


No… He’s not. We’ve barely even talked.

Hmm, I see… But you’re gonna save him, aren’t you?

Wha…?

You’re a hero, after all. You can’t overlook a person in trouble, right? That’s what you always say.
You’re a hero of justice who crushes the strong and saves the weak, right?
That guy also knows that about you, doesn’t he? That’s why he kept calling your name — he probably wants your help, yeah?
Whatcha gonna do? How are you gonna save him?
It’s probably gonna be super hard to pull off, but… I’m cheering you on! Actually, if there’s anything I can do, tell me! I’ll do the best I can to help!

Chapter 18
Content Warning: Mentions of bullying and depression ahead.


Hehe. I’m so grateful to have you, Bucho~. I had so many awful days, but I was still able to keep on being an idol.
Whenever it felt too rough or when I was feeling lonely, you’d always call out to me. You saved me a whole bunch just by doing that.
You kept saying stuff like, “I don’t want you to go,” “I want you to stay with me”…
I can stay as an idol as long as someone—even if it’s only one person—wants me to be one. I’ll be able to laugh, sing, and dance.
I dunno why you’re always so nice to me… No, actually, that’s exactly why it made me so happy.
Knowing there was someone who’d be nice to me without any specific reason… I may be exaggerating, but it honestly allowed me to avoid despairing about the world.
So thank you.
I’m so, so grateful, I looove you, Bucho~…♪

……

A-Ah, yep! Serious talk over! Sorry! I said something weird!
Being in school has been making me feel awful, and it reminded me of the past… so like, it kinda made me a little anxious and unstable, I think!

Akehoshi.

Hm? What is it…? I’m starting to feel really embarrassed, so just forget what I said!

… Alright. I’ll forget about it.

…?

What you said to me makes me so happy… I don’t actually want to forget it.
That was the most grateful and most honorable thing I&#39;ve ever been told in my entire life.
But, I’ll forget about it. So you should forget about it too, please.

U…h? Forget about what?

All those things I said—where I was only pretending to be a hero, talking like some know-it-all.

……

I was never a hero. I loved them, I longed to become them— But no matter how hard I try, I will never be able to become one—
I finally realized that. I finally recognized that.


What’re you saying, Bucho~…?

Thinking back on everything — it was all just some stupid, childish dream. I never understood a single thing.
Our world is not like a tokusatsu show. Every guy in the whole, entire world realizes that early on, but I never did until this very moment.
No… I should have realized, but I refused to accept it.
But… I can’t do it anymore.


……

I mean, look at me! I can’t do anything! You asked me what I’ll do for him, didn’t you? There’s not a single thing I would ever be able to do, Akehoshi!
I don’t even have a clue where to start! I bet it would just go to waste even if I did try!
Look at this! This is the toy figurine of the very first hero I admired!
I&#39;d carry him with me all the time, just like a charm! Knowing a hero was here, right by my side, gave me peace of mind!
But! He does absolutely nothing for me! I shouted so many times for help! Deep down, and out loud!
But the hero never, ever came to save me!

……

It hurt so much to be ignored and made fun of by the guys who were supposed to be my comrades! One time, they saw my toy figurine and tore it apart, mocking me the whole time!
It made me feel horrible! But I held it in and laughed it off!
There’s so many of them—I may be doing muscle training now, but I’ve always, always been weak! I will never win against them!
I never had the guts to fight them, either! After all, violence is never the answer! I just thought that if I held on long enough that eventually, the hero would rescue me—
Not that it’s even possible…! And yet, I still believed in it the whole time—No, I forced myself to believe in it, just to make myself feel better!
I kept believing that life is only hard right then! That one day, as long as I keep my heart in the right place, I’ll be rewarded for it!
I lived my life that way, just telling myself that, over and over! But I&#39;m over that… I’ve finally realized that’s never going to happen, just like everyone else!
There’s no point in doing anything! I feel bad for Shinkai-kun, I really do! If I could help him, I would! But there’s nothing I can ever do for him!
I’m so sorry! You had hope in me, you believed that I was a hero! But that’s exactly why I just can’t keep lying about this anymore!
You can see it yourself, can’t you!? This is who I am! I can’t protect anyone, and I can’t save anyone! I’m not a hero!
I don’t deserve your respect…!

……


………
… Oh…
Ah, okay. I got it, it’s fine… Sorry for hoping for something from you.

……

Ahh, jeez… That ruined my mood.
Sorry, I’ll just go home for today. I just remembered I didn’t feed Daikichi, so I’m sure he’s whining for me.


I did something bad, I guess… But oh well, no matter what kinda bad thing I do, a hero won’t come and punish me for it, right?
I know that already. Of course I was aware of that.
But it’s not like I wanted to be reminded about that fact.

……

Sigh… In the end, you’re no different from everyone else, huh…
You’re all talk but nothing else… Saying that you’re doing it for love, for dreams, for justice… But once the time comes, you just look the other way instead of seeing all the foul, terrifying stuff out there in the world.
If some higher-up—If everyone starts saying, “they’re the bad guy,” you’ll just believe it’s true.
Not objecting to it, not sticking up for them, not saving them… just means you’re the same as those guys, doesn’t it?
You’re the same kind of person as the people who killed my dad.

I-I’m sor— It’s not like th— No. It&#39;s as you say.
I’m so sorry, Akehoshi.

Nah, you don’t have to apologize.
But I&#39;m super annoyed, so let me just say this.
… You’re being really uncool right now.

(Subaru leaves)

Chapter 19
Content Warning: Depiction of depressive episode ahead.


Time: Few hours later

……
(… Oh… I can’t move… I feel like something precious inside me broke apart…)
(I’ve been whining to myself in my head how depressed I felt, but I think I’m feeling the real thing this time…)
(I never wanted to know how true darkness feels…)
(I can’t even move my fingers… I have no will to continue living…)
(… No, I can’t. I can’t be sucked into this dark hole.)
(Hang in there, Chiaki. Don’t lose now, Chiaki.)
(Someone! Tell me that, please!)
(Why!? I’ve been working as hard as I possibly can!)
(I never lost hope—I would always keep smiling, keep working hard, no matter the outcome! No matter how exhausted I felt!)
(I never once harbored any hatred! I never once hid secrets! I would always give whenever I was asked!)
(So why haven’t I been rewarded!? Why do I have to feel this way!?)


U-Uunhh… uuuuu… (sobbing)
……?
(What? I hear music from somewhere…? It sounds familiar, is this—)
(Ahh, it’s my favorite… Super Sentai theme song.)
(A positive, energetic song that sings about justice with a reassuring tone… It gave me courage whenever I, a timid crybaby, heard it—)
(… No, wait! That means my phone is ringing! How did I not realize…! I have to answer it!)
(Urmm…? Who’s it from? I don&#39;t have this number saved.)
H-Hello? Who is it? Please respond!
…? What’s wrong, please say something! Is the reception bad? Your voice sounds muffled—I can barely hear you!


C-Can you hear me? Hellooo…?
… Huh? “Mikejima”? As in, Mikejima-san?
Ocean? What’s happening in the ocean? I have to go there? No wait, the ocean is pretty wide, so could you be more specific…!?
… Ahh! The call was cut off! S-Should I redial?
… … … Urghh! He’s not picking up! Really, what was that about!?
(I don’t really understand, but I can&#39;t just do nothing about it, even if I am confused!)
(It’s not like I have anything else to do, so I’ll keep redialing his number on the way to the ocean!)
(If I remember clearly, Mikejima-san is overseas right now… yet he still called for me, which must mean it’s something important.)
(We’re not so close that he would tell me anything without a proper reason.)
(Obviously, I’m just worthless as a human being — so worthless that even my junior, who used to adore me, has given up on me…)
(So there’s no way he’s going to ask me to save the world or some other heroic task—)
(I&#39;m sure I&#39;ll just get laughed at later for exaggerating the situation and causing a clamor, but—)
(But still! It’s a hundred times better than being stuck at this place…!)

Location: Seaside


Huff, huff…
(I’ve arrived at the ocean! Fuhahaha!! My energy was boosted up for no reason thanks to all that running!)
(Exercise really is the best way to get rid of depressing thoughts! From here on out, I’m going to go for a run whenever I start feeling that way!)
(Anyway, uh… where am I supposed to go now? The call finally connected after redialing so many times, and from what I could pick up, I should be able to spot some smoke coming from somewhere…?)
(But smoke? What does that mean? Is there a bonfire happening or something? The call immediately cut off, so I don’t know anything beyond that!)
(I think he wanted to tell me something about Shinkai-kun—)
(Shinkai-kun, huh… He seemed to like water… I wonder if he’s once again doing his “puka puka” thing in the ocean…)
(Actually, maybe he isn’t… I haven’t been checking social media for a while, since all it had was awful news, but—)
(I was just checking a little right now, to see if there’s any information about Mikejima-san or Shinkai-kun—)
(And everyone seems to only be talking about one thing right now.)
(They’re talking about how “Akatsuki, the Student Council force, has sent a challenge to Shinkai Kanata of the Five Eccentrics.”)
(Everyone’s fired up, obliviously saying, “will our Student Council be destroying Shinkai Kanata after Valkyrie’s Itsuki Shu?”…)
(It&#39;s like they’re excited to predict what happens next in their favorite shounen manga…)
(The live show to subjugate Shinkai-kun is, surprisingly, tonight.)
(It’s called “Battle versus the Sea God”, a S2-ranked DreamFes.)
(That means only students can watch it. The tickets are sold on the same day, and there’s strict inspections to go through before buying one…)
(And apparently, they’ll punish anyone who resells them.)
(Despite all that, the tickets were sold out in a flash…)
(I guess that proves just how attentive and interested everyone in school is to see the live show for defeating the Five Eccentrics.)
(… If Shinkai-kun’s planning to participate in that “Battle versus the Sea God” performance, I doubt he’d be at the ocean…)
(I mean, apparently he accepted the challenge immediately.)
(And since he’s an idol, I doubt he’d avoid going to a performance…)
(It wouldn’t be strange at all if he is planning on participating, anyway… He and Itsuki-kun seemed so close that it felt impossible to get near them, so maybe he chose to take vengeance on his friend&#39;s behalf…)
(I’m curious how the match will turn out, but I doubt I could get a ticket anymore… I’ll just focus all my energy on helping out my comrade.)


(… It’s fine to think of you as a comrade, right, Mikejima-san?)
(You were the only one in Ryuseitai other than me who worked as an idol properly, even when the unit was only getting corrupted further!)
(I believe in you! This is a motto that’s been long forgotten and lost meaning, but— All for one, and one for all!)
(That is what makes Ryuseitai!)

Chapter 20
Content Warning: Mentions of drowning ahead.


……

(…!? Huh? Is that Shinkai-kun?)
(So he was in the ocean! But why? If he’s going to participate in the live show, then he’s running late! He should be going there by now!)
(Does he love water that much? To the point that nothing else matters anymore?)

……

(Hmm? Something’s not right here — I thought he was just doing his “puka puka” thing, but… He won’t get his head out of the water! He’ll suffocate at this rate! Humans can’t breathe underwater!)
(Did he pass out…?)
(Wait, are you drowning, Shinkai-kun…!?)
Shinkai-kun! Respond if you hear me! Are you okaaaaayyy!?

……

(N-No response! A-And he seems to be sinking further inside…? You are alive, right!?)
(O-Okay, I can’t overlook this! I’ll go save you now, Shinkai-kun!)
Haaaah—!
(… Guh! The waves are too strong, I can’t swim properly!)
(But! A human’s life is in danger! I can’t fall back now!)
(……!)
… Huff, huff! Made it in just in time!

……

(I-I managed to save him! I’m so glad I did part time as a lifeguard before!)
(I studied hard to earn the qualifications to become one, after all! No hard work or experience ever goes to waste! Fuhahahaha!!)
(Wait—I shouldn’t be relieved yet! It seems like he really did drown, he’s unconscious! I have to do the life saving procedures!)
There! C’mon! Hang in there! Don’t give up on living, Shinkai-kun!
Reality may be full of painful stuff, but still!
There’s things worth living for! Actually—I’ll even work hard so that you can believe that!
So please live, Shinkai-kun! That’s the only wish I’ll ever give you…!


wish—
… yes. hehe, you finally told me your Wish.
i’ve been waiting for so long, chiaki…♪

Ahh! You came back to life! I’m so glaaad…! Uaaah, I’m so, so glad you’re safe…! ☆ (sobs)

hehe. what’s wrong, are you crying? or are you Imitating a Sea turtle, chiaki…?
did something Sad happen? should I give you a “good boy, good boy”? would that make you stop Crying?


Uuu~? N-No, you’re mistaken! I’m not crying! That’s just water in my eyes!
Actually— A hero only sheds happy tears, so that’s the kind of tears I’ve been shedding, okay…!?

i see! i understand now! so a hero does not cry, yes…?
hehe, i am jealous. you were able to become a hero…♪

Ah, no! That was just a figure of speech, I have a habit of thinking out loud, see…!?
Ahh, what am I saying! Point is, I don&#39;t have the qualifications to call myself a hero!

is that so? those “qualifications” are a necessity, i see~ is it some kind of Job?

No, it’s not a job, it’s a way of lif—… Ahhh, seriously, what am I on about?

hehe… please calm down, it will be okay.
thanks to you… i am saved.
but… you really are Mean, chiaki… who was it that granted your Wish?
you became a hero at some point, didn’t you?
even though i have become less of a God at some point…

……

i am a god, right? i am supposed to be, but everyone tells me it’s not true. why is that?
it seems like i have become a liar and a fraud.
that is what everyone says. is that true?
please tell me, chiaki, like when we first met—
if i am not a god, then what am i…?
i don’t understand… it is Sad not to understand. no matter who i Ask, no one gives me an Answer. but, if it is you, chiaki…
you, who i granted no Wish for, and Gave nothing… you, who always Gave me things.
you would teach me, wouldn’t you? that is what i had thought, so i had been searching for you forever.

……

but. i could not meet with you, and it was very— what was it… i think i felt “lonely”.
i do not understand what Lonely means yet…
that is why i wanted to Ask you about that, as well. what is “lonely”? what do i do to make it disappear? won’t you tell me?
or could it be that, now that i am no longer a god, you will not Give me anything?
do i no longer have any Right to receive a Tribute from you?
that… is really Lonely.

—!

wah! w-why are you Hugging me? you will get wet~ you Don’t like that, right?
to you people, that is an Unpleasant feeling, right?
me too. i am not Good at these things… you do not have Body contact like this within the Ocean.
my Scales will fully peel off. that is why… um, chiaki? are you listening?

… Yeah. I’m sorry for suddenly hugging you.


no… i feel Warm now. it feels like the “lonely” is slowly Disappearing.
i am not Good with hot things, but this does not feel Bad.
it Hurts a little, and i am not used to it… and it does feel a little strange. i-it is almost frightening.
it’s so hot, i feel like i could melt…

Chapter 21
Content Warning: Heavy mentions of cannibalism and mutilation ahead.


(… This kid—)
(Has never been hugged by anyone before…?)
(Did he live in an environment that never let him think of that as lonely and misfortunate… and was enshrined as a Living God, just to continue granting wishes…?)
(Mikejima-san, I understand how you feel. This really is cruel.)
(If there is such a thing as evil in this world—)
(Then it must be this. And if there is evil, then there might be justice, too.)
(… Can I really become a hero of justice…?)

chiaki~…?
um. it is really distressing. you are putting Too much pressure — it is Painful.
the Land really is painful to Live on, isn’t it…?
such feelings don’t exist within the Ocean…

No… The ocean would be much more agonizing. Humans can’t breathe underwater.

yes, so it seems. i didn’t know that, because my household is within the Ocean, and i had not once thought of it as Agonizing.
perhaps they added Air inside the Rooms…
that must be it… i was within the Water, yet never got Wet.
oh gosh, couldn’t someone have at least told me that?
i had thought i was a Fishie, and that it was why i could breathe Underwater, too.
but, it seems difficult. i seem to be a fishie who can’t swim.

You’re not a fish, y’know… and you’re not a God, either.

… i am a god, though.
after all, if there is no god, everyone will be in distress… i have to be a god, or else.

W-What do you mean? I mean, it’s true that the worshippers who serve you as their Living God would be in trouble without you, but otherwise…?

no. without a god, the whole World will be in Distress.

…?

looong ago… a Meteorite fell down on this Land.

Meteorite…? What’re you going on about suddenly, Shinkai-kun!?

the story about God, chiaki. i had Overheard it during Ceremonies, so i don’t know the Full story, but…
looong ago, a Meteorite crashed down. in that meteorite there were many evil, sinful things—
that was how many Human beings became ill… and died.

(Hmmm? So what he means is that there was a legend like that? That people died from illnesses through evil things coming out of a meteorite?)
(It must’ve been a disease of some sort… and then, it began to spread across the land…?)

it is also said that it was a Curse from the Beings slumbering underground.
the Land broke into pieces because of the Meteorite, and so flowed out the Curses from underground.
the evil, or perhaps the curses, mixed with the Water… and spread across this Land.
a higher up of Long past found that Terrifying—
so he Sacrificed those who did not fall ill, despite being on this Land… and tried to Fix everything that was happening.

Sacrifice… That must be about human sacrifice, huh… Legends like that are all over this world.

hm~ i think it is a little different from Human sacrifice. that would be sacrificing the Victims to the Ocean, right?
they had tried that at one point, but it did not seem to Work, and it had actually made the Curse even worse…
so everyone tried a different Method.

Different… method…?

yes. first, they tore the Sacrifice to pieces.

Tore to pieces—!?

they chopped them up, and made them into a feast—and everyone Ate a piece of it, tasty as they were. both their meat, and their blood…
it really is just like the Yaobikuni, isn’t it?

A…te…!? No, that’s too cruel!

is it? but fish are Food, aren’t they?

They’re not fish… Weren’t the sacrifices human beings?

yes. but once they became Sacrifices, they were no longer Humans.
they become Fish—beings made to be Eaten.

……

they ate the Sacrifice… and apparently, with that, their illness was Cured.
it Worked perfectly. and so, the Curse disappeared.
a happy ending.

(… It’s probably just a fairytale, but…)
(If I try really hard to interpret this story rationally— Let’s say, you didn’t become infected by the disease thanks to a skilled doctor…)
(This means that they must have dismembered people immune to that disease, turned them into medicine, and gave it to their patients… I guess?)
(This would explain how they managed to cure the disease, without the use of some mysterious magic and whatnot… probably. Either way, it&#39;s inhumane.)

but. after that Happy ending, the chieftain thought to themself: this illness might Come about again.
so, the family members of the sacrifices that never became ill were protected as Gods who rid of the curse — in other words, grant miracles.

Are those… your ancestors?

maybe so.

(Which means, this absurd fairytale-like legend is true…)
(They’re a family that has been turned into Gods and guarded all the way up to the twenty-first century?)

to be more Precise, apparently, the very first human being who was sacrificed to the Ocean returned all of a Sudden—
at that point, they had been dyed in Evil, and had turned into a Monster…
the person who was turned into a God married them, and gave birth to Children.
they are my ancestors.

(That part… just sounds like a legend, yeah.)
(There’s no way a human being could survive after being submerged into the ocean — They must have made up that story to give the whole “God” thing more weight.)

the person who was dyed with Evil is my ancestor, and that is why we are capable of performing miraculous deeds.
for example, there was once a Generation of a Chieftain that did not believe in the Legend.
they tried to Persecute us—only to become ill and die.
not only Them, but their family, and many other people of that Land died—is what i heard.
and the illness was finally cured, too… how Sad…

……

Chapter 22

they learnt their Lesson, and the Chieftain after them begged for our forgiveness—
then they Promised to protect us properly Forever.
with that, everyone’s illness was cured.
i’m sure the chieftains of this Land still believe in that.
the warning and the tale is passed on from Parent to child to this very Day.
… but it is an Ancient story, so there are Many people who have forgotten all about it, it seems.
as many years passed, blood from the outside became mingled with ours… and slowly, things have been changing for us.
we must be much Weaker to our ancestors by now.
that must be why… no one believes that i am a god.
i am sorry.

… Huh? W-Why are you apologizing? I won’t call you a lying fraud, y’know? I mean, you were just raised to think of yourself as a God, right?
Which means you&#39;re not the one to blame!

? no… i am apologizing for being Inexperienced as a god, and for growing weaker…
if i was a god, i would have been able to grant any Wish, right?
but, it seems too difficult for me… that is why everyone is Disappointed in me, right?
that is why they’re all fed up with me, and calling me a Liar, right?
i am sorry for being weak… i am sorry for being a failure as a god.
… i’m Terrified, chiaki.
if a Meteorite comes crashing down again… and people become ill, i may not be able to Cure them.
the chance of me failing is very high. after all, i could not cure the rogue’s—mikejima’s Sister.
that is why he is Angry at me, right? that is why he has been Mean to me, right?
we were so Close in the past, but now, because i’m an Inexperienced god…!
he was the only one—the only one who would come to my Room where i had always been Alone… and secretly bring Magazines with him from the Outside world…
even when no one Ordered him to, he would play with me, too…
he Taught me many things i didn’t know, just like you… i loved all of it, so much…
but i am weak as a god, so he started to Hate me, didn’t he?
that is why he stopped coming to see me, right…?
and you, too! chiaki, you’re the Same, aren’t you? i wanted to see you, i was so lonely… but you all left for somewhere Far away!

No… No, you’re wrong, Shinkai-kun.

…?

Mikejima-san was trying to save you from your circumstances. But then the worshippers found out and shunned him, and forced him to keep a distance from you… I think.
You said that he brought over magazines, so maybe actions like that were seen as a problem, too.
I think you were talking about when you were kids, right…? Mikejima-san may be strong and a genius, but he’s not a God.
He must’ve made mistakes since he was still so inexperienced, and then those piled up until his position was in danger.
That’s what I think. Mikejima-san really was a hero… I don’t know how society would view it, but he was one—at least to you.
No, actually—Maybe this is just me imagining things, but I think he wanted to become a hero after seeing them on TV, just like I did.
Then, naturally, from devoting so much time learning from heroes… he tried to save you.
That’s why he was part of Ryuseitai. He was just like me… I think.
But he couldn’t accomplish it, so he failed… He was completely defeated by something far too large and vile…


(Even Mikejima-san couldn’t win against that much evil… Can I, of all people, really stand a chance against such an old, long-lasting tradition around Shinkai-kun…?)
(Well, of course… He hasn’t asked me to save him, so normally I wouldn’t need to try to fight, but…)
(I know the whole truth now.)
(And I’m sure there isn’t a single qualification required to become a God or a hero.)[21]
(It doesn’t matter what anyone says, as long as someone—No, as long as you yourself believe that—)
(You could become a hero no matter when.)
(… I really do still want to become one…)
(I mean, he said he was feeling lonely. He doesn’t seem to know what that word really means, yet…)
(His soul made him say it… I don’t want to ignore that.)
(He’s exactly the same as I was — when I was young, all alone, coughing in my hospital bed—when I knew nothing, not even why I was suffering…)
(… and I want to become that hero — the same ones from TV that gave my younger self hope!)

—is that your Wish?

Mm!? Did I say it out loud!?

no… for some reason, i could just Tell. ahem~ this must be because I am a god~♪

No, it’s because you’re human — the same as me. You can feel empathy and understand how someone feels.
A God would probably have no interest in us, even if there really is one in this world.
No matter how much we beg to be rescued, it would never bring about a miracle.
If that’s what God is… then, even if it does truly exist, everything is practically the same as it’d be without its existence.

whaa~? i am different! i would Save you if you tell me your wish! i would bring about Miracles, and grant wishes!
that is what i have been doing all my life! that is why i am a god!
if you have any Complaints, then i shall Prove it to you! chiaki, make any sort of wish right now!
i will use all my Power to grant it!
your Wish is to become a hero… yes?
i figured that’s what you were Thinking about a second ago! because i am a god!
i will grant you that wish! right this instant!

No… You don’t need to.

… whaaaat!?
huh? why!? I don’t understand! please don&#39;t Hold back, please let me grant your wish!

I refuse!

… huh? what? why? you are only Human, yet you oppose me? i’m a god, you know? you must listen to what i say!


Never!

… w-why…? uuu, why don’t you want me to grant your wish? i don’t understaaand~!

Mhm, alright! Allow me to explain! Becoming a hero is not my wish — it’s my dream!

d-dream? what is that…? is it different from wishes?

That’s right! Listen, Shinkai-kun — You can’t make dreams come true through someone else! You have to work hard and make it come true yourself, or else there’s no point to it!

umm… ummm…?

And! There’s no point in granting your parents’ or ancestors’ dreams in their stead! Well, if your dream is the same as theirs, then it’d be fine!
But! Making it come true on your own is what makes a dream so sacred!

i-is that how it is? it is difficult to understand, but i suppose there are things like that, too…?

Chapter 23

Mhm! You’re always asking me questions, so it’s about time I asked you one! Shinkai-kun, what is your dream?

u-um…? i-i don’t know how to respond to such a sudden question…?
ah! i see! your wish is for me to answer that question, yes?

If that’s what you want to think, then sure! Does that mean granting wishes is your dream?
Fuhaha! We’re just going back and forth with everything right now, huh!

ummm…? i grant wishes because i am a god. i do not know if that is what you would call a Dream or not…!
it is the same as Breathing and eating Food for me… can i call that my Dream?

That’s different! Well, it is possible to have meals as a dream if you were a kid who was starving to death!
But you’re not like that, right?
A dream! Is something you don’t have with you at this very moment! But you’ll do whatever it takes to have it within your grasp!
It’ll make you feel like you could work as hard as you possibly can without a second thought, just for the sake of the dream!
Do you not have anything like that, Shinkai-kun?

uhh, umm…? i’m sorry, i am still Thinking!

Hm. It just occured to me, but isn’t your dream to become an idol?

huh? is that so? why did you Think that, chiaki?

Well, you’re wearing the same uniform as me!
You’re in Yumenosaki&#39;s idol course, aren’t you? Isn’t that because you want to become an idol?
There&#39;s no way anyone out there would accidentally join the idol course, after all.
Why did you join the idol course? Or is this also because your peculiar household ordered you to…?

no… i was not given any Order to do so. i am a god, you know?
the likes of mere Humans could never Order me around.

So we’re just mere humans…?

ah! i am not making a Fool out of you, okay? it is just that Gods and Humans are different, we are Different existences…!
but… the Idols in the magazines and movies mikejima Showed me… i felt like they were similar to me.
i didn’t really understand what they were doing, but… it seemed as though they made everyone smile… and everyone wanted to see them more and more…
so, i thought they were Granting wishes. just like me.
i thought that they must be Gods, too! there were others like me! i was so happy! because i was always, always so lonely…!
if there are other gods, they would only Be a hindrance to my Work, but! i still wanted to meet them…!
that is why! i said that i wanted to become an Idol! that was when i was recommended to go to this school!
i took the Exam as i was asked, too! mikejima helped me with my Studies, so it was very Easy!
he had always been so Far away… but he came Closer to me again after so long, and that made me happy…
he even joined the School with Me.
but… this School was not at all what i Expected. there is not a single god around me…
it only has pitiful Human beings! and mikejima kept going someplace Far away, too!
of course, once i got to meet the Five Eccentrics, they did make that Desire come true, because they are the Same as me.
that was why we were to become Friends.

Hehe. Then your dream came true.

i wonder… i’m not sure—was that really my Dream?
but in reality, someone started calling us the Five Eccentrics… and it is Thanks to that that i made Friends.
which means someone Granted it for me, so it’s not a Dream, yes?

No, no. As long as it wasn’t completely given to you in its entirety from someone else, then you can still call it a dream.
After all, you worked hard to become their friend, right?

yes… especially shu — he was unwilling to become my Friend.
whenever i would call him my friend, he would Shout in his usual tone, “non!”…
so i did my very best. i Talked to him a lot, and learned what his Likes and Dislikes were…
i learned to be careful with what to say, and worked hard to make him Like me.
i Failed many times along the way, but… at some point, he began to call me his Friend.
it made me so happy… ehehe, it makes me Smile just remembering it.

I see! Then that really must’ve been your dream. It’s because you made it come true on your own that it made you so happy.

mm~? i don’t understand this anymore! i really can’t help but see Wishes and Dreams as the same! i cannot tell the Difference!
it is Not a dream if all of it is Bestowed on you by someone, right? then, i will make a Compromise with you!
chiaki! please tell me your Wish!
and once you’ve Worked hard for a bit, i will make it possible to Grant it!
… is that wrong, too?

No, not at all. I really appreciate it. I’m happy to hear that you want to support and help me achieve my dream.
But please, don’t use your worshippers just to help me with my dream!
If you’ll help me by yourself — if you’ll lend me a hand ordinarily, then I don’t mind!
That’s how all the people in the whole world make their dreams come true, without ever using the help of some God!
I can’t cheat my way toward it! So please, cheer me on as a friend!

friend… chiaki, you will become my Friend?

Hm? Yep, only if that’s alright with you! If you ever feel lonely, call for me! I’ll hug you!
Let’s do lots of fun things together! Let’s become friends!

… but. chiaki, you are not a god, are you?

I’m not, and neither are you. I’ll sound a little mean with how I word this, but — if you want to be my friend…
Then you have to become a human being that lives on the same surface as me, instead of a God who sits at the top of the heavens.
If it’s just you as a human being, then you’re always welcome to be my friend! Let’s become close friends that laugh, cry, and enjoy their youth together!

mm~ gods are not up in the Heavens, but Deep within the oceans, though…
well, i will think it through.

Okay! Tell me when you&#39;ve decided! I pray that we really do become friends at some point and shake each other’s hands! ☆

ah! did you just say “Pray”? i see, so that is your Wish…☆

Ooh!? But that’s only a figure of speech! Making friends isn’t my wish nor my dream! My dream is—

Chapter 24

“Your dream is to become a hero… riiight?”

—!?

huh? was that mikejima’s Voice just now? or was it my imagination?

“Hahaha! My oh my, don’t be so surprised! It’s not just your imagination, it’s your Mamaaaaaaa!! ☆”
“How absolutely joyous! You’ve been calling me a rogue for a while, but now you’re calling me by my name again!? I’m sooo happy, Kanata-san!
“You remembered my name!”
“That’s right! You had never needed to want ‘that’, y’know—for you see, your friend has been here from the very staaaart!!”

u-ummm? where? show Yourself, manservant!

“I’m not a manservant! I’m repeating myself, but—I’m your friend! Or, really, I’m your Mamaaaaa!”
“Wait—But we’ll be family if I become your Mama, so wouldn’t that mean we won’t be friends? I’m contradicting myself!”

Ahhh! Look over there, Shinkai-kun! There’s something rising up from the ocean! It looks huge… Wait—Is it a monster!?

“Nah, it’s not! It’s a drone that I dropped in the ocean to make it look like a meteorite.”
“Mama made eeevery single part of it all by himself! My recipe is a secret! It’s waterproof, and to some extent, I can control it remotely from far away!”

Drone…? Ahh, it’s true! It does look like some kind of machine…? I-Is it safe to get close to it? It won’t explode, right!?

“Don’t worry, don’t worry, it won’t. Probably. Don’t be so alarmed, please come closer… You guys are a liiittle too far away for me to see you clearly.”
“I do have a camera set up inside the drone, but—”
“In the end, people understand each other’s intentions better when they talk face to face, right?”

Mmm… I don’t really get it, but how about we try going closer, Shinkai-kun?

sigh…
wa—ahhh—?

Are you alright!? You’re staggering a little… It’s hard to walk on sand — You can grab onto my shoulder if you like!

okaaay. thank you, chiaki.

Oh no, no need for thanks! When one of us is in trouble, we all are! You need no reason nor reward to help a friend! Fuhahahaha!! ☆

acting so high and mighty for something as Simple as this… also, we are not Friends yet, okay?
…you, too. when did you ever become my Friend, rogue?

“Hahaha… I was always trying to be that for you, though…?”
“You’re so strict towards me and only me, Kanata-san… Now that you&#39;ve finally started thinking for yourself, are you going through your rebellious phase?”
“Well, no matter! Actually, it does matter, but! We don’t have much time, so I’ll cut things short!”
“First off, thank you two for answering my calls!”

Hm? It is true that you led me here through a call, but does that mean you called Shinkai-kun over too, too…?

no… for some reason, i am told to never Come into contact with mikejima, so…
it has been a While since i Heard from him, or even his voice.

“Yep! I’m so sorry for making you feel lonely, Kanata-san!”
“Ahhh, I wanna hug you sooo bad! I’ll at least blow kisses at you so a little bit of my love reaches you! Kiss, kiss~☆”

just die.

Hm. So, Mikejima-san? Your… real self… is still overseas?
I can see you through the screen attached to the drone, but where is that place…? A warehouse…?

“Yep! I’m using a network to call you guys! I’m in Rio de Janeiro right now!”
“Hahaha! ‘Ri-o-de-Ja-ne-i-ro’ sounds like a Japanese word that comes from an alternate universe!”

Why are you in a place like that…? You really are flying all over the world, huh…

“Yep. In fact, even I started to find it weird how much travelling I’ve had to do, so I did some proper research…”
“It seems like Rei-san is in the same boat as me—We’ve been made to travel far away from Japan, with aaall the strings the Tenshouin Zaibatsu have been pulling.”
“…I should’ve noticed how unnatural this was much earlier. There’s no way a religious group native only to its land could have so many connections overseas.”
“But I guess I was in the wrong, too—I think I must’ve felt like Kanata-san’s family was far too large…”
“I’ve known them from a young age, after all… so I must’ve subconsciously thought to myself that together, they’re an invincible entity.”
“I got scared and overestimated their power… So pathetic—even though I’ve grown so tall, and became so strong by now…”
“If I had just taken it seriously and challenged them without hesitation, maybe I could’ve made everything turn out differently.”
“I’m so sorry, Kanata-san… I couldn’t become your hero.”

……

……

“But whatever, I’ll keep my whining for later. I’ll look back on everything when I can’t move a single part of my body anymore… There’s no use crying over spilled milk.”
“At least for now, I’ll do whatever I can, so the same failure doesn’t happen again.”
“I won’t hesitate this time around. I’m gonna do whatever it takes to achieve my goal.”
“Kanata-san. You seem worried about it, so I’ll at least tell you this: It’s pretty obvious by now, but—what crashed down into this ocean wasn’t a meteorite.”

(Meteorite… Ahh, right, his family began from one.)
(That must be why they’ve set up a specific method to be able to sense quickly if a meteorite is about to crash down on this land.)
(It’s the origin of the religious faith regarding his family… They can’t ignore the meteorite.)
(If by any chance it happens… In other words, if the meteorite brings with it the evil it did long ago, they can easily make contact with God.)
(Not that I think it would help anything if Shinkai-kun comes over to their rescue…)
(But trying to make logical sense out of “religious reasoning” is practically impossible.)
(However, if you can make sense out of it, you could use it to your advantage. And Mikejima-san did just that—)
(He controlled the drone and made it crash into the ocean, like a meteorite… and that’s how he lured Shinkai-kun out.)
(The worshippers forbid him from contacting Shinkai-kun, so he had to find another way to talk to him.)

…hm. i see. why did you do this then?
a Meteorite is no Joke to us, you know?

“Hahaha! Within Ryuseitai is a meteor![22] So I made a hoax about a meteorite crashing down from the sky and straaaight onto the earth…♪”

… (glares)

“…That’s not the real reason, of course. I’ll stop cracking jokes, so please stop trying to break the camera, Kanata-san!”
“I’m done joking around now, really!”

Chapter 25

“Chiaki-san.”

Y-Yes? D-Did I do something!?

“Why’re you acting so surprised… You’re as timid as always—although that has its own cute charm to it.”
“I called you ‘cause I have a favor to ask of you, of course.”

Me…?

“Yep. Chiaki-san, I’ll make you into a hero.”
“There’s a ship coming over to you guys soon.”
“In it, there are Kanata-san’s worshippers, but among them is someone I took as much time as necessary to train in order to become a spy.”
“I want you to cooperate with that person, and take Kanata-san to his home, where it’s safe.”

my… house?

“Yep. You’re in the center of this whirlpool, so it&#39;ll probably be hard for you to understand why… but I’m sure Chiaki-san will.”
“Kanata-san is in a very unfavorable position in Yumenosaki right now.”
“He was chosen as the second Eccentric to be subjugated… and they’re trying to publicly execute him through the live show that’s about to start.”

…You know a lot even when you’re overseas, huh?

“Hahaha, nooobody holds their tongue in this day and age! If I ever wanna know something, there’s plenty of ways to get the info.”
“Like logging into the school’s social media through a student’s account who I blackmailed…”
“It seems like Rei-san and I—and anyone else who’s overseas—are denied access to social media.”
“Well, Rei-san just doesn’t like using electronics, but I personally can find aaall kinds of loopholes in the internet.”
“On the other hand, Kanata-san’s family hasn’t kept up with the modern times, so I can’t figure out what they’ve been up to through the internet alone…”
“But, whatever—nevermind that for now.”
“The Student Council folks are completely serious about making this war happen. They’re gonna do whatever it takes to crush Kanata-san—the one appointed as the antagonist, and the evil.”
“I dunno how it is in school right now, but by reading the school’s social media… I don’t see any place that he could belong within school.”
“Being in that place will only get you minced up, like your ancestors from long ago that were made into sacrifices.”

……

“And with that, Yumenosaki will be revolutionized, and we begin a beaaautiful, peaceful new era! Yep, yep! You need sacrifices to accomplish that, don’t you~♪”
“…It’s absolute bullshit.”

I think so, too. I see, so that’s what this was about…
I thought a tale of good and evil was happening, but I see now… it was all a scheme planned by the Student Council…
I’ve been believing in and cheering on people like that…?
I was under the belief that they would change this world for us…

“The world will probably change, yeah. But, for that change to happen, there are people being turned into sacrifices.”
“There are people who have been shedding tears on the other side of history… and the one who saves those people is the hero, right?”
“You may think differently, Chiaki-san, but that’s how I see it.”
“I honestly don’t care for justice from a ‘fair’ standpoint. Even if they’d been turned into evil within society, I will be the ally of those precious to me.”
“I don’t care if I’m called a villain for it.”

…I think you’re a wonderful hero, Mikejima-san.
That’s exactly why you’re also dressed that way, right?

“Hm? No, no! I needed this uniform for work, that’s aaall!”
“I figured no one would use it, so I stole it from the AV room, since that’s become Ryuseitai’s storage area!”

You should get permission first… I suppose you can’t choose your methods for your goals, but… you should do the proper procedures no matter what.
If you just keep doing what you like, you’ll lose all your allies.

“I’m fine with me being my only ally. Besides, no one would be upset if I took it, would they? I mean, I chose the color that barely makes an appearance in Super Sentai shows, y’know?”
“There were a bunch of other uniforms in red, blue, and other common colors, sooo… Chiaki-san, feel free to use any of them if you need to.”

Really…? Then I’d like to wear the red uniform. Though it probably doesn’t suit me with how I am right now.

? i don&#39;t quite understand, but i would like blue~♪

Ahaha, you’re not part of Ryuseitai, y’know~… Ah, but wait? Hmm? It would suit you, though…?
(Huh, wait… I think I have a great idea.)

Um? err… so, i should go Back home, yes?
it is true that the School is suffocating right now, so… i would like to go home.

“Mhm. You don’t need to become a sacrifice. Just hide somewhere safe.”
“And then, once things calm down, and you still feel like being an idol, I’d like you to come over to my place. No—I’ll come pick you up from your house, and we could go there together.”

mikejima’s… place? is that Outside the Ocean…?

“Yep. See, there’s an acquaintance I know here, and apparently they’re gonna make a whole new agency.”
“A young, new idol agency, that is controlled by neither Yumenosaki, nor the rumored CosPro…”
“We’ll have a re-do with our time as idols in that agency. We’ll even get to have our whooole youth there.”

…that…

“Does the thought make you uneasy? I figured… It’s not like you can trust anything I say at this point…”
“And anyway, truthfully, I don’t even know if they’re gonna manage establishing it or not.”
“I may be trusting that acquaintance, but there’s still a chance they could reject us from the agency. If that happens, we’ll have nowhere left to run.”

…the fact that i Was one of the five Eccentrics… will become a Problem, won’t it…
to Idols, we are the Absolute worst… we are Infamous for being Evil, aren’t we…?
no agency’s Manager would ever accept such an idol…

Chapter 26

“…I’m gonna do something about that.”

no. that itself would be a Problem.
you are not one of the five Eccentrics… you are not the least bit Tainted… you are still Clean.
i can understand that now… just by Talking to you a little.
you never changed, did you? you are a Kind person, mikejima.
the mama Role none of the other young Boys ever wanted to do—
you yourself took on that Role when we were playing House, for my sake.
and then, while everyone Feared me as their god… you Taught me about many things, when i knew nothing.
that is the type of person you are… so i cannot Burden you any more than this.
it is your Dream to become an idol, isn’t it?
it would only be Sad if you were turned into a Villain along with Me and lost your dream, all because of me… wouldn’t it?

“…Nah. I was never interested in idols—I just joined Yumenosaki to take care of you, the Living God, y’know?”
“So! It’s peeerfectly fine if I fail to become an idol! ‘Cause I never had any interest in becoming one, anyway!”

…liar.
if that is the case. then why were There idols in the Magazines you would always bring over…?

“……”

mikejima. thank you for trying to Protect me until the very end.
no matter what anyone says, i at least will never call you evil or a monster.
you are my hero…… but, enough of all of this.
i will quit being an idol.
apparently, idols and gods are different from each other, but… if no one is in Need for me, then i may as well not Exist.
i will go back home, and live as usual there for the rest of my life. i will live within the Depths of the ocean forever.
the dragon king palace’s Banquet is over. it was always such a Strange concept, anyway—me, becoming an idol.
i could not even become a proper god, and lost hold of my religious faith…
there was no chance someone like me could ever be capable of becoming Something else.

…Like a transformation[23], huh.

mm? what is it, chiaki?

I see now. You were the same as me.

what are you on about…? um, it makes you Happy to know we are the Same, yes?

Yep! Really happy!
Mikejima-san!

“W-What?”
“Wait, uh, this is a little strange… The ship should’ve arrived by now. Don’t you guys see anything above the ocean…?”
“Mmm… It seems like the Student Council’s scheme to make everyone stop having faith in Kanata-san… has had a horrible ripple effect on his worshippers—even worse than the ones within school.”
“Whatever’s happening behind closed doors is getting reeeally out of hand.”
“So there’s a chance the worshipper I trained into a spy switched sides against us, or they may no longer be capable of helping us.”
“But I already came up with a backup plan: ask Chiaki-san to escort you instead. I can trust you, Chiaki-san.”
“If the ship doesn’t come to pick you up, then I apologize for taking up your time, but I’d like you to shelter him in your own home for a while.”
“I was already considering asking you to do that in the case the ship does arrive, but everyone in there is in disarray and tries to harm Kanata-san… or even if you just sensed something bad from them.”

So that’s why you called for me… I have no means of retaliation if they start attacking us, y’know? I’ll only get beaten down—I’m weak when it comes to fighting, I’m not like my friend.

“No, there’s no need for you to fight. Just call for the police.”
“You’ll be able to talk to my dad if you just mention my family name, and they should bring over support in only a few minutes.”
“I’ve already asked him to be on standby for it. …He’s still my parent, more or less, so he’ll probably do what I asked of him.”

But then, why didn’t you just ask your parents to escort Shinkai-kun from the start, instead of me…?

“I can’t trust them thaaat much… Please just know that my parents are always my last resort.”
“Both of them are worshippers themselves, and don’t see me, the problem child, in good light.”

I see. You should get along with your family more. Don’t you have things you should be doing before calling yourself a “mama” and playing house?

“That hurts to hear, haha… But anyway, wasn’t there something you were about to say?”

Ah, yes. I have one favor to ask, Mikejima-san.

“Sure, let me hear it. Tell me anything, since I owe you big time now.”

Thank you! …You see, there’s something I’d like to try.
So I want to postpone the escorting for later—please do forgive me for that.
I’m sure it won’t be too late to give up and run away after trying everything you can do first.

“Oooh? Interesting. What is it that you wanna try?”

I don’t have enough time to explain. The “Battle versus the Sea God” performance will end if we don’t go there soon.

“Battle versus the Sea God? Isn’t that the live show for executing the ‘Eccentric’, Kanata-san…?”

Mhm. I’m thinking of going there right now. …with Shinkai-kun.

huh? me too? why? but wait, isn’t a Ship coming…? shouldn’t we Wait for it?

We’re not going to go on that ship. Ah, no—maybe if this doesn’t work out, then we should rely on that plan, but— Nah, actually, I already feel like this isn’t going to work, since it’s something I’m trying to do.
But! Shinkai-kun, you said it yourself, didn’t you? You said that if no one is in need of you, then you may as well not exist!
But there’s no need to worry! Because I’m here!

whaa…?

I want to see you as an idol! I want to see the version of you that isn’t a God!
After all, I told you that we should be friends… yet I still know nothing about you!
I want to know more! I want to see more of you, in different ways! Let’s talk about our favorite color! Our favorite food! I’m going to keep saying it — Let’s become friends…!

i-is that your w—

No, it’s not a wish! It’s a promise! I vow on the bright red sunset!

huh..? it is Night time right now, there is no Sunset..?

Don’t worry about the details! Don’t just give up and act like you&#39;ve gone cold! Be more passionate—more burned up…!
No! I’ll make you passionate! I’ll revive you myself! Not just that—Let’s live on, together! We were finally able to meet each other — I don’t want to say goodbye like this…!

…? …??

C’mon, let’s go!

wait, wha—huh? are you serious? where are we going, chiaki~?
please Explain things to me properly! listen to what a god Tells you to do!


“Hahaha! ♪ I don’t really get what’s going on, but I’m kiiinda jealous… Holding hands and dashing across the beach—this really is what youth’s all about!”
“I’m aaall the way across the ocean, but I’ll still cheer you for you two! There’s a song that has been carried from generation to generation in Ryuseitai—that’s perfect for this moment!”


“I’ll sing that song to cheer you guys on—after all, I am wearing the uniform, and I am acting as an idol! I only hope that it’ll push you both one step further, even if juuust a little…!”
“♪~♪~♪”




Translation Notes
↑ The Zaibatsu, which is business conglomerates in Japan.↑ He calls Souma a chuunibyou, because it has the kanji for “illnesss”.↑ Referring to Yama.↑ “Mysterious” here is the same word used in Ryusei Blue's catchphrase 神秘(性).↑ Originally oyabun 親分, which can mean a father, and also an (evil) boss.↑ Monsters here is kaijin 怪人, a common word in tokusatsu shows. It refers to an antagonistic humanoid with supernatural abilities. This word will be elaborated in detail in the coming chapters.↑ The chapter title for the second year era is called hero shikkaku ヒーロー失格 in Japanese, literally “Disqualified/unsuitable as a hero”, and can be translated as “failure as a hero” (see: Kanata’s dialogue earlier in the chapter). But due to Chiaki’s epiphany here, I decided the best way to translate the title is to go with “Unqualified Hero”.↑ The ryusei in Ryuseitai means “meteor” (and of course, means “shooting star”).↑ Chiaki uses the same word that tokusatsu heroes say before transforming: henshin (Translated as “Transform!” much earlier in this story, and sometimes in other Enstars stories too.)]]></content>

Chapter 27
Location: School Route


Time: Few minutes later

(Mmm~ I dunno what to do… I can’t find Bucho~ anywhere.)
(Did he go home…? But the practice room wasn’t all tidied up after being used…)
(Something doesn’t feel right — He’s not the type to leave things a mess.)
(But I’ve looked everywhere, I dunno where else to check.)
(Oh yeah, Yuuki-kun said he was in the Broadcasting Committee, didn’t he… Maybe I could get him to call for Bucho~ through the speaker.)
(Oh, wait— I think he’d need to ask the Student Council for permission first…)
(I don’t wanna trouble Yuuki-kun—He’s still a first year, so I’m sure he doesn’t have much of a say in anything.)
(Though considering how he is, I think he would try his best if I asked him.)
(But that’s the thing. It’s ‘cause he’s such a good guy that I shouldn’t be relying on him.)
(… I wanted to properly apologize to Bucho~, though…)
(He looked so down… I lost my cool and went way too far, I think…)
(I’m so indebted towards him for practically everything, and yet… I’m being so ungrateful to him.)


(I’m always like this… But… It was such a huge shock to me.)
(I feel like, somewhere deep inside, I thought of Bucho~ as my dad.)
(But he’s not, he’s someone entirely different. My dad’s dead. I know that already.)
(……)


Move, move move move~!!

—!?

Ahh, that was too harsh of me! Excuse me, please move aside! I’m in a hurry!
I’m coming throooough!! If there’s any complaints, please send them all over to Morisawa Chiaki from Ryuseitai!

(Huh? Is that Bucho~…? W-What’s he doing?)

Shinkai-kun, are you alright? Are you feeling sick from me shaking you around?

well… it is more Comfortable than Walking on my own.
i’m sorry. i am not very Good at Walking… i am not used to it, see — because i’m always being Carried around.
so. this is the Usual for me, and it is comforting.

I see! That’s good! Being bad at walking is like the Little Mermaid! Carrying you like a princess is just perfect for that role…☆[24]

……

Hm? Ahh, Akehoshi! I’m very sorry, but please let me through!
There’s a lot of things I want to talk to you about, but we’re in a hurry! We have to head over to the auditorium right away!

Uh, okay… But why? Does that mean you’re gonna perform?

Yes! Exactly!
Ahh, but we need uniforms! I just realized! Mikejima-san said there’s some in the AV room — we’ll head there first!
… Are you alright with that, Shinkai-kun?

mm~ you will Bite your tongue if you Talk while running, chiaki.

Oh! You’re right! Thank you for the warning~♪

(That guy… is the weird person who clung on to me while drenched in water. Why’s Bucho~ carrying him?)
(He said they’re gonna perform, right…?)
(Tonight’s live show is called the “Battle versus the Sea God” or something, but I didn’t see Bucho~’s name nor Ryuseitai in the performer list…?)
(I dunno what’s happening, but he had a good look on his face.)
(He was sparkling! Ahaha! I see… I, see?)
Bucho~! Sorry, I know you’re in a rush, but please answer this one question! I keep asking about it, but — are you gonna save this guy?

Yep! Exactly! You understood it well, Akehoshi! Well done!

Of course I would! I’ve spent time in the same Basketball Club as you!
But, uh, anyway… Will you be able to win…? Can you really save him?

I don’t know! Honestly, I have no confidence in how I’ll manage it!

What!? Then why? Because you’re a hero?

Yes! No—It’s because I want to become one!
Unfortunately, there are many things about myself I still lack right now, but I don’t have the time to wait for myself to grow and finally become a great person!
But that still doesn’t mean I should give up! I just need to put all my effort into it! I’ll put in every last bit of strength that I have right now, and work hard!
Please cheer for us if you can! Huff, huff… Also I’m starting to lose my breath, so I’d be glad if you could keep the talk short, okay!?

(… Oh, that’s what it was. I don’t really follow, but I understand it.)
(It was alright for me to believe in you. It was alright for me to never give up or lose hope in you… You’re the one who taught me that—)
(That’s why I don’t want you to lose, no matter what. No—If you don’t win this time, then I really won’t forgive you.)


Bucho~! You asked me to cheer you on, right? Then I will! I’ll always do whatever I’m needed for!
Because I’m an idol! Because you let me stay as one!
(inhales)
Hang in there! Don’t lose now, hero!

Location: “Battle versus the Sea God” Stage


Time: At the same time, as the “Battle versus the Sea God” performance begins

“♪~♪~♪”
(… Incorrigible! Where did this intense air come from!?)
(The audience is acting bizarre. It doesn’t feel as though they’ve gone crazy with intoxication from watching our performance—)
(—No, actually, they have been reacting erratically to every single move we make.)
(Their cheers are abnormal — as if they’re frenzied, thirsting for blood.)
(We selected our audience carefully, yet I can hear many of them causing a commotion when they should be following the stage regulations instead.)
(They keep screaming “kill them,” “viva la revolution,” and the like… This is no longer an idol performance, this may as well be a rally for war.)
(… There was a strange atmosphere to this live show before it had even begun.)
(All I needed to do was make it obvious that we defeated and subdued Shinkai Kanata of the Five Eccentrics.)
(We don’t need more than a few witnesses to confirm our deed, then have it documented officially.)
(All we have to then do is use that fact efficiently and publicize it to suit our agenda.)
(That’s why I’ve chosen to make it an S2 — a live show limited within the school premises. I did the bare minimum of advertisement for the performance, and I even chose to hold it during night-time, an inconvenient timing for students.)


(I also set the tickets to an expensive price, and announced that the regulations to obtain one would be strict.)
(Yet… they still sold out in mere seconds.)
(We had to implement the regulation system immediately after the announcement, thus, we had to spend far too much time inspecting the tickets… It left my plans a mess.)
(But that’s alright, this workload is necessary.)
(We have to be absolutely certain we don’t lose, so I worked hard to ensure none of our guests are the Yaobikuni worshippers, as they may cheer for Shinkai instead.)
(It was impossible to get rid of their religious faith entirely, and they aren’t the type that can switch to worship a different God. That’s why it was an extra step I had to be sure that we completed.)


(Hah. I must say, this is truly horrible of us. The DreamFes seems to be fair on first glance, as long as victory is declared based upon the number of votes…)
(But the Student Council is in charge of managing and planning any DreamFes — there are plenty of ways to influence the votes however we need to.)
(It doesn’t take much to make a fixed match. And by expanding the system within the school and making good use of it, we would have the power to defeat the unrivaled geniuses, the Five Eccentrics—)
(Or at the very least, we can mark that as a victory in the records.)
(People who weren’t present for the performance can only know what happened through the official announcement, which only displays the final result.)
(“The Student Council won against the Five Eccentrics,” “the Student Council is stronger than the Five Eccentrics”—)
(Without a doubt in their mind, they’ll believe that. And, swayed by what the officials say, they will start cheering for us.)
(The more supporters we have, the easier it’ll be to win DreamFes, and so the cycle begins.)
(The Student Council force will be able to continue their advances without problems, and eventually defeat all the Eccentrics as per planned. I must say, we’ve cooked up quite a good scheme here.)
(But something about this makes me uneasy — this plan is going too well… In fact, the students are glorifying us and bashing the Five Eccentrics far more than I had anticipated.)
(It’s baffling to see how far they’re going, even when we’re the ones who prompted them to act this way.)
(Within the school, vitriol overflowing with animosity towards the Five Eccentrics has been flung around, and just the mere presence of fine causes a shower of cheers.)
(I did assume this would eventually happen, but… this change is much too drastic.)


(All of you students, allow me to ask: Why have you gone this berserk?)
(Did you have that much resentment pent up for the Five Eccentrics? Have you loathed them from the bottom of your hearts all this time?)
(While it is true that bitterness and envy drives a person mad… Most of the students within this school were mere imitations of idols — they didn’t even have the motivation to perform basic idol activities.)
(And the Five Eccentrics were above everything else, and were a nuisance for it — in other words, business rivals. It’s no surprise people would feel jealous — at least, the idols who worked hard every day would have.)
(But all of you are different, aren’t you?)
(None of what the Five Eccentrics did mattered to you people; you were satisfied as long as you could take it easy in the school, weren’t you?)
(That is why we had intended to stir a little bit of emotion within the apathy of the people in public.)
(If we lowered the public’s opinion of the Five Eccentrics slightly, and improved how favourably they view the Student Council in exchange—)
(We would be able to win the DreamFes through the voting system. With each victory, we become the ones in power, and become capable of changing history however we like.)
(That was all we had planned… so why are you howling with so much rage and malice?)
(Why are you so intent on cheering for us, and cursing at them?)
(Something isn’t right here… It’s as if they’re going through mass hysteria — like swathes of people raging over the injustice done to them, just before heading into war.)
(… That reminds me — my parents were mumbling their words for once—)
(But I could hear them saying something about the legend of this land… That the evil within the meteorite had amplified the negative emotions of the people.)
(They added that it was more akin to a curse than an illness.)
(Those dyed in evil would lash out at each other in a fit of rage and begin to hurt one another until they fall to ruin.)


(Isn’t this unsettling haze swirling around us that very same thing…!?)
(It’s also known as what once happened when a chieftain had persecuted Shinkai’s family—)
(Apparently, the evil had spilled out once more, and many people of this land suffered a tragic fate.)
(Would that mean that this is my fault…? By devising a tactic to subdue Shinkai Kanata of the Five Eccentrics, I’ve made the evil come back once more…?)
(No…! Impossible! It’s nothing but a legend — a mere superstition…!)

Compose yourself, Hasumi-dono!

—!?
K-Kanzaki? What’re you doing here!?
I thought I made it very clear you’re banished from Akatsuki…!

Indeed you did. I have no right to be standing on this stage; I am akin to a ruffian running amok.
I have been exiled from Akatsuki… Therefore, I have come here to speak as myself, bearing the family name that I have inherited from my ancestors.
Nay! I speak to you as a fan of you and Kiryu-dono—of Akatsuki! What an unsightly state you present! I misjudged you!
You are both entirely distracted, and neither of you have smiled even once! You are not in the least bit synchronized with the song!
I know not what has intoxicated you, but watching your staggering, nearly inebriated movements is unbearable!

—!

I may have lost the right to call myself a member of Akatsuki, but I am still an “ai-dol”!
I am one of you, as well as your long standing foe! O travellers of the same path of dreams! I shan’t let either of you negate that about me, no matter how much love and respect I hold for you two!
And as I see it, Akatsuki does not have the right to call itself an “ai-dol yu-nit” right now! Such insolent drunkards should not disgrace the name of Akatsuki!
Ahh, I want nothing more than to cover my eyes from this disastrous scene! Perhaps I should cut you down in a fit of anger!?
Straighten your back! Smile, even if you do not want to! Do it for the sake of your guests!
Present yourself whole, and utter every lyric you sing with as much passion—as much soul as one could muster!
Is that not what you two had taught me, back when I knew nothing…!?

……

… Haha! ♪
Hey Danna, he just told you off. Ain’t ya ashamed of yourself?
You ain’t gonna start actin’ indifferent after bein’ criticized that hard by a chick that hasn&#39;t even grown feathers, are ya?
He’s pickin’ a fight, so let’s accept his challenge.
‘Course, we’ll be the losers here if we lose ourselves to anger and start throwin’ punches — and “he hit me first” ain’t gonna cut it as an excuse. But a nerdy young master[25] like yourself would know that much at least, right?

… Of course I do.
He’s right on one part: I was caught in a delusion. I couldn’t effectively wave off the klesha[26] plaguing my mind, when I’m meant to perform here on stage…
It doesn’t matter how bizarre or unimaginable this situation is, the guests are still our guests. It’s our duty to ensure our guests are satisfied.
I understand how it feels to be a parent who gets taught by their own child. It seems I still need much more training than I had thought.
Kanzaki.

Is there a problem? I spoke what was on my mind, and I refuse to apologize for anything! I am far beyond furious right now, I feel as though my beloved katana has been smeared with filth!

… And yet, you never change. You always remain straightforward and clean — like a polished katana.
Even if those “evil things” existed, it would surely never have an effect on you.
They say that it amplifies one’s negative emotions, but it could never manage to do so if those emotions never existed inside the person in the first place.

? But I can also feel negative emotions…? There are times when I cry, and times when I am angry! I am a human being, after all!
And it is for that reason that I am capable of forming thoughts, for as long as my head stays intact! I felt awful being ridiculed by you… and began to wrack my brain as hard as I could!
You are currently in the middle of a performance, so I will withhold the details, but! Your reason to dispose of me was justified, for you are always in fair judgement!
I had forgotten what it means to be loyal, and attempted to deceive the person I claimed as my lord!
Were this during a certain era, it would have only been natural to be ordered to slice my stomach open! In fact, I am more than grateful that you allowed me to live with a mere exile!

About that exile… I’ll be retracting your banishment.

… What? Pardon?

Or, rather, I haven’t even done the procedures to banish you from the unit. I was too preoccupied with other matters.
If you’re still up for it, then go change into your uniform — There’s a spare sewn by Kiryu in the dressing room.

What!? You prepared an outfit for me, too, Kiryu-dono!?

Sure did. I mean, I didn’t even expect ya to get “banished” in the first place, so I got three outfits stitched up.
Even our songs need three people to perform, so — we can’t get this place goin’ without ya.
No more of this politics and war strategy nonsense — Let’s win this fight by singin’ and dancin’ like idols should.
Once we do, this punk self of mine can finally be reborn as the person I’ve dreamed of bein’.
I’m sure you can tell that we’re a mess right now, Kanzaki… so help us out, will ya?

… R-Roger! Why, of course I will, that is exactly what I was hoping you would say! But as a man who was wrongfully disloyal to you, I could not say it myself!
It has nothing to do with what my ancestors say! I simply wish to sing as part of Akatsuki right now!
You both appear weak and pale at the moment for some reason, and so I shall be your right-hand blade, much like a final trump card!
Wait just a moment! Nay, not even that — for I, Kanzaki Souma, shall hurry back as I were Skanda himself![27] Fuhahahaha…! ☆

… Haha. He’s so happy, like a li’l kid who got his new year’s gift.
It was almost enough to fool me into thinkin’ I’m a good guy for doin’ a good deed.
But you alright with this, Danna? You really lettin’ him come back? Didn’t you want him away from all this dirty work?

I’ll be sure to avoid keeping him near that type of work, obviously. I’ll keep him far away from the swamp through any means necessary, even if it’s by reworking the documents.
But you saw him yourself, didn’t you?
He leapt all the way into our stage in the middle of our performance. Who knows what he’d do if we leave him alone — it’s too dangerous.
That’s why we have to keep a close eye on him. No—It’s our duty to do so. We have to put on a strong front now that we have someone who admires us.
We’ll become seniors that he would be proud to have. That will be our repayment to him for saving us out of this delusion.
I won’t lose my way anymore. I’m the one who started all of this, so I’ll be sure to accomplish my goal without any complaints.
And I’ll need both of you to help with that.
Especially on stage. I may still be inexperienced, but I can fight if I’m not alone. I could kill any God — so let’s show them the power of human beings.

Haha, sayin’ that’ll get you damned to hell, Mr. “son of a temple”.
But y’know, I don’t dislike that about you.
Even the part about you that rambles on and on about borin’ logical stuff, but as soon as somethin’ makes ya happy, it all just blows away from you.


It’s so naive, and honestly, childish of you… I just can’t leave ya alone, can I? ♪

Content Warning: Mentions of harassment ahead.

Location: AV Room


Let’s hurry, Shinkai-kun! There was a huge commotion near the auditorium, I think the “Battle versus the Sea God” has already begun…!
(Battle versus the Sea God, huh… It’s probably an extension of the Dragon King Competition, the one Kiryu was in many times and likely got hurt in the process…)
(Now they’re doing a special version of that for defeating their most powerful enemy, the Five Eccentrics.)
(“Sea God”… At first glance, it looks like the most suitable name for Shinkai-kun, but you can also read it as “monster”.[28] I feel like that was what Akatsuki, the Student Council force, was aiming for…)
(Shinkai-kun isn’t even a God, let alone a monster… I don’t quite like the naming, but for now, I need to—)

chiaki~? was this what you were Looking for?

Ohh! That’s it, that’s the one! It was exactly as Mikejima-san said — Ryuseitai’s uniforms were all in the AV room!
Whew, I’m glad. I was worried I’d have to buy one of those idol uniforms the school’s been selling recently.
Though, any outfit would’ve been fine, really. But I wanted to change into these if I could.

i see. i’m glad~ i am very Good at Finding things. i am a god, after all~♪

… Uh-huh… Um, yes, you were a big help. Thank you.

you would like Red, yes? i think it’s This one, here you go~♪


Yeah…… Shinkai-kun, I have a question.
Does this uniform suit me…?

huh? i think the Size would Fit you just fine…?
actually, i think the material is Strong enough to be Handled a bit roughly, too?
you should be able to Wear it, and i’m sure it would Fit you. i do not know if it would have fit you a year ago, but right now, you will surely be good enough for it.
that is why. please take it. you always wanted to Wear it, didn’t you?

… Yeah, I did. I’ve always longed to wear it.
(Ryuseitai’s uniforms… They were hidden deep, deep down in here, huh…?)
(We’ve been degrading—trashing our legacy bit by bit, doing nothing but fooling around—until we’d gone completely rotten…)
(But even then, there were treasures preserved within that precious, unbroken legacy of ours, free from the taint and tarnish.)
(And I’ll inherit it. It seems like no one else wants to, so I will.)
(No! I’ve chosen to inherit the passionate spirit of justice because I want to!)
Aaalright, time to change! Urmm, how do you wear this…?


shall i help you, chiaki?

Wha!? W-Why did you change, too!?

? huh? am i not Allowed to…?

No, um…? It’s not that—actually, it suits you way more than I thought, but--! Shinkai-kun, don’t tell me you’re going up on stage…!?

mm… if that is what you Want, then i will. i was already planning on Performing in the live show, anyway.
but my worshippers kept Wishing for me to not Perform—
they forcibly Distanced me from it, so i thought it would be too Difficult to manage it.
but if i can Perform there, then i want to. i want to take Vengeance, on behalf of shu, as well.
since he is my Friend.
… but they Wished me not to, so i shouldn’t go Perform, should i?
am i a failure as their god…? mm…?

… So that’s how it is.

huh? what do you mean?

Ah, no, just talking to myself. Hmm… I’m going to be honest: I didn’t actually want you to perform on stage.
At the moment, practically every student in the entire school irrationally hates the Five Eccentrics.
If you go up on stage, they might start to berate you, and possibly even throw rocks at you.
I can’t take you into such a dangerous place, so I was planning on fighting alone.
I was going to tell you to lock yourself in this room for shelter, and just wait until it’s over.
Once I was done, I would have escorted you back to the beach… so that I may fulfill Mikejima-san’s request.


……
… you were planning to Substitute for me…? to go Up there, and have Rocks thrown at you in my stead?
you were planning on becoming the Sacrifice, chiaki?

When you put it that way, you make me sound like I’ll honorably sacrifice myself, which sort of feels weird… But, you see — while this isn’t something I’m proud of, I’m actually used to being in horrible situations.
And that’s exactly why— I’ll become the monster subjugated in your stead.

Chapter 31

… you want to become a hero, don’t you?

Yep. That’s what I plan on becoming. The world may see me as a monster, but I will become your hero.
I’ll become a being who can take the pain in place of the persecuted victims, and fight to protect them.

is that what you Desire? is that your Dream…?
didn’t you say that Dreams are something much more Sacred…? that is how i Understood it, but was i wrong?

… I can’t think of any other way to become one.
But that doesn’t mean I can sit still and do nothing about it. You heard it on our way here, didn’t you? The cheering of a pure, innocent kid…
I’m never going to betray those cheers again.
I am terrified, though. It’s pathetic, but my legs won’t stop shaking.
But even if I’m scared — if even one single person believes in me, then I want to become a hero.

… i really can’t see the Difference between heroes and gods, but—
i understand. i am the Same as you. it makes me Happy to know we’re the Same… that is what you taught me.
that is why i will Go with you. it is my Battle, after all.
and besides, i’m wearing such a cool Uniform… i don’t want to Hide without having done anything, as if i’m dead.


i wanted to get involved… even if it meant i got hurt. that is why i came out from the bottom of the Ocean.
i didn’t really want to go back inside… back to the Bottom, where there’s no one else — where it’s quiet, and lonely…

Is that your “wish”?

ah! that’s my Line, you know!? you can’t Steal it from me~ okay, chiaki?

Ah, sorry. …… All I’ve been doing is apologizing.
I want to change that about myself, so I’m going to thank you instead. Thank you for letting me know your true feelings.
Thank you for understanding how I feel, and for wanting to come along with me.
… I messaged the other Ryuseitai members just now.
I told them I’m going to participate in the live show as Ryuseitai, and that they can help out if they’d like.
No one replied. Of *course *they wouldn’t, they all shun me… and none of them would want to get hurt for no reason.
But you know, that’s exactly why I’ve steeled my resolve to see it through.
I will do this, even if I’m all on my own. If there’s even a slight chance I could become a hero, then I’ll reach out to take it.
If I lose the chance I have now, I’ll just end up a boring, whiny coward for the rest of my life.
But that’s not what I want to become… I want to become a hero.
That’s why I’ll go there. Honestly, I don’t recommend joining me, but if that’s what you prefer to do, then — I’ll respect your feelings, just like you respected mine. It’s reassuring, and it’ll help me out a lot.
Don’t worry about the rage and hostility they might sling at you — I’ll take on as much of it as I can. Or no— at the very least, I’ll share that burden with you.
It makes me so happy to be able to do something heroic like that.
Let’s go, Shinkai-kun. From here on out, we’re our very own superhero squad!

okay. … ah, please wait. you have to change before that.

Oh, you’re right! Sorry! I’ll go transform immediately!

“transform”… you keep saying that. it is an Important thing to do, yes?

Yep! No matter how pathetic someone is, as long as they transform, they can save anything, even the world!

hm… please let me borrow that thing you call a Phone for a second.

Huh!? I don’t mind, but why?

just do it. hm, hm… thankfully, my body is Dry, so i will not be breaking it.
as for how to use it— i learned that from seeing everyone use them.

Mm…? I don’t really understand, but I’ll go change for now, okay?

okay. … alright, it is perfect~♪
i will return your Phone now.

Alright… Who did you message, and for what?

heheh. i gave mikejima a Job to do. he is an important Person within ryuseitai, yes?
i got him to allow me in ryuseitai with that Authority.
he promised to do all the Procedures necessary for me, so it should be Fine.

Join Ryuseitai? You… you’ll join…?

it is only for this one Occasion. the dreamfes Rules say you cannot fight Together unless you’re in the same Unit.
i want to fight alongside you. and i want to Prove to you that i’m not Lying.

I see… You’re completely welcome to do so, Shinkai-kun.
No, allow me to call you by this name! Ryuseitai’s new warrior, Ryusei Blue!

“ryusei blue”… is that me? did i stop being “shinkai kanata”?
that is a strange feeling… but i do not Dislike it.

Yeah! You’re wearing the uniform, after all — so let’s both be reborn as new beings!
I’ll become Ryusei Red! I may not be capable enough to call myself that yet, but—
I’m still much better suited for the role over those who cower away from fighting and pretend nothing’s happening when the time has come!
That’s what I’ll make myself believe in! And even though I’m terrified, I’ll still fight with everything I have!
I will never, ever regret that I made this decision—that I made this choice for myself!
—“Transform”!

“~…♪”

(… Mm. The air changed slightly ever since Kanzaki came rushing in here.)
(Actually— I believe what changed here is not the frenzied audience, but my own mindset.)
(Akatsuki needs… No, I need you, Kanzaki.)
(You must’ve been terrified about the legend from the olden days, after learning about it from your parents and seeing the state of your household… But I’m happy to see that you were still able to overcome that fear to come dashing back to us.)
(And I was so cruel to you, too… I bragged about protecting you for your sake, yet only emotionally hurt you in the process.)
(Yet, despite all that… you still want to serve me.)
(You are a true samurai—a man of loyalty. I’ll be sure to reward you for your service.)
(I’ll ensure our victory for your sake, and enlist you on the side of the victors. After all, with the current condition we’re in, we’ll be able to perform as per planned.)
(I doubt Shinkai will show himself, meaning we’ll be able to safely end this with a win by default.)
(In fact, I had picked out Yaobikuni worshippers that I could use for this exact purpose—)
(I told them to distance Shinkai from this performance, and in exchange, we of the Student Council would grant their wishes.)
(Everyone here has gone berserk, as if they really have had their negative emotions towards him amplified by the evil…)
(However, my true intention isn’t to needlessly hurt him.)
(Something is starting to go awry… But even then, I’m still within the tale I hoped to unfold.)
(That’s why, at the very least, I’ll smile for the audience. Even if this were nothing but a repulsive farce of a show, we’ll ensure satisfaction to our guests.)


HOLD IT RIGHT THEEEERE!!![29]

…!? W-w-w-wh—
What is the meaning of this, Morisawaaa!?

Oh! You finally learned my name!
No matter when and where we met, you would always forget it for some reason — it made me feel blue, because I was worried it meant I was simply that worthless to you!

blue? aren’t i blue?

Yes! I leave that color to you now, so I’ll no longer be blue!

Shinkai--? You, too!? Why!? Why must you interfere with my plans!?
Why did you come here!? If you hadn’t shown up, we would have won by default! I would’ve been able to end this with as little sacrifice as possible!

“why”… because i wanted to, i think?
please ask the Difficult questions to chiaki! because i Don’t know!
but i want to know, so! i will have the hero teach me!

“Hero”? Why do the lot of you try to become something that doesn’t even exist…!?
That’s a wish too great for a human body to bear! Your desire to do so will only tear everything apart!

mm~? it is not a Wish, but apparently a Dream, temple guy?

That’s right! It’s a promise, and a vow! I’m going to make the dream I’ve envisioned since childhood into a reality — right here, right now!
“Hello, everyone! Good evening! You’re probably wondering who I am, so I’ll start by introducing myself! I’m Ryuseitai’s Morisawa Chiaki!”
“No! In fact, I’m a hero that’s part of that unit—my name is Ryusei Red…! ☆”

What even— B-Buchou-dono? Are you alright!?

“buchou-dono”? i don’t know who that is. my name is “ryusei blue”, you know?

Huh? Umm…?

souma. it’s alright. i’m sure you heard the Legend when you were young… and it must have been terrifying for you.

Y-Yes… From a young age, I have had many hellish nightmares of the town being dyed with evil.
I was terrified that it would become a reality if anyone were to lay a hand on you.
Thus, I committed treachery, all in an attempt to avoid the calamity once more.

it was Unnecessary, souma.
i’ll say this once again: it really is alright. even if Evil does spill out once more, i will do something about it.
i’m a god for that reason. i was protected for that reason… and that is why everyone had Faith in my existence for a Long, long time.
i’ll accomplish my Duty when the time comes. i will be the one to protect you all.

……

“Fuhahaha! Ryuseitai are both heroes and idols!”
“They crush the strong and save the weak! They come running towards anyone in need of rescue! No matter what happens, they’ll make sure to protect you!”
“I won’t ask you to have faith in us — after all, we’re not Gods to revere!”
&quot;But I want you to have hope — to understand that heroes like us exist in this world!”
“We’re here for you! When you’re feeling hopeless and paralyzed, but still choose to hold your head high to avoid shedding tears—”
“I want you to know: a star will shoot across the sky at that moment!”
“We are shooting stars![30] Even if you wish upon us, it might not necessarily be granted!”
“We’re still too weak and inexperienced! We only have a few people with us who share the same ambition!”
“But we’ll still do our absolute best! So cheer for us! Call for us whenever you’re in trouble!”
“Don’t hold back! You’re free to call for us, ‘Ryuseitai’…!”
“To everyone here! You are all idol students from an all-male high school — which means all of you were once little boys who admired heroes!”
“So you know exactly what to do, don’t you? Call for the heroes whenever you feel you might cry!”
“Stop relying on God for help! That kind of thing doesn’t exist! And the person standing here—Shinkai-kun is just another human being who has worries of his own, who can cry and feel pain!”
“But that’s alright! Because the hero is here!”
“And so! Don’t sulk because ‘God’ hasn’t granted your wish! Don’t get angry!”
“Don’t call him a fraud or liar! That’s just cruel, y’know!? You’re way off base here!”
“Instead! If you have any complaints or frustrations — you bring them to me…!!”
“Toss all your anger and malice towards Shinkai-kun at me instead! I’ll take it head-on, and then I’ll learn what to do better from now on — I’ll work my hardest and improve myself!”
“I’ll do everything in my power! So please, I beg of you!”
“Stop hurting each other! Nothing good comes from fighting! Haven’t you all been taught this by the very people you admired as a kid!?”
“At least, *I *was! That’s why I’ll become the very same being who taught me all these important things long ago!”
“Those non-existent heroes are practically powerless in this reality, and they can’t do a single thing for you no matter how much you cry for help!”
“That’s why everyone starts to doubt heroes — that’s why they call them liars!”
“I can’t bear to watch that happen — No, it’s not only that! It’s because I want to repay their kindness, for teaching me everything important to know—”
“That’s why I’ll be protecting their dignity! If there are no heroes in this world, then I’ll become the hero!”
“I’ll keep saying it — the hero is right here!”

Chapter 33

… Haha. I dunno what happened to you, but you’ve bounced back stronger, haven’t ya, Morisawa?
You don’t need to yell it so loud — I’ve always known you were a real cool hero.
(But that’s going to be a thorny path for you, Morisawa. The students aren’t actin’ normally right now — they’re completely blinded by malice.)
(They’ll gang up on you if you throw yourself out to them like that.)
(Look around you— everyone in the audience came here to crush the wretched Five Eccentrics.)
(No matter how much sincerity your speech holds, you won’t be able to stop them — not when they’re in such a frenzy.)
(All those raised fists will turn towards you instead.)
(… Hm, then I guess I’ve got no other choice. If that’s what they’re gonna do, then I just gotta protect ya.)
(I’ll make sure of it this time— I’ll protect my treasured friend in a respectable way—without a single shred of violence.)
Hasumi.

… Hm. I was a little shaken after seeing such an unexpected sight, but — our plans haven’t changed. We’ll do what we must, carefully.
“Morisawa. Sorry to interrupt your excitement, but it’s not your turn.”
“According to DreamFes regulations, performances begin from the unit with the least amount of track records.”
(I’ll have to change the regulations to avoid such an unexpected scenario from happening ever again…)
(I’ll change it so that the units with the highest track record in DreamFes will perform first.)
(We don’t mesh well with the concept of an opening act[31], but… I’ll be able to move the game pieces forward on the board however I see fit.)
“Ryuseitai has hardly done any activities, and thus, is much lower than us Akatsuki. In other words, your turn has already ended.”
“You’ve lost this DreamFes. You didn’t perform in the allocated time for your unit, so you have zero votes.”


(But… Even so—)
“… I’ll permit Shinkai’s enlistment into Ryuseitai for this performance.”
“He was working on his own, so I had announced his unit as ‘unknown’ for the time being.”
“That meant he could perform on stage with whichever unit he preferred — Ryuseitai included.”
(Originally, had Shinkai participated— he would have attempted to perform alone, unable to join a unit…)
(And thus, lose in the Battle versus the Sea God, as I made it a rule that one must be in a unit to participate.)
(We would have been able to win against him, even if he were to break free from his worshipper’s wishes.)
(Mmm, no— That’s still what has happened here.)
(After all, we won in the end. We defeated Shinkai Kanata of the Five Eccentrics, and advanced our revolution one step forward. Now, all we must do is announce that fact, and we will commence with cleaning up the aftermath.)
“Nevertheless, your turn is still over… and you’ve still lost.”
“So stand back at once. You said what you wanted to say, didn’t you, Morisawa?”


(… There’s no need for you to bear the brunt of their malice any longer.)
(Yumenosaki is acting bizarre right now — at this point, the mobs of students might be driven to annihilate you out of sheer fury.)
(In this washed-up world, overflowing with malice, you did everything you could for the sake of other people, with no ulterior motive.)
(A good-natured person like you should never get hurt for no reason.)
(Ahh… How can we even call ourselves the “Student Council” when we can’t even protect the earnest, good-natured students we have…)
“Kiryu, Kanzaki, we’re still in the middle of our song. We’ll be singing until the very end. Ryuseitai, get back — we’ll end this performance and conclude our battle.”

“Gotcha. Get back, Morisawa. We already got what you wanted to say.”
“I’m cheerin’ for ya. Go ahead and tell me if there’s anythin’ I can do for you, ‘cuz this Kiryu Kuro of Akatsuki will make sure he’ll be useful for ya.”
“We’re friends, after all. Whatever concerns you concerns me, too — if anyone ever messes with you, just tell me—”
“I’ll clean ‘em up with my own two hands~♪”

“Hehe, it appears that attempting to torment the man known as Morisawa is an act equivalent to picking a fight with Kiryu-dono…”
“My oh my. Personally, I would never be able to conduct such a terrifying act~♪”
(Hehe, how magnificent. As I thought, my seniors in Akatsuki are not tyrants fond of brutality… Even in a bizarre state, they continue to do their best to achieve what is right without relenting.)
(It is exactly for that reason that I shall serve them. Not because my parents have ordered me to, but because I want to.)
(With sincere loyalty! I shall become Akatsuki’s blade!)
(Now then, how has the audience been responding…?)
(…? How strange. They were excessively berserk only a moment ago — and yet, they are now quiet, as though cold water was thrown on them—)
(As if they have become possessed by a spirit.)


“♪~♪~♪”

(…! Buchou-dono is singing along to the song unplanned!)
(His voice is so divine and otherworldly, I could not even tell it was a person’s voice at first!)
(As soon as the audience heard him, they fell in a trance, despite having been dyed in malice—)
(Their expressions became akin to a youth of their age — as if a curse has been purified through a kagura[32] performance.)
(Could it be… that? I contemplated the truth of the legend for a long time, only to conclude it was nothing but a fairytale…)
(But this spectacle… this unbelievable, miraculous phenomenon—)
(Ahh, this is why we have been protecting you for generations… for you are the ones capable of pacifying the evil—)
(G-God—)

“…? huh? am i not Allowed to sing?”
“i’m sorry. it’s my First time standing on a real Stage, so i don’t know what i’m supposed to do.”

“… Nah. Must’ve been borin’ to just stand around, so sing along with us as a backup singer. You’re up on stage now, after all — not to mention, you’re an idol too.”
“You can do the same, Morisawa. You guys may have lost, but that doesn’t mean you died or anythin’.”

“That’s right. While you do become a spirit once you die[33]… your soul won’t be able to move on in peace if you leave behind regrets. Do everything you can while you’re still alive.”

“Ahh… Don’t worry, we haven’t died. We may have lost, but you haven’t killed us without mercy, either.”
“In fact, we’re going to start living from now on.”
“We’ll live on. I was fortunate enough to make an irreplaceable comrade who’ll walk by my side—and who’ll chase after the same dreams with me.”
“Don’t say it’s only for this ‘one occasion’ — Let’s always sing together from here on out… Shinkai-kun~♪”
“No— Ryusei Blue! Let’s burn the flames of justice infinitely, and resound our ensemble!”
“♪~♪~♪”

“~…♪”

Chapter Index
Ch 1 - Ch 2 - Ch 3 - Ch 4


Chapter 1
Content Warning: Light-hearted PTSD mentions.

Location: Motor Show Venue


Time: Time passes; the day of Motor Show has arrived.

Fufu. Rather than the live performances we as idols should be used to doing, promoting things such as cars has become the work that Alkaloid has been far more familiar with at the moment.
As you may recall, before our first performance at the Bon Festival, we had quite the number of part-time jobs under our belt—
Those experiences are not in vain. Each and every one is still within our minds, and have brought us to this day.
Thank you, O&#39;Heavenly Father, for blessing us with this opportunity.

…………

…………

My, whatever is the matter? You two seem quite dispirited; could it be that the fatigue from the MDM has yet to wear off?
Perhaps it&#39;d be good for the two of you to follow the example of Hiiro-san and those in Ryuseitai and better your stamina.
Well, even Mayoi-san, who normally becomes ill when faced with the prospect of the crowds we would face with our part-time work, was able to do as he should before one.
That much is admirable. Though Motor Show is a simple project, it&#39;s a good way to determine just how much we have truly grown since then.

That&#39;s right. Ryuseitai will be handling the more difficult portion, while we of Alkaloid shall be doing what we can to aid them.
In fact, it is such a simple task that I may have too much energy for it!

Fufu. Well, seeing as it is a joint effort of our unit and theirs, it wouldn&#39;t do to act out of order and cause trouble for them.
Rather, you should save all of that abundant energy for the final performance, don&#39;t you think?

I shall! Though we have only been practicing for a short time, we have prepared so thoroughly that I&#39;m certain we&#39;ll be able to assist Buchou— No, all of Ryuseitai!
We&#39;ll ensure that they never regret inviting us to walk this path with them!
You too, Aira, Mayoi-senpai — let&#39;s do our best and give it our all!
However, if it does become too much for either of you, then please, do tell me at once! I&#39;ll take your work as my own!
That is what a chief does. As the very head of his people, he aspires to lead others by example; Buchou Nagumo Tetora of Ryuseitai taught me as much.

That&#39;s correct. Though Ryuseitai&#39;s present condition is unclear to us, as they are focusing their efforts in an area apart from ours…
During practice, as well as the preparations done today, there truly wasn’t anyone who worked as hard as Ryuseitai-N&#39;s leader — Tetora-san.
I&#39;d like to do the same. Heaven is not reached through leisure, but solely through steady, hard work.

Precisely. We saved ourselves from being fired by working hard through what we steadily accumulated.
It isn&#39;t as if I hope the same thing would happen again in the future, but it is thanks to that experience that we are very familiar with that method of doing things.
It&#39;s one of the most standard tactics to fight with your strongest assets on the battlefield!

…How are you two— No, how are you, Hiro-kun, so energetic right now?
I just can&#39;t… Seeing all of these cars everywhere just reminds me of what I can only call Tattsun-senpai&#39;s Highway to Heaven driving, or something — and my stomach starts to churn all over again…
I think I&#39;ve got PTSD from it…

Fufu. Even so, that&#39;s rather fitting considering our soldier motif, isn&#39;t it…?
Well, I don&#39;t really recall the time we spent driving around myself, but I think that&#39;s due to me fainting from fright during the ride…
But even regardless of that, I&#39;m still not particularly great with crowds of people, as usual.

Oh? I do apologize for that, but I only had the best of intentions in mind while doing this.

If you truly feel that way, then I think it would be fine if you two were to take a break.
In the meanwhile, I&#39;ll tell you what I learned of Motor Show myself — for reference, these are from records of the event they hold annually.
However… It would seem that the number of guests who attend decreases every year. Even now the place is rather deserted, with not a single person in sight, apart from ourselves.
That is why they&#39;ve entrusted us with the job of gathering attendees and enlivening the venue— Though, compared to Ryuseitai, we are comparatively unknown in ES.
The number of people who would come to see us alone is not very many.
On top of that, it appears that those who like idols and those who want to buy a car don&#39;t overlap very much at all.
In other words, this event may do well in bringing in new clients and idol fans through Motor Show, but it won&#39;t stop the declining rate of customers completely.
Apparently, there are not very many people who&#39;d like to buy a car in recent years.

Mm. Well, there&#39;s a reason for that in the first place. Japan itself is a small country, so there is not much need for roads — save for rural areas, which allow wider roads.
Otherwise, a simple bicycle, or the railway system, born from human stubbornness— or rather, born from hopes and dreams, would suffice.

That&#39;s right. For this country, the car was but a solitary bloom that blossomed for a mere instance in the economic wake of the explosion caused by Japan&#39;s post-war era in the 1950s onward…
It feels as if idols have captured that spot instead, which makes it feel rather karmatic that we, as idols, are now advertising them.

Yes, though it isn&#39;t as if we are atoning for anything…
Let us mourn and give appropriate thanks to the car, which propelled our country into a position of wealth — let&#39;s make this Motor Show one to remember.

Heehee, it feels like everyone&#39;s done more than enough research on cars for this job, so we all really know our stuff—
TBH, it was pretty fun to look up the history of cars and see what kinds were trendy in the past.
And I really like being able to name all the cars that&#39;re lined up around us, though I don&#39;t know why…
But I think it&#39;d be nice if people took an interest in us, in Alkaloid, and remembered us the same way.
So I guess I’ll work hard and make that a reality. People won&#39;t remember idols who&#39;ve got gloomy looks on their face, after all! So we’ll do everything we can to make this place a party for the guests who&#39;ve gathered here today!
We&#39;ll give it our all to make sure that they have a ton of fun and feel like it was worth coming out here!

Let&#39;s. We’ll perform in a way that very much suits the spirit of Alkaloid. Even if we&#39;re nothing but a pack of cards played to idle away the time, let&#39;s ensure they at least find value in that time they spent doing so.

Chapter 2

…………

Hm? Could that be…?
Well met, Chiaki-senpai! What a coincidence it is to meet you here!

Ohhh? Yup, it’s me, the Burning Heart Morisawa Chiaki!
It’s been so long, Hero-kun! I’m more than glad to see you working hard as an idol! Ha ha ha!! ☆

I am doing my best. However, as I have clarified many times before, my name is not Hero, but Hiiro.

Yes, and what a wonderful name that is!
I’m sure your parents gave you all their blessings with that name! Aren’t you lucky! You’ve been a hero since the day you were born!

Ahh, Hiro-kun&#39;s even acquainted with Morisawa-senpai… I&#39;m so jelly.
A-Are you performing in Motor Show too, Senpai?

Nope! If I were to intrude, I’d only be a hindrance to Ryuseitai-N… I don’t plan to perform; I’m actually only here by coincidence.

No way, this can&#39;t be just a coincidence. This place is pretty far away from ES, after all.

Oh, but it is! You see, I’ve been thinking of getting a driver’s license!
Not only that, but I just so happened to have a job nearby, so I figured I could take a peek at how Motor Show’s going! Just to pass some time, you see! Making the most of my breaktime and all!
And of course, I’ll be cheering for Ryuseitai-N! But gosh, what a strange coincidence this all is, huh!?
I’ll have to back them up in case they get into any trouble! After all, a hero offers their hand to anyone who needs it, and a hero is just what I am!

chiaki~ so you really did show up.

Woah!? K-Kanata! Huh!? Weren’t all of Ryuseitai supposed to be on the opposite side of the venue!?

yes, that’s right. it’s going swimmingly well~ the place is packed with people, and a lot of the “n” members came rushing over to join.
they said that they had a change of heart, and decided not to quit after all…
instead, they’re working hard to do whatever they can, as best as they can.

I-I see… I’m glad to hear that. Actually, no—I knew deep down this would happen.
Nagumo is already a hundred times more splendid a hero than when I first became a leader.
He’s still inexperienced, so his earnest side wound up also being his weakness…
But now that he’s grown, he’ll become the hope, inspiration, and role model for any kid who’s suffering similarly within this warped society.
Actually, let me amend that— he’ll become the one to rescue them. A hero&#39;s duty is to save others, but most of all— Becoming this symbol is what makes the present day Ryusei Red undoubtedly a hero.
I can tell that I made the right choice when I chose him to take after “red” in my place.

if that’s how you feel, then please tell him that. tetora may have grown, but he’s still a child.
he’s surely had moments where he’s shed tears from anxiety.
i can’t handle salty water— the only one who can wipe his tears away is you, chiaki, because you’re the one who passed your position onto him in the first place.
now then, with that said… let’s go join everyone else.

Huh? Erm, but—I’m just a regular ol’ visitor, y’know!?
And I just happened to end up here! I shouldn’t get in the way of their work when they’re focused, right!?

mhm, mhm, i know the truth. no need to come up with excuses. let’s go on stage with everyone, why don’t we?
i am sure you practiced for motor show’s performance anyway, didn’t you? just in the slight chance you’d have to perform. you’ve always been that sort of person—
and it is a hero’s duty to be prepared for that “slight chance”.
besides, you’d never distance yourself from others simply because you’re too busy.
we are talking about mr. lonely here, aren’t we?

Uuu… (sobs) I’m sorry! I lied to myself!
I was actually so, so, sooooo worried!! I wanted to do whatever I could for them!
But… If I step in and do everything for them, they’ll never, ever grooow…!!

mhm, mhm, i said i know already, didn’t i? and maybe… they do too.

…Wh-What just happened? They disappeared pretty much the moment they appeared.

Fufu. That is rather &quot;hero-like&quot; of them, isn&#39;t it…? But because of who I am, I&#39;m not very good with tokusatsu shows, nor heroes themselves…
Despite that, I&#39;m at home with those of Ryuseitai— They lended a hand to someone as disgusting and repulsive as myself… It warms my heart.

Yes. It would seem as if their energy has given us some of our own as well; I truly am honored to be performing beside Ryuseitai.
Fufu. Owning a splendid car may not inherently make you a splendid driver, but if you are able to drive it properly and become used to what you own—
Then you will no longer be just a sly fox borrowing a tiger&#39;s dignified presence, but rather an amazing person that one can be proud of; that is what I hope I can become as well.

Chapter 3
Content Warning: Obsessive behavior over a person, and mentions of sexual harrassment.

Location: Motor Show Stage


Time: Few hours later

Heeey, Alkaloid! Do you mind coming over here? We’re about to commence the finale for Motor Show!

Of couuurse, Chief! If it were for you, I&#39;d step through blazing fires and raging waters alike~!
Though I am not very good with crowds, I shall do my all for yooou~! ♪

Wah—! Cease this at once, you mustn’t hug me, Mayoi-dono! I’m not against it, but I won’t be able to move like this! Stay down!

Ahhh, mmm… Ryuseitai was working ever-so-hard themselves in promoting cars, weren&#39;t they? I can smell the sweet sweat of your efforts even now—

P-Please don’t sniff me… If you ever did this to anyone but I, you’d be sued for sexual harassment, understood?

Uh no, that’s a no-go no matter what, including when he does it to you.
I feel like it shouldn’t be acceptable behavior even if the person’s chill with it. Is this guy really safe…? I’m pretty worried, man~

Fufu. I apologize, Buchou, it&#39;s simply that Mayoi-senpai acts erratically from time to time.

Erm, I don’t think a lighthearted “sorry” will cut it. I’d like you guys to amend it if you’re aware of it.
You guys were the tip of the troublemaking over at ES during the summer, so it sure feels just like you to be this way…

Very much so. There is still much we are lacking in as proper idols, so we cannot call ourselves such yet.
That is why I&#39;d like to borrow knowledge from my superiors in Ryuseitai—
I&#39;d like you to answer this for me, please. … What are &quot;idols&quot; to you all?

Aight then! I’m crappy at talking, so I’ll show ya instead!
We’re— No, I’m still inexperienced enough to trip over myself all the time, but I want you to trust and follow after me! I’ll make sure you won’t regret it!
I’m gonna guide ya so well, no car crash’ll be happening anywhere near us~♪

Mhm, how wonderful! I’m so proud of you, Nagumo! You&#39;ve truly become the kind of man who’s a perfect fit for the color red! I&#39;m so emotional I can hardly see you through my tears!

Holy—! Man, it sure doesn’t suit you to wear a color that isn’t red, Morisawa-senpai…
But I guess it’d be too weird to have two reds on stage, so we’ve just gotta make do with this.

Yep. Red may be the color of the leader, but that doesn’t mean the other colors are any less important to it.
The most important thing is to harmonize several colors together— though I know I don’t need to tell you that.
Besides, there are times when red is a heavy burden on me, too.
That’s just one of the reasons why I’m happy to get a chance to don a different color, even if it’s only for a brief moment— and I get to do so right now because this performance is led by Ryuseitai-N.
Thank you, Nagumo, for growing up to be such a reliable man that I can entrust red to.

Why’re you thanking me? I should be the one showing my gratitude, Morisawa-senpai.
I’m so grateful you brought us all the way here. Thanks to you, we got to have a safe, pleasant trip… You couldn’t have made it any better for us.
Heheh. But driving for a looong time is one of the many causes of accidents, so unworthy as I may be— Nagumo Tetora’s gonna take the wheel from here on!
So I’d like you seniors to just sit back, relax, and enjoy the scenery from the backseat!
Everyone’s seat belts are buckled by now, right? Aight, let’s make sure we follow the traffic rules here— ‘Cuz I’m gonna rev up the engine and put the pedal to the metal!
“Heya guys~! I’m Nagumo Tetora, a member of Ryuseitai!”
“Thanks a ton for showing up to Motor Show! We’re gonna make sure you love what we’re planning to do here, so look forward to seein’ it!”
“We’re gonna keep pressing forward! For the sake of justice, we’ll keep on going and going— carrying all your hopes and dreams with us!”
“♪~♪~♪”

Ooh… Tetora-kun, you got so excited that you suddenly commenced the performance out of nowhere!
You take action the moment you decide on something— and that’s both a good and bad thing, you know!
Nonetheless, to avoid being thrown off the ride, we shall accompany you. After all, we are comrades here— and most of all, together we are Ryuseitai—!
… And so, Mayoi-dono. If you could please cease carrying me now…?

Ahh, I&#39;d like to become your beloved ride, Chief…♪

You mustn&#39;t trouble Ryuseitai, Mayoi-senpai. We must remain steadfast in our own lanes, as closing the distance between our cars will surely cause an accident.


Ahh, if that is how the cookie must crumble… However, thanks to you, Chief, I am perfectly settled with an excessive amount of energy.
I&#39;ll be able to appear before a crowd with the others without being frightened.
A thick, protective wall built with the kind bricks of love shall shield me from the ever oppressive wind…. fufufu. ♪


Mhm! It’s always been a hero’s duty to protect those in anguish to the very end!

Chapter 4

(Heheh… I feel incredibly relieved. Even just a bit of distance from you all made it hard for me to see how you were doing, but…)
(I can see clearly now— all along, you’ve grown up to be so incredible. I should’ve been well aware of that already, but I still couldn’t shake off the image I had of you guys when we first met…)
(I need to reflect on myself more than ever… I looked down on you guys in the end.)
(You’re no longer babies who’re helpless on your own— You’ve become splendid adults.)

…Hey, you. Don’t you dare think about slipping out of here all proud and happy — You’re on stage right now, so please make sure to do what you’re supposed to do.

T-Takamine? What’s wrong, you seem kind of angry…? You shouldn’t kick your senior’s butt, y’know?

So sorry about that. It was entirely an accident, my legs are just long.

heheh, it’s because you’re always late to the rescue, chiaki. me and midori start getting irritated the more we wait for you.
after all, we knew for a fact that you’d come over one way or another…
and this performance requires all five of us for it to glow best, so you won’t be helping anyone by stepping back.

Exactly. Just having these M and N tags doesn&#39;t change a thing about us…
You’re still a hero, and a member of Ryuseitai at that, aren’t you? So please don’t go around showing your uncool side.
It’s gonna throw us off if you act so lame… Since you’re still part of Ryuseitai, just like us.
“~…♪”

heheh. you heard him, chiaki.

Yeah… If someone really does end up thinking I’m uncool, it’s over for me. I can’t let that happen when I still want to become a cool hero…

you already became one, you know. it’s precisely because you managed it that the children who aimed to be like you have become so cool themselves.

… You’re right… Or rather, if that’s really the case, nothing would make me any happier.
Nothing that has happened was in vain. I was really able to pass on the most important things I inherited from my own seniors to the next era— Both the passionate spirit of justice, and the shining, radiant ideal image of a hero…!
“♪~♪~♪”

“~…♪”

(Ahaha, I can hear you loud and clear, guys~ They’re just casually talking on stage… That bad habit of ours from Yumenosaki is still lingering on ‘em, huh?)
(Feels like it’s become such a norm to do it that nobody bats an eye to it anymore— like it’s a traditional art or something.)
(But we&#39;ve gotta be keepin&#39; an eye on our audience too!)
(Most of the visitors here are people who love cars. Actual fans of us idols are probably far and few.)
(That’s why we’ve gotta make our charms shine to this new audience during this live show.)
(Or actually, we’ve gotta perform in a way that’ll entertain everyone in here.)
(That’s what I’ll be doing… ‘Cuz there’s no point in pushing my limits and trying to show off… I’m nothing but a klutz, so I’ll walk down my path in my own way.)


(Thankfully, I really lucked out by having so many of the people I do around me. I’ve got Shinobu-kun and Midori-kun, who’ve supported me through the toughest times— and Morisawa-senpai and Shinkai-senpai, who’ll guide me through this new path.)
(I even have the Ryuseitai-N newbies who look up to me and try to catch up to me— along with Alkaloid, as well.)
(And of course, let’s not forget all our fans.)
(All I’ve ever done is pathetically lose my path over and over, but nobody ever blamed me— they only kept supporting me, protecting me, and cheering for me to keep going. That’s why I was able to make this much progress in my life without ever giving up.)
(It’s all thanks to everyone that I’m here right now. At the very least, I’m gonna try to move forward little by little so that I avoid causing any delays!)
(The black flames are the mark of effort! With every single flame absorbed within me, I’ll use them as fuel and make those flames shine!)
(Our flames will sparkle with every color in existence!)


You look amazing, Buchou. You&#39;re in better shape than ever.

…You think so? Ahaha, you’re gonna make me blush.
I’ve always felt so inferior ‘cuz of my empty self.
I couldn’t stand how empty I was inside, it honestly freaked me out… so I’d act tough by lining up all sortsa cool stuff around me.
Not that it changed much—No matter how much cool stuff I covered my body with, I was always gonna be a lame guy inside that hollow shell.
But right now, there’s so many things inside me — everyone’s hopes, trust, and friendship…
And beside me, I have people who opened the door of the dark car I was cuddling myself in, wanting to join me on the journey.
That’s why I’m able to press forward. I’m in no way some empty shell anymore.
I’ve always loved cool stuff. Like the ever reliable, strong Taishou— the mighty and wild tiger, the rough and awesome cars…
Yearning for them, I reached out— and lived my life nuzzling close to them for comfort, if nothing else.
But no amount of cool stuff around me could make me cool. In the end, I was nothin&#39; but a housecat with painted stripes.
Right now, I’m still just an inexperienced, weak, pathetic, lame, boring guy.
I’m no different from some cocky kid who convinced himself he’s strong just by taking a joyride in a huge, sturdy car.


I plan to work hard in recognizing that about myself, accepting it, and then changing how I am.
Just like how I dealt with the newbies— I’m gonna rip off any signs of stubborn pride, and challenge the world as myself.
So that I truly become cool— and become an actual man among men, one that everyone can look up to and see as their role model.
I was able to see what’s in front of me a little better by facing reality like that.
And what I saw was— all the newbies showing up to the venue without a single one of ‘em looking down on me or laughing at me.
It just made me think, what was I even afraid of…? I really am just a dumbass… I’ve still got so much ahead of me to learn.
Heheh… Sadly, I’m still too weak to reach my ideal self anytime soon… It’s a tough life to try and become cool, so could you lend me a hand, Hiiro-kun?


Yes, I shall do so unquestionably. We&#39;ll give back as much help as you&#39;ve given us up &#39;til now.
Rather, that is how everyone experiences life, so you don’t have to think of yourself as weak at all.
We too shall push on. As you go along the right road, so shall we follow.
However, as we cannot see yet where we are headed, we ask that you guide us… Ryuseitai. ♪


Ossu! You’ve got it, Alkaloid~♪ Then zip it and follow my lead—
Nah, forget what I just said. Let’s instead go down the path together, while having a blast singing together!
“♪~♪~♪”

Ch 1 - Ch 2 - Ch 3 - Ch 4 - Ch 5


Chapter 1
Location: Time Street


Time: A few days later, at night — On the way home after an all-out practice session with Ryuseitai-N

Huh… So that’s why you’ve been down lately…?
&#39;Cause our newcomers are dropping like flies…
Actually, now that I think about it, we didn’t really have that many people around at practice in ES today…
But I try to avoid talking to them, so I don&#39;t actually recognize any of them well enough to know if that&#39;s true…

Erm, I would honestly like you to try and learn about them, though.
We’re the only seniors in Ryuseitai-N, so we must act as the mediators for our leader Tetora-kun and the newcomers.

Uuu… I&#39;m horrible at that, though… I thought I wouldn&#39;t have to bother with it, especially since Tetora-kun can get along with basically anyone right off the bat…
Meanwhile, I never really opened my heart to anyone until I got to high school… but then you two became such dear friends to me…
That just goes to show how kind and special you guys are…

…You said that so earnestly, you’re going to make me blush…

Huh? Sorry… Did I say something weird?

Ahaha, I thought that I’d be able to get along with anyone, too, since I’m pretty social.
But leading your juniors and being friendly with your peers are two entirely different things.
‘Cuz if I act friendly, they might look down on me instead.
Like, man, every time one of them left the unit, I’d just laugh it off with “Thanks for giving it a shot~”.
I bet if I was cooler and actually had something going for me, then everyone would&#39;ve taken me seriously.
I can&#39;t help feeling super disappointed in myself — I’m lacking in literally everything.

Mmm… So it’s like, that type of personality is perfect as a coworker, but not so much as a boss, huh… Not that I would know.
Though now that you mention it, you do give off the vibe of a boss people would easily underestimate.
You don’t ever snap at anyone, so it’s like, I dunno, feels like you’d turn a blind eye to anything your subordinates do and laugh it off…

Uhhh, why does that not sound like a compliment at all…!? I get angry every now and then too, y’know?

Whaaa… But as far as I can recall, you&#39;ve only ever snapped once…
I know I&#39;m kind of a pain, so… It&#39;s no surprise I get on people&#39;s nerves.
But whenever I’d whine about how depressed I was, or how much I wanted to die, you&#39;d always be worried about me, and mean it, too…
You always gritted your teeth and bore it, all for my sake…
And the one time you did snap, I completely deserved it, really… I mean, anyone would’ve been pissed off at me for that.

Well, nah, it was on me, too. I was so immature about it — I should’ve believed in you and given you time, or maybe even tried to talk it out. Not dump a full-blown rant on you. Man…

But we didn’t have time back then… You could say it went kinda like a sudden car crash…

Ahhh… So that’s what you two are talking about. Repayment Festival, right?[9]
It all went well in the end, but we certainly experienced some harrowing moments…
Back then, I was so worried that there was no way out of our predicament. I was so certain this would be the end—…
That’s why I feel like what we’re going through right now is a hundred times better than back then, Tetora-kun.
No matter how many wounds we receive, they won’t bring us anywhere near death — Instead, what we should do is endure that pain and advance forward.
We should stay positive about this. Shouldering nothing but worries would only crush you, no matter the strength of your fortitude.

Mm… Yeah, I’m not really good at clearing my thoughts up like that, but I’ll do my best to push forward! The black flames are the mark of effort, after all!

Ahaha, haven’t heard that in a while.

Ossu, it’s ‘cuz we haven’t been working as part of Ryuseitai-M for a while now…
I’ve just been wearing the red outfit this whole time, when I don’t even suit the size yet.

Yeaaah, that’s a whole other can of worms…
Are we really sure Morisawa-senpai and Shinkai-senpai are gonna stick around…? Or did they seriously lose all interest in being part of Ryuseitai…

No way, that can’t be it… Or well, I hope not.
Actually, even if that was their plan, then we’re gonna inherit Ryuseitai and the spirit of justice and protect it ourselves.
… Haha, nevermind, I don’t have any right to say that when I’m so pathetic right now…

C-Cease this at once, Midori-kun! Don’t sour the mood after how hard Tetora-kun tried to perk himself back up!
Rin-pyou-tou-sha-kai-jin-retsu-zai-zen!

What the—The heck was that? A spell to exterminate demons or something?

It’s called kuji~[10] Since ninjas recite it so often for some reason, it’s quite well-known to me!

Um, that doesn&#39;t explain why you rattled it off so suddenly, though…? To this day, I still have moments where I just don’t get either of you…
But, well, it’s only natural that I don’t… since we’re all different people.
You might think you can figure them out if you try hard enough, but putting so much effort into it is only gonna exhaust you in the end. So I don’t think you should bother with it, Tetora-kun.
Take it from someone who’s always been depressed. It’s possible the newbies just quit the unit for no real reason, anyway…
And now that they’ve left, they’re not part of Ryuseitai-N anymore. You&#39;ll wear yourself out worrying about them on top of everything else…

Uumyu… But it&#39;s not that I’m depressed or anything.
It’s just that I have to think these things through— I’m the leader after all, the very same guy who inherited the red color from Morisawa-senpai.
Also, if I don’t figure out why everyone’s leaving and think up a solution for it, it’s just gonna keep happening over and over again.
I’d only be wasting all my effort if I don’t figure out an actual way to sort this out.
It’s already bad enough that I waste so much of my time going around in circles in the same spot. I’d like to move at least one step forward towards the right path for once.
Otherwise… I’ll never, ever move forward.

Chapter 2

Time: A few minutes later

Huh… So most people who quit said something about how Ryuseitai-N&#39;s different from what they thought it’d be…?

You got it… I dunno what they were expecting from Ryuseitai, but it sounds like we really let ‘em down…
What exactly they mean by &quot;different&quot; is beyond me…

Hmm… They probably wanted to join us ‘cause they saw what we were like last year, right…?
So maybe they were expecting that they could be like that the moment they joined…

What we were like last year…?
Uumyu~… I’m clueless about how people saw us last year… I was always so desperate to keep up with everything that I barely had a chance to think.
It just took all my strength to stay on foot…

Hmmm… If we were to look at it from an outside perspective—
I suppose we must’ve given off the impression of a friendly, cozy unit revolving around Morisawa-dono, like we’re always having the time of our lives. Or that every day’s a summer festival in full swing for us, perhaps.

Ahh… You kinda lost me there, but I also do get what you’re trying to say.
I’m guessing they were readying themselves to have a blast with friends in sparkling summer festivals.
But in reality, all they’re allowed to do is break a sweat preparing stuff for the festival, like each and every stall…
They’ve just been practicing the basics day in and day out, and even then, they don’t get a big role in our jobs.

Ahh… That would be a disappointment. Though personally, I think preparation can be quite fun once you get used to it.

Yeah, but I bet they just wanted to jump right into enjoying good street food and having fun together…
After all, it’s not like they got to see what went on backstage— and all the blood, sweat, and tears we poured into setting up everything for the festival…
Or how much Morisawa-senpai ran himself ragged with preparations and begging the higher-ups for permission, all for the sake of a festival that spanned only a moment in our lives — they don’t know a lick of it.

…I wonder if that’s what I’m missing…
I have to push myself further and do what it takes to prepare a live show that everyone can enjoy… a festival that’d be exactly what they want—

Oh, no! On the contrary, I think you’re doing more than enough as is, Tetora-kun!
Our objective as idols is to entertain our fans with our radiance — it is precisely because we succeeded in this task that they have grown to adore us.
You’d be losing sight of your goal if you strive instead to gain the favor of your own unitmates.

But it’s gotta be true somehow. I must be lacking in some places.
Morisawa-senpai made sure to make both our jobs and our personal time together enjoyable, so I have to try harder and do the same—…

Ahhh, you’re gonna actually become depressed for real if you keep saying nothing but that…
Man, you’re taking this so seriously… Meanwhile, I’m more than glad to know people are quitting…
It’s exhausting with so many members around… I’ve been getting sick of it, so they can keep dropping out as they like…

Midori-kun, you shouldn’t be saying that outloud, even if it’s how you feel.

Sure, but… You can’t deny that it&#39;s really costing us to manage all our newbies, on top of everything else we need cash for…
Considering how each practice session burns through our L$, we&#39;d be better off without the unmotivated guys…

Nah, c’mon. I mean, last year you kept going on about being depressed or wanting to die or not wanting to do a thing, right? But even then, our seniors never gave up on you.
That’s the sorta unit we inherited, so it doesn’t make sense for us to throw away other kids who don’t feel like doing anything.

Mm… Oh yeah, didn’t you say stuff like that last year too? You’d always talk about how things were different from what you expected…
I think you wanted to be in Akatsuki first, right…? Didn’t you used to complain about that at first? Like, you always looked like you didn’t feel as if this was where you belong.
What made you stop feeling that way? Maybe once you figure that out, we could figure out a solution for your— Or actually, our problem…?

GOOOOOD WORK EVERYONE!

Eep!? What the—Hey, doesn&#39;t that stupidly loud voice sound way too familiar…?

Oh no, I’m sorry, but I’ll have to excuse myself from any alcohol!
I plan to get a driver’s license, you see — I have driving lessons tonight and tomorrow as well, so just having the scent of alcohol on me would be a problem!
I’m really sorry I can’t stay! I’ll be taking my leave now, s—
Oh!? You guuuys…!! ☆

Ugh, he just had to notice us.

My beloved comrades! It’s been so long! Come right on over and leap into my open, loving arms~!
I’m always ready to welcome you! Fuhahahaha!! ☆
Actually, you don’t seem all that energetic, huh? What’s up!?
Are you all feeling well? Sleeping well? Eating well? Keeping the flame of justice burning within your hearts well…!?

Eugh…

“Eugh,” indeed… There is no way anyone could handle the embarrassment of someone loudly calling out to them from across the street… Even I almost want to pretend we’re strangers.

Wazzuuup, Morisawa-senpai~! I hope work went well for you today!

Ohhh! You’re greeting him…! That’s so Tetora-kun-core of you.

What’s that supposed to mean? I wanted to discuss all sortsa things with Morisawa-senpai, so I’m more than happy we came across him.
Also, it’s just natural for sportsy peeps to greet their seniors, y’know?

Ahhh… You know, it’s possible the newbies dislike that side of you…
I mean, a bunch of them are more of the geeky type who love tokusatsu shows, sooo…

You guuuys~! What’re you talking about!? Yell back your responses, or I won’t be able to hear you! Let me in your conversations! Share with me your experiences!

Holy crap… It&#39;s been so long that I&#39;d almost forgotten just how annoyingly loud his voice is… Why does he need to yell so much…?
Can&#39;t I just head home first and let you guys deal with that mess of a guy…?

Ahaha, why do you want to head home? It&#39;s rare that we get to talk to him these days; you should join in, too!

Chapter 3
Content Warning: Casual mentions of underage drinking and alcohol.


Bam! The wait is finally over— Morisawa Chiaki has arrived on the scene! Fuhahahaha! ☆

Ah, hey. Your arrival was super flashy and all, but you still waited for the light like a normal pedestrian.
It was kinda like someone dubbing the wrong line in a foreign movie.

Well, if I&#39;d just run around in the dark, I could have knocked someone over! Always be sure to follow the traffic laws, alright? Promise me that!
Anyway, Nagumo, Sengoku, Takamine… Did the three of you just finish up with work?
I’m starving after doing so much demanding work myself, so if none of you have eaten yet, how about we all eat dinner together?
We haven’t seen each other in a long while, so it’d be a great opportunity to catch up!

Erm, it hasn’t been that long… Didn’t we perform together during MDM?[11]
But I guess we didn’t really get any opportunities to sit down and chat back then…
Anyway, we actually just came back from eating dinner. We had some at the ES cafeteria, since it’s cheap and tasty.

Also, to be more specific, we simply had practice today, not work.

Ohh, I see. That’s a shame…
I’ve been doing a lot of work with the TV station nearby, so I&#39;ve picked up on a lot of tasty restaurants around here. I was hoping I could show you some, but oh well.
Heheh, and honestly, I haven’t had the chance to talk to anyone about how my life&#39;s been going lately either.
So I was hoping we could chat like family, but… Kanata isn’t around right now, since he’s usually working at a different place from me.

Oh, really? Wait a sec— I know I’m asking this late, but didn’t you just turn down drinking with some big shots a minute ago?
Do you really have the time to eat dinner right now…? Weren’t you gonna get driving lessons or somethin’?

Ahh, erm, well… That was just an excuse I came up with on the spot.
As a hero who kiddos look up to, I shouldn’t get anywhere near alcohol or smoking.
That’s why I’ve been refusing these kinds of offers as politely as possible.
Not to mention, sometimes you’ll come across someone who&#39;ll lose sense of themselves and try to push you to drink with them… But, at the end of the day, I’m still too young to drink, so I shouldn’t violate the law.
Medicines and such are extremely effective on me, so I imagine I’d black out with just one lick of it.
I do want a driver’s license, though, and it’s how I came up with the excuse, but truthfully… I haven’t had the time to actually get lessons for it.
I blurted out a lie when I’m supposed to be an honest hero… I’ll make sure not to do that again.

Wait, really? You wanted a driver’s license? I didn’t expect that, I thought you were only interested in stuff related to tokusatsu shows.

Yep, I do! The more licenses I have, the more I can do as a stuntman.
I haven’t had the chance to work as one for a while now, since the agency’s always telling me I should avoid getting injured…
But it’s been my dream to be the guy behind the hero mask, y’know?
Sadly though, all I’ve been doing is work completely maskless…
Of course, I’m more than grateful that people appreciate seeing me as myself, rather than as a masked hero, but…
—Wait, sorry. I went straight to complaining even though we’ve only just met up. I’m sure this was too much for you guys… But I really meant it when I said I haven’t had the chance to talk to anyone about these things.

Ah nah, we were ventin&#39; a bit ourselves before you showed up. I’m actually happy to know you do the same.
Y’see, in my head, you’re someone who’s always energetic and positive — basically the perfect hero. ‘Course, it’s only natural you’re not actually like that in reality.

Mhm, I actually complain a lot more than you&#39;d think—I just keep it all in my head. I&#39;m honestly far from perfect, and I still have a long way to go before I’m the ideal version of myself.
I make mistakes almost every day, and I&#39;ve spent plenty of nights lying awake haunted by regrets.
But of course! When the camera’s rolling or the kiddos are watching, I&#39;m none other than the invincible hero! Fuhahahaha! ☆

Ossu… Right, you always were that kinda person, werent’cha?
I really do look up to you. I’m still nowhere near your level, and I haven’t pushed out anything but crappy results…
I feel so awful about it, I mean, you’re the one who put so much hope in me when you entrusted leadership to me…
But right now, Ryuseitai-N is crumbling. It really shows how I’m just not fit to be the leader.
Nothing about me is enough, from my hard work to my capability—

………

Ah—I’m so sorry. I ended up venting… I couldn’t help it, seeing you made me feel so relieved, and…

Nagumo.
Do you need help?

…Sorry?
Ah, um… Nah, don’t worry about it. You’re busy as hell, and we can’t keep relying on you for everything.
We’ll figure something out for Ryuseitai-N on our own.

Hm… Alright then.

(Huh? I didn&#39;t expect him to let it go so easily.)
(I was sure he&#39;d try to jump in and help… That&#39;s what the usual Morisawa-senpai would have done—at least in the past.)

…I finally get how Mikejima-san feels…

Wh…?

Oh, it’s nothing. Anyway, unfortunately because of our status, we’re pulling in a crowd just by talking here…
We should go our separate ways before we make a ruckus in the streets.
Right then, see you all later. I’m really glad we got to talk. You seem to be in something of a predicament—But don&#39;t worry, justice will always prevail! There’s always light at the end of the tunnel, mhm!
Alright, farewell!

…He’s gone. What was that about…? He was acting kinda weird.

I wonder… As always, it feels like you could understand him at first glance, but end up finding out it’s actually the opposite.

………

………
Ahh, hello? It’s me, Chiaki. Do you have a moment to spare?
Mhm, sorry. I know you don’t have much time either, but— I have a favor I’d like to ask of you, Kanata.

Chapter 4
Location: Vocal Room


Time: Next day, at noon

Pardon the intrusion, Alkaloid has arrived!

Shinobu-kyuuun, starting today, we&#39;ll be practicing together for Motor Show! Let&#39;s do our best~!
To be honest, I still have yet to be confident enough to stand on anything save a normal stage—
But if I should hear you whisper sweet praises like &quot;you can do it, I know you can! ♪&quot; in my ear, then I&#39;m certain I&#39;ll be more than fine! It&#39;ll be through one and out the other!

Isn&#39;t that perchance the wrong saying to use in this case?

…How are you all so alive?
I can&#39;t take it anymore! I hate cars! I don&#39;t even wanna see one ever again, there&#39;s no way I&#39;ll be able to get through our Motor Show work at this rate!
No, there&#39;s totally no way I could just &quot;hang in there&quot;!
I was hoping us joining Tattsun-senpai for a ride could be a useful reference point for Motor Show, but… I should’ve never done that!
For half a day, he ravaged the coastline with his reckless driving— ugh, just thinking about it makes my stomach churn!
And the cherry on top is that I&#39;m rooming with a pair of top idols, so I haven&#39;t been able to sleep a wink since I was assigned there… I&#39;m a total wreck health-wise, can&#39;t I take the day off?

That won&#39;t do. I&#39;ve already let Buchou know that all of Alkaloid will be participating— but if you say you truly cannot, then I will consider your request.
Motor Show is rather different from the DreamFes we normally perform in, so I&#39;m counting on you, Aira, and your vast knowledge of idols.

Ughhh, it&#39;s true that I&#39;ve got no idea what&#39;ll happen if I leave you guys to your own devices…
I&#39;ll have to keep an eye on things. Tattsun-senpai&#39;s usually such a level-headed person, but he can really just lose a few screws sometimes.

It’s a shame you feel that way. It&#39;s certainly true that yesterday, I discovered quite a new side to myself whilst I drove—
Oh?

hello~♪

Ah, hello…
Mm? Where&#39;s Shinobu-kyun… Could it be? That all along, Shinobu-kyun was merely a convenient hallucination that I imagined for myself…?

heheh… shinobu and the others will arrive a little later.
they said they needed to explain some things to all the members in “n” first.

&quot;N&quot;… By that, do you mean Ryuseitai-N?

that’s right~ it sounds like they have some sort of strategy.
i don’t know much myself~ i only know what anzu-san told me.
“strategy”… heheh, that sounds so heroic~♪

In any case… Pardon my bluntness, but who are you?

Ugh, you&#39;re as clueless about idols as ever, aren&#39;t you Hiro-kun? You&#39;ve gotta brush up on your idol lore more, seriously!
I mean, everyone knows who he is! He&#39;s one of the Five Eccentrics, as well as the second-in-command of Ryuseitai: Shinkai Kanata-senpai!

The Five Eccentrics—

Mm, second-in-command? Then, are you the right hand man of the leader of Ryuseitai, Buchou Nagumo Tetora…?

oh, no, no. this might sound a little confusing, but i’m the second-in-command for the “m” group.
the graduates of ryuseitai don’t interfere with the “n” side.

I see… I apologize for speaking so rudely, seeing as you being a graduate would make you my senior… May I call you Kanata-senpai?

call me as you like~
…oh?

Wassuuup~! Sorry we’re late, Hiiro-kun, Alkaloid!

It&#39;s alright. It&#39;s proper etiquette in sports for those with inexperience to arrive early and wait upon their superiors, right?

I mean, that&#39;s common sense in the industry too? We&#39;re still rock bottom in ES, so we have to keep our heads low.

There’s no need to be so humble~
… Oh?
Yaaay, Shinkai-dono, you’re here~! ♪

hellooo, it’s me, shinkai-dono~♪ there, there. have you all been good kids?

Shinkai-senpai…? Huh? Why’re you here…?
Motor Show isn’t supposed to have you seniors involved, since it’s a job for Ryuseitai-N—

heheh, no need to be so distant. it doesn’t matter whether it’s “n” or “m” — we’re in this together.
or what i should be saying is— all for one, one for all.

—That’s what Ryuseitai’s all about, yeah?
Does that mean you’re planning on joining this job with us? Weren’t you busy?

not at all. there&#39;s hardly a ripple in my life these days, compared to the stormy seas of last year.
i’ve managed to clear up my home problems at this point~
also, chiaki asked me to take care of all of you.

Morisawa-senpai did…?

yes. it seems like chiaki has finally learned that he can rely on people, too…♪

Chapter 5

Time: Several minutes later

hm, hm~
i see~ so that was the choice you made, tetora? i expect nothing less from our proud heir of ryuseitai~
chiaki always hid his weaknesses, but you chose not to do that, yes?
that already makes you so much more praiseworthy than chiaki.

It was an incredible sight to witness with my own eyes.
Tetora-kun pleaded with the newcomers to gather for a meeting, and then confessed his true feelings to them.
He admitted that he’s still nowhere near as capable as Morisawa-dono— that he’s still an inexperienced, pathetic, thick-headed idiot of a leader…
He apologized for disappointing them when they were so excited to be part of Ryuseitai—
And he stated that he&#39;ll never match up to Morisawa-dono, no matter how hard he tries to change himself.
It would have sounded like a bunch of whining from anyone else, but Tetora-kun spoke to them earnestly, bowing his head low.
The confession was just like him, straightforward and honest. He was in tears afterwards, believing he was pathetic; but to me, he looked incredibly cool.

yes, that is a hundred times cooler than the past chiaki, who’d always put up a strong front~♪

…Shinkai-dono, you have moments when you speak very harshly about Morisawa-dono…

ehe, it’s how i show my love~♪
but… i see. so tetora took off his mask and showed his true self to them, didn’t he?
that’s not something just anyone can do — after all, it’s terrifying to fail to meet someone’s expectations.
that’s why i believe you did a wonderful job, tetora. you know what was most important to do…
not only that… you must have spoken to shinobu and midori about it until you finally understood it, yes?
while some parts of you may be exactly like chiaki, it’s impossible for a human being to be fully identical to another.
of course, that’s common sense but… it’s easy to forget that sometimes, isn’t it?
but our differences are what make us special, and that’s one of ryuseitai&#39;s strengths.
we’re so much stronger than we would be alone because of all these different colors coexisting with each other.

Nihihi, it was you seniors who taught us all of that!

Ahhh, Chief, the way you laughed just now was sososo charmiiiing! Once more, please, laugh just once more, for the love of all that is holy…!

Mayoi-dono, your Chief is speaking about crucial matters at the moment, so do keep it for later.

heheh. a strange person has taken a liking to you, i see.
mm~… the way he smells takes me back…

W-What? Ahhh, I&#39;m sorry to have bothered you anyyy, please just pretend I&#39;m nothing but a speck of dust in the air, O Esteemed Eccentric!

heheh. shinobu took after chiaki when it comes to being liked by a strange person, i see.
each one of you is taking after us in your own way — that makes me very, very happy.
i’m so glad i became human. it’s so warm and cozy…
but that aside, how did everyone react to tetora’s confession? did they leave after they thought of him as “pathetic”…?
chiaki always seemed to be scared of that happening to him.

I do wonder, myself… We didn’t manage to get everyone for the meetup, and Tetora-kun only confessed to them a moment ago, so…
It’s too early to know how exactly they felt about it.

ahh… i’m guessing this discussion is why you were all late?

That’s one of the reasons, but it’s also because each of us have been receiving personal work lately.
Of course, it’s quite a trivial amount of workload compared to your own and Morisawa-dono&#39;s.

heheh. it’ll be alright, because we’re all running down the same path.
even if there are times we can’t see each other’s faces, our hearts are still in the same place.
it’ll aaalways be like that, forever.

Mhm! No matter what, we will always be Ryuseitai together.

Shinkai-senpai~? Shinobu-kuuun? We’re gonna finish our warm-up soon, so get yourselves ready for the actual practice, ‘kay~?

okaaay, taichou~♪
ah, but since i only joined partway through… the details are a bit fuzzy in my mind. what sort of job is motor show going to be?

Well… Considering how much of a trainwreck I was in front of all the newbies today…
I honestly dunno how many of ‘em are gonna show up for the actual event… So we’ll have to make sure we’re prepared to perform with just the people in this room.

Heheh, it wasn’t a trainwreck at all, Tetora-kun!

Thanks, Shinobu-kun.
But honestly, I feel like I got the timing all wrong~ Maybe I should’ve done it way after Motor Show was over…
I’m super awkward with these kinds of things, I can’t bottle up my feelings for too long, so I end up needing to spill them out as soon as possible… It&#39;s one of my bad flaws.
Anyways, apparently Alkaloid drove around on their day off and came up with some ideas.
And we have some ideas to share ourselves, so we can start by talking about ‘em first.
The only thing we agreed on is a live show at the end, since we’re idols an’ all…
So we’re basically gonna think through a plan on how to reach that end point for the show.

That&#39;s right. As for the music itself, it seems that the organizer of Motor Show — that is, the client — has been using the same composition for similar events over the years…
I think we could arrange it to better fit our performance as idols, but—
I still don&#39;t completely understand what exactly an idol is, so I would like to hear what my betters in Ryuseitai think.

Ossu! Guess I gotta show off a more senior side of myself, huh? I’ll do what I can~♪

Location: Dojo


Time: Just after summer holidays, during the evening

Taishou.
Taishou, please wake up.

…Gwah—!?
H-Huh? Was I sleeping just now?

Yes, soundly so. Exhaustion must’ve built up inside you.
I was taught that resting is another important aspect of being an idol — I would like you to avoid overworking yourself, Taishou.

Ahh, yeah, uh… I’d prefer not being called “Taishou”, Hiiro-kun.

Hm? Why not? You’re the one who told me to call you that when I first joined the Karate Club in Yumenosaki Academy — am I wrong?
I’d rather you not amend your words so frequently, as it will only confuse me.

Uumyu… I was young and dumb when I said that. Like, I psyched myself up and acted way too cocky, ‘cause I thought I had to inherit the role of Taishou, so…[1]
Basically, I just want you to forget about it. It was such an embarrassing moment for me.
I’m not skilled enough to be called “Taishou”. I mean, when you first joined, I literally got obliterated by you in the exhibition match.
But, well, I guess it was my own fault for having my guard down.

No, that was my blunder. I wasn’t aware of the rules for the so-called “exhibition match”.
I was taught in the dojo of my hometown that in battle, I must fight with the intent to kill — and did not properly hold back my strength.
However, while I had charged at you earnestly, and thus took you completely by surprise—
You were still able to turn things to your favor with a counterattack, even after being struck so many times. You’re a splendid martial artist, Taishou.
Hehe, the other club members could tell something was wrong, so they came over to stop us… But it makes me wonder: if we had kept going, who would’ve won that fight?
As you’re the more experienced one between us, maybe the judge’s fan would have been raised to your victory?[2]

No, really, could you drop the “Taishou” thing already…? I’d prefer you calling me by “Buchou”[3], or just “Tetora-kun”, since we’re both the same age.

Mm, very well then, “Buchou”… You are quite particular about such things, aren’t you? You seem to be more broad-minded at first glance, though.

Nah, I’m usually all over the place with things~ But I can’t help but get bothered by specific stuff. I don’t really feel like that’s manly of me, though…
…Anyway, we ended up chatting about random stuff, but — did you need me for something?
It’s a bad habit of mine to blabber on ‘til I dunno what the topic’s about anymore!

Hehe, that too proves you’re an excellent martial artist — it is a must to know where one lacks.
I can barely tell where I lack, or rather, I lack the capability to tell, so — I hope to continue being under your care, Buchou~♪
Regardless, it’s nothing urgent. I’ve come for the usual training, that’s all.
There is only so much I can train with on my own, so I wanted to ask if we could spar together, Taish--Buchou.
Though I feel a little remorseful for waking you up from your sound sleep.

Oh nah, I don’t mind. I accidentally dozed off while doing my usual meditation, is all.
Maybe I really have been exhausted, like you mentioned.
I’ve been doing as best as I can while keeping a close eye on everything, but… Lately, there’s such a huge gap between the school’s Ryuseitai—also known as Ryuseitai-N— and Ryuseitai-M from ES…[4]
Like, Ryuseitai-N’s been staggering in every way, and I just can’t seem to make things work in the unit… It’s been daunting on me.
Then I just get more stressed about it, and start trying to make an effort out of everything, only for it to all come to waste… that’s probably why I’m this unbearably tired.
Ahhh, I’m just so, so hopeless… It’s so pathetic of me. There&#39;s nothing more wasted than wasted effort.

Hehe, please cheer up, Buchou.
Aren’t you a little too harsh on yourself? From what I heard in school, Ryuseitai-N has been doing well.
Splendidly so, especially compared to us underachievers. There is always someone below you, so look at me and cheer yourself up.

Nah, I feel like Alkaloid’s already surpassed us… or at least, you surpassed the Ryuseitai that I’m the leader of.
Didn’t you guys go all out in the MDM?
You guys’re being called the “supernova of hope”. I’m sure you’ve got a lot of clients wanting you by now.
Actually, are you sure it’s okay to slack off here?

Mmm… No, I don’t think it is.
We may have been able to overcome a crisis by successfully paying our debt, and avoided being evicted out of ES for the time being, but—
I believe that we’re still at the very first step of being idols.
But due to overworking ourselves, the rest of the members are completely exhausted… though, I’m doing quite alright, due to my immensely large amount of stamina.
Thus, I don’t think we can do anything as a unit right now.
On the other hand, I do feel as though all our efforts would be in vain if we were to not take every opportunity that we have while the spotlight is still on us…

Ahaha, things aren’t going well for the both of us, huh…♪

Chapter 1
Content Warning: Stalking depiction and casual suicide mention.

Location: Dojo


Hup! Haa! Hup-nnh!

……


Ossu! Ossuossu—oooossu! OOOOOOOOO—SSU!

…Buchou, you speak too much while you’re doing a set of kumite[5], don’t you think…?
It’s too dangerous to speak right now; we’re both moving rather intensely. You’ll accidentally bite your tongue if you get hit on the jaw, you know?

Ohh, Taishou also said the same thing to me. Ah— When I say Taishou, I don’t mean myself, but actually—

Mhm. You mean Kiryu Kuro-senpai from Akatsuki, correct? He was a member of the club until he graduated last year.
I haven’t interacted with him much so I don&#39;t know him very well— actually, no, I have become more knowledgeable about him through you, since you often speak about him.
You must really respect this “Taishou” of yours, Buchou.
I would much appreciate getting to have a match with him, at least once. One only forges himself by constantly taking on difficult challenges, after all.

I totally agree. Oh, wait, hey— Aren’t you also talking while sparring? ♪

Hm, well, we are currently outside of each other’s sparring distance.
However, I once heard that by being vocal, you can relieve the unnecessary tension in your muscles and maximize your power output — So I suppose it depends on how you use your voice?

Hehe, have you been doing combat sports for a long time? That’s how you sound. But you’re new to karate, right?
Like, you seem to have done a type of combat sport I’ve never heard of before in your hometown.

Yes, it was called the Fist of Amaterasu Oomikami.[6]

The more you talk about it, the fishier it sounds…

Do you think so…? It seems as though my combat style—and anything else that was normal to me in my hometown—doesn’t exist in the city…
In fact, I’m constantly bewildered by many things I’ve never once seen before in my hometown.
For example, cars and vehicles.
When I first saw one, I was shocked and terrified — I thought a metal box was running on its own.

Ahaha, man, which era did you even come from?
Well, to be fair, young people barely even drive nowadays, soo~?

Pardon me! Tetora-kun, Tetora-kun! I’ve come bearing wonderful news~!

Woah—! You surprised me… C’mon Shinobu-kun, you gotta bow before entering the dojo!

Ahh, my apologies! I’m the type of ninja who’s quite ignorant to old-fashioned etiquette!
Were this a certain era, I would have been decapitated! Thank the heavens it isn’t!

No, no, I’d obviously never go that f—
Eeek!?

………

…Shinobu-kun, I see some sorta spirit behind you, like it’s haunting you…

Huh?! Don’t speak of something so terrifying! Taichou-dono[7] would faint if he heard you!
Ah— I meant Morisawa-dono when I said that!
We have that one rule at ES to call him as such; I assure you that it isn’t because I don’t recognize you as our leader—

Ahaha, you don’t have to worry about that.
Even if someone else were to recognize me as one, I have yet to recognize myself as the leader, so…
It’s actually way more confusing if you switch between the names, anyway. So you’re free to call me by my name even when we’re at school.

Uurgh, but… but…

Oh? Mayoi-senpai! He’s not a spirit haunting anyone, Buchou. This is Ayase Mayoi-senpai, from the same unit as me.

Ehehe. Please don’t hug me so casually while you introduce me, Hiiro-san.
It frightens me to have our distance shrunken so suddenly; I implore you to get along with me in a much more hesitant, uncertain manner! And carefully — as if you’re handling a fragile object…!

You’re asking for something so complicated, Mayoi-senpai…

Ahaha, Mayoi-dono is in the Ninja Association with me, so we were performing our club activities together in school.
But I had something to inform Tetora-kun about as soon as possible, and so I rushed straight over to ES.


I requested Mayoi-dono to stay behind at school, but…
I see that you followed after me in the end! I never noticed I was being tailed— you are quite the ninja…☆

Huh? Ah— yes, yes. Exactly, this is a ninja skill of mine; I definitely wasn’t stalking you or anything.

Hehe, it looks like you’re enjoying your club activities, Mayoi-senpai. I am too! I was even able to become friends with Buchou straight away.
This just shows that we were able to overcome our hardships and finally enjoy our youth to its maximum extent.
That makes me very happy… Our victory gave us this outcome—this future. We should be proud of that, together~♪


Ngaah, so bright~!? I had been conducting acts simply for my licentious desires, but you’ve been walking straightforward on a life path towards radiance, haven’t you…!?
Ahh, I wish to die! I’m so ashamed of myself!

Nihihi~ Alkaloid gets along well with each other too, huh?
But Ryuseitai refuses to lose to you! For we are all for one, one for all!
And so! I nipped us a job for all our sakes! Since Ryuseitai-N has been in bad shape for quite some time, I’ve found us a chance for a breakthrough!
Go ahead, praise me, praise me~♪
And its name is: “Motor Show”! It’s likely the largest job we’ve gotten so far as Ryuseitai-N…!

Chapter 2

Time: A few minutes later

Hm, so what exactly is this “Motor Show”…?
I can’t figure out the contents of the job through its name alone, although, I’m always unaware of what things mean. Mayoi-senpai, do you understand what it means?

Erm… May I first ask why we are participating in this conversation, as if it’s a completely natural thing…?
I also don’t understand why there are these sitting cushions, tea, and confectionery in the dojo.

Ahaha, the dojo’s sorta hangout spot sometimes, like, it’s slowly becoming a place to chat about all kindsa things.
Our Taishou even does his embroidery here, so~
It’s useful to have stuff like this around so we can relax in the room. Plus, this way we wouldn’t have to keep bringing them everytime we need them, either.

Although you have strict rules about etiquette and respect, such as needing to bow before entering the dojo, you’re much more lax around those types of things— It gives a sense of adaptability.
Though, it’s because we’re a flexible unit and accept everything, that we are Ryuseitai.
Regardless, we have nothing to hide about this topic, and the truth is, we’re a bit short on people for this job, so we’re also searching for a unit that can cooperate with us.
Whether you’re interested in this job or not, I would still like you to hear us out if you have the time to spare, Alkaloid.

Understood, Chief! I’ll make sure to pay close attention and not miss a single word you speak out of your mouth! I’ll even absorb your breath deep into my lungs!
For your breath is so sweet, I have no need for any of these confectionariessss! ♪

…Shinobu-kun. I don’t wanna talk badly about someone I barely know, but are you sure he’s a safe person to have around? I can get him outta here with brute force if needed…?

No, it’s alright. I was also pretty nervous around him at first, but he’s harmless.
He’s very attentive and can do anything — He’s the one and only companion I have in the Ninja Association, so driving him away wouldn’t be helpful to me.

Yes, Mayoi-senpai is a good guy!
He stares at Aira in a strange way sometimes, but he’s far from the type to do anything bad — he’s timid enough to still get shy over small conversations!

Uuu… I’m extremely sorry for being so suspicious and so afraid of strangers…

Hehe, I’m the same as him, so I feel a connection.
Anyway, umm— to put it simply, Motor Show is a car exhibition.
They’re going to announce the new cars they’re going to release and line them up in a spacious area. People will be able to examine the cars and possibly buy them if they’re interested.
And we were requested to be the crowd puller for the exhibition.
While this isn’t a job from ES this time, it seems like we’re free to do what we like for this event, as long as we run it through with the client first.

Ahaha, but even if they say we’re free to do as we like, we probably can’t do it the Ryuseitai way — by putting on a hero show, right?

Ah, but there are instances of that type of hero content, like Kamen Rider Drive.

Ahh, now that you mention it, vehicles do come up a lot in hero sentai stuff too, don’t they?
And I think Kamen Rider has practically done every genre by now, so I think we should be okay as long as we rearrange it a little…
‘Cuz that way, we could make it so that our enemy is a monster in the form of an automobile, or something.

No, no, hold on— The event’s purpose is to sell cars, so I don’t think we should turn them into monsters, you know?
But it’s true that it’s easier to think about it from that angle, so it’s best to mention any idea you come up with, or any existing work.

Yeah, you’re right, since we’re only brainstorming ideas for now.
Oh, that reminds me; there was a monster-like robot called Crazygon in Ultraman, who would eat up cars, and—

………

………

Ah, ‘scuse us. We’re idols who advocate superheroes, so we know a lot about those kindsa stuff…
Especially lately, we would end up talking about hero stuff before we know it for some reason.
I bet it’s very boring to listen to for anyone who isn’t interested in this stuff.

Oh no, I can tell it’s an interesting topic for you two. But I don’t have a single clue what you’re saying, so I don’t think I’ll be able to keep up with the conversation very well.

Ahaha, we were like that in the past, as well.

Uumyu… I didn’t notice how nerdy I was getting ‘til just recently, when my parents pointed out that I’m becoming more like a nerd and got worried for me.
It’s all Taichou’s—Morisawa-senpai’s fault.

Why are they worried? Isn’t it wonderful to be engrossed in something?

Ahaha, you’re right. Shinobu-kun’s into ninjas, Morisawa-senpai’s into heroes… Midori-kun’s got his mascots, and Shinkai-senpai has his marine animals—
They all have such a sparkling look in their eyes whenever they talk about what they love and it’s really charming.

In that sense, I feel like you’re a mystery, Tetora-kun.
I heard that you got into karate because you admired Kiryu-dono, rather than out of love for the sports.
Do you have anything that you can say is just as important as your very own life? Or maybe something that exceeds that, even?
Ah, actually, perhaps it’s rarer for people to already have something like that at such a young age…?

Mm~… Wait, hm, it just dawned on me for a sec—
Something just as important as my own life… Huh, nothing comes to mind, actually…? I guess if I had to choose something, then it’d be Taishou…?

Chiiief~ You’re dear to me— I’m engrossed in you! You’re the apple of my eye…☆

Huh? Ah, okay! Thank you~♪

Chapter 3

(Something more important to me than my own life… Indeed, there isn’t anything specific that comes to mind for me either — not yet, at least.)
(However, I am starting to like idols, and of course, each one of my friends is extremely dear to me—)
(Though they might not be more important than one’s own life… A car seems like a luxury, so I’m fairly certain that there aren’t many people who would buy one when they don’t even need it.)
(I don’t quite understand how it works yet, but to try and sell such an item would be quite a difficult task, wouldn’t it?)
(What is Ryuseitai going to do? I haven’t the slightest idea of how they’re going to achieve that…)

Mmm~ Perhaps I was a little too hasty.
You previously mentioned that you love vehicles, so I jumped to the conclusion that you’d love to take on this job, as well.
I thought you’d enjoy being able to view all the new cars up close, regardless of how the job turns out…
I wanted to see you happy and smiling, because you don’t seem to be so energetic lately.

Shinobu-kun… So I really did look like I was down in the dumps, huh…? I’m sorry, it feels like I really made you worry.
But yeah, I do actually like vehicles. Taishou doesn’t seem to do so well with them, though…
So maybe this is one of the very few things I like regardless of Taishou.
But why did I even start liking ‘em anyway…? Mmm, I can’t remember.
It might be useful for this job if I could remember why, though…

Oh? So we will take this job?
I have reserved, or more like they secured, a spot on the job for us, so we are not officially the ones in charge of it yet…
It’s not too late to take back our word and tell them we can’t do it, you know?

No, it ain’t manly to take back your words.
Plus, I do like vehicles and I am interested in the job, so if you and the others are okay with it, I’d like us to take it.
Looking back on what we’ve done as Ryuseitai-N—
It feels as if all we’ve done is trailing behind, or like, trying to imitate everything Ryuseitai had done last year, but couldn’t actually do that well and ended up going in circles.
So it might be a good idea to have a change of pace and challenge new things.

My interest has been piqued as well. I would like to use how Ryuseitai chooses to act as a reference point.
Maybe it is because you follow your role model diligently and practice repeatedly, but I get the impression that you have an unusually solid foundation.
If I observe your Ryuseitai, and learn from your example, I have a feeling that I will be able to see the proper way to be an idol.

Ahaha, is that how you see it? It felt like we weren’t getting anywhere with anything we were doing, but… Yeah, I’m sure it wasn’t all a waste of time in the end.
We should have managed to build up a lot of muscle.

Indeed, effort will never come at a loss to you. This is something we should also check with our companions, but—
If our schedules align, I would like to observe you from up close while helping you out with that Motor Show thing.

Ossu! Aight then, as a fellow idol unit from StarPro, we&#39;d love to work together with you guys for this job if you’re up for it, Alkaloid!
We’ll show ya the ropes as your idol seniors~♪
Though, uh, I feel like we’re just gonna embarrass ourselves if I make such a strong declaration…

Hehe, you seriously sound downbeat lately, Tetora-kun.
Please cheer up! You’re so down in the dumps that even Midori-kun is worried if you’re okay, you know?

Aghhh, I might be on death’s doorstep then… Even though my enthusiasm is supposed to be my strong point… This is not good.
Aaalright! I’ll do push ups to pump myself up! One, two, three, four— Fake it ‘til you make it!

Um… This conversation has been a bit tangential, so I’m afraid I’m still a bit confused—if I am recalling correctly, Ryuseitai-N has quite a few members, doesn’t it?
Won’t you be able to manage this job yourselves, rather than going through the trouble of asking for Alkaloid’s aid?

Mmm… I’m still inexperienced myself, so I can’t say this in a loud voice, but…
Our newbies are yet to be well-equipped for a big stage, both skills and experience wise.
We were pretty rough around the edges when we first started out as well, so I believe anyone has the capability to shine if we simply let them develop and hone their own qualities—
All the same, maybe enlisting anyone and everyone because of that wasn’t the greatest idea.
They’re all mostly students who’re still clueless and helpless, and weren’t able to go the elite route and join units like Knights.
Right now, rather than a mixed bag of good and bad, it feels as though we have dozens of rocks lying around that’ll only be able to shine if we polish them with intense effort and care.
Though of course, we will be having them assist us with the job as much as possible…

Ahaha, it’s like we’re treating them like they’re not good enough to do things on their own, even though I hated being treated like that the most from last year.
But now that I’m in the “parent” position in the unit, I finally understand how a parent feels.
Actually, it’s amazing how Taichou — how Morisawa-senpai managed to never give up on us and patiently help us grow.
He’d constantly give us opportunities to shine. And even when we messed up, he’d cover for us perfectly like nothing was wrong.
I gotta learn from him… I feel like I’ve hit a wall right now, so I think I should at least open up and talk to him about it.
But… He’s been busy as hell, so it might be hard to do that…

Chapter 4
Location: Floating Garden


Time: Next day, early morning

Ooh, a big job? Let’s do it! I’m just bursting with motivation right now!

Fufu. Honestly, I strained my legs so much during MDM that I’ve been making an effort to avoid excessive use of them since then…
But if we take that into consideration, I have no complaints.
“Motor Show”… If it is a car exhibition at its core, I wonder if our job will include… pardon the strange example, but even if we were to just snuggle up to the cars like paddock girls and amiably entertain everyone, you could also call that “work”.
…No, that may be going too far.

I think something like that would probably be left to professionals… It seems as if we’re acting as the crowd-puller, making sure that things stay exciting until the event is over.

Indeed. The focus will be on Ryuseitai-N; we will probably just be providing backup for them.
Of course, there is still a possibility that Alkaloid’s role within the event will change a bit the next time we discuss it, though.

Fufun, it might be good to shove ourselves into the spotlight before Ryuseitai can and steal all the guests’ attention from them, though ♪

Ooh… You’re getting ahead of yourself, but in a good way, Aira-san. I think that’s a lovely thing.
You seem to be quite burdened by various complexes… it makes me worry when you become unusually subservient at times.

Ahaha… I mean, I wasn’t popular at all as an idol, so…
But as part of Alkaloid, I’ve been able to play an active role in all sorts of stuff, like MDM.
It feels like I can finally do the dazzling idol activities I’ve always dreamed of… I’m super pumped up! ♪
I’ll launch myself at whatever job we’re given, no matter what it is!
You did sooooo well, Hiro-kun! It’s amazing how you got us such a nice job! That’s deserving of praise. Good boy ♪

Fufu. It was really Mayoi-senpai’s “Chief”—or rather, the individual known as Sengoku Shinobu—who brought the job to us.

What’s with you using “Chief”? Your word choice is as weird as usual…
Ah, come to think of it… Mayo-san, you joined the Ninja Association, right? Is that why you call the association’s leader, Sengoku-senpai, “Chief”?

Indeed. We met by chance, led by the power of love… a dear little fairy that calls himself a ninja ♪

And I’m in the Karate Club!
You’re in the “basket ball” club, right, Aira? What is “basket ball”?

Umm, that&#39;s kinda hard to explain… But eh, I don’t plan on putting much effort into my club activities anyway.
I definitely prioritize our idol activities.
We’ve managed to keep our places as idols for now, so we returned to our classes, but, like… Class feels like a complete waste of time, so I’m always just itching to leave the whole time.

Fufu. Even now, we’re still on unstable footing…
We may have narrowly escaped death, but there’s a saying to “not let your guard down after a victory”, so it is too soon for us to relax; we must keep focused and continue to actively take on work.
Motor Show is a very timely offer for us.

Indeed. It was very fortunate that Buchou casually brought it up while we were training together.
We really got lucky with this! …Ah, I said something that Nii-san usually would.

Ahaha. But really, doesn’t it feel like things are going suuuper well for us?
Even though we were labeled things like “dropouts” and “underachievers” and mocked, it feels like our Cinderella story is finally starting! ♪
Let’s do our absolute best! Hip hip hooray~!

Fufu. You really are bursting with motivation, aren’t you. It’s reassuring to see, Aira.
I am admittedly a bit concerned about Motor Show’s theme… Cars are something I know little to nothing about.

Ah, I have a driver’s license, so if you wish, we could all go on a drive together so that you can grow more used to cars?

Whoa, really? That’s sooo cool; just as I’d expect, you’re fuuuull of adult charm, Tattsun-senpai! ♪

Fufu. It is true that in the olden days, it was a way for men to show their status, but that is less common nowadays. I have heard that the trend of youth losing interest in cars has continued to accelerate.
But due to their price continuing to drop, it was easy to obtain one.

Ooh, you even have your own car? Woooow, how bourgeoisie~ ♪

Ah, that isn’t the case; it belongs to my family’s church rather than me.
It is what we use to deliver food to others, so I cannot use it as I please.
I have my leg injury to deal with, so using it would certainly aid in transportation… If I had the money, I do feel it would be good to buy one for my personal use.

Hmm~ Can’t you just buy one with L$? You’ll be able to get it cheaper that way… Though I guess that has nothing to do with being an idol.
You’d lose just about everything if you got into a car accident anyway, so it’s not usually recommended for idols to drive themselves.
Normally, one’s manager would arrange for a studio bus to be used, right?
Well, ES doesn’t really do the kinds of classic things you usually associate with idols, but…
Ahh, I want to ride a studio bus… it’s sooo idol-like… ♪

Hm… you may be able to rent one with L$ if you claim you need it for work?

Oh, maybe? I’ll take a scroll through HoldHands and see ♪

Fufu. We’ve deviated quite far from our initial topic… That’s alright. It’s lovely to see everyone so full of energy.
We who have already once fallen to the very depths have no need to still conduct ourselves as if we are ashamed of it.

Indeed. I have solid faith that we will reach that dazzling future waiting before our eyes.

Chapter 5
Location: Staff Cafeteria


Time: Same day, in the evening

—With that said, fortunately, it appears that Alkaloid is considering participating in Motor Show.
I’m so grateful~ From what Mayoi-dono told me, they’re not as tired as they thought they’d be from their workload during the MDM.
But they do have to keep certain things in mind, such as Kazehaya-dono’s lingering leg pain…
So it’s possible that their fatigue was simply temporarily blown away because of a runner’s high, so to speak.

………

Tetora-kun? Hellooo~? Are you listening to me?

Ah, yea. Sorry. You’re right, I’m just “Tetora-kun” in the end…
I don’t have the right to be called Taichou… I’m the black shooting star, reflecting no light…

Huh!? What’s wrong!? You’re seriously turning more into Midori-kun, Taichou-dono!
I understand how you feel, but please cheer up~!

…Did someone say my name just now?

Ah! You’ve finally arrived, Midori-kun!
I’ve missed you~ We barely get to see each other lately… Were you able to finish up your solo work?

Yeah, I’ve missed you guys too… I need emotional support…
I just keep regretting every solo job I’ve taken… Ahh, I wish I could kill my past self for being so damn careless…

Ack, please don’t lose heart too, Midori-kun! The mood keeps getting heavier in here…!
Both of you, lighten up! You can do anything with enough fighting spirit!

…Heheh. Yeah, sorry, that wasn’t like me at all. Midori-kun made me realize just now that I’m not even decent at being depressed.

Huh? What the heck does that even mean…? That doesn’t sound like a compliment…

It is! I mean, you’re our biggest earner in Ryuseitai-N right now.
That means you stand out as an idol, and now people wanna see more of you. I’m really jealous.

Whaaa… I don’t really stand out, though…
It’s the people around me that’re so peculiar in their own way, it’s almost baffling to see… Meanwhile, I’m just a regular highschooler you’d find anywhere…

Ahaha, no regular highschooler would get chosen over professional models to be the cover page of a magazine, y’know.
It was for a national magazine, wasn’t it? And thanks to that, people have been recognizing you — We’re now getting tons of people coming over to our Ryuseitai-N live shows just to see you.

Uuu… Hate it… It’s all ‘cause of that magazine that I can’t go one step into the streets without someone talking to me…
I can barely respond back in a way an idol should…
And I’m not even interested in fashion, but they still made me do yet another gravure photoshoot for a magazine today…
They put weird sparkly stuff all over my body and then forced me to do a bunch of poses… It felt like I was abducted by aliens…

Hehe, you really seem to be getting a lot of those jobs lately, huh?
You’re super handsome, so I think it’s great that you’re getting the chance to make use of your best trait.
I would also love to work in a job that makes use of my ninja arts, as it is my strongest merit.

Your unique ninja trait limits you a lot from having opportunities to shine as one, huh…?
Yet the wacky thing about this industry is that there’s always a job out there for something…
Ahhh, out of all the jobs in the world, why am I working as an idol…?
I should’ve just inherited our greengrocer shop… I miss all the vegetables.
Not to mention, I could genuinely be motivated to work if I had to advertise tasty veggies or mascot characters…
I literally couldn’t care less about anything related to fashion, so if you think about it, I’m being rude to both the client and the fashion designer by working on these kinds of jobs…

Mhm, mhm! You’ve gotten so much better now, Midori-kun! You’re not acting on your selfish thoughts as much, and you’re being considerate of others!
Wonderful, wonderful! You’re doing a great job~♪

Uuu… Thanks, Shinobu-mama—

Since when was I your mama!?

Ahaha, thanks Midori-kun, the mood’s back to our usual now.
You really picked me up outta that mindset. What a heroic deed you did right there~♪

Huh, I didn’t really do anything, though… I feel kinda bad actually; I just spilled every negative thought I had the moment I got here…
I thought the best choice would be to avoid showing my depressing side to anyone except people close to me, so I ended up building up a lot of stress inside…
I feel like at some point, I’m gonna reach my limit and accidentally let it all out…
But I wanna do as best as I can to fulfill a kid’s dream, so I’ll hold on for longer…

What’re you referring to by “a kid’s dream”?

Ahhh, from what I know, the person who’s been giving him a lot of jobs lately is a multi-millionaire’s daughter.
Apparently, she fell in love at first sight when Midori-kun and I had the job that introduced strawberry picking to people—[8]

Yeah, that’s the one… It’s such a dirty move to have a higher-up mixed in with the general crowd…
I appreciate her supporting me, but her love feels so heavy…
I feel like she’s just been making me into her very own dress-up doll…

Ahaha, what’s so bad about getting a chance to marry a multi-millionaire? Man, this kinda romance talk is unlike you, we rarely get to hear about this kinda stuff~♪

What’re you on about… She’s just a little kid, y’know… And I’m pretty sure she only likes me for my looks…
It’s like I can barely get my point across with her… it really makes you think of a certain someone—

…But if Morisawa-senpai was here, I bet he’d solve all our problems perfectly, no matter what they may be.

Uh, nobody mentioned that guy, though…? Besides, what’s dead is dead; we have to overcome our hardships on our own now.

Hold on a moment! He isn’t actually dead, y’know…!?

As a Ryuseitai member, he is… He’s been doing way more work outside of the unit than I have…

You make a good point there, it does feel as though he’s left Ryuseitai in our hands… And he was very sudden and curt about it—Honestly, this was hardly what I expected to happen.
For example, I can understand Shinkai-dono’s situation, as he has yet to finish dealing with the issue concerning his household, but…
I always thought that Morisawa-dono would work hard as a passionate hero until his dying breath.

Hmph… All his “I love you”’s weren’t true after all; he’s all talk and no action…

No way, I’m sure there’s way more to it than that.
While I didn’t think of him as that type of person back when he was still in school, he’s actually the sort of cunning guy who&#39;s always thinking ahead.
I have to follow in his footsteps when it comes to that…
The only people who can push forward through anything without a single thought are a handful of geniuses and kids under their parent’s protection.
So I gotta start growing up… Not to mention, Motor Show deals with cars, and there was a time when that word was another way to call a guy an adult man…
I won’t be suitable for the job if I continue to stay as a kid.
But… I really dunno what I gotta do to become an adult…

Location: Garden Terrace


Time: Next day

Aight, show us the outfits you’ve designed, Shinobu-kun!

What style did you go with…?


Uuu… I need to show it now…?
I rarely ever design outfits, so it’s a little embarrassing…

There’s nothing to be ashamed of! C’mon, it’s better to make use of your time and show us now instead of being embarrassed!

V-Very well, then… Here goes nothing! Tadah~! This is what I came up with~☆

Ohhh~! This is pretty neat, actually! I can easily tell what the concept is based on.

Mhm, it looks good. It’s so cute…

Huh? Cute?
Ah—! You’re talking &#39;bout the frog doodle next to the outfit, arentcha?

Mhm, it’s so cute. Shinobu-kun, can I tear that part out and have it for myself…?

Oh! You like my partners Peachy and Thunder? Then allow me to draw you something more refined instead of this simple sketch later!

Huh!? You sure!? Yaaay~♪ Promise me, okay?

Heeey! We’re already getting off-topic! We need to finalize the modern ninja outfit by today, okay?

Ah, you’re right. Sorry. I lost track ‘cause of the cute frog…
Umm… I think this design looks pretty good, but maybe it still has the classic ninja style…?

Hmm… Good point. How ‘bout you make the main part of the outfit more like a sporty ninja attire? It could be a jacket or somethin’ instead.

—!! That’s a great idea! It’d look so stylish!

Ehhh…? Where the heck did that advice come from…?
I thought you had no interest in fashion like me…

Nah, I really don’t have any interest in it either, but my roommate Narukami-senpai is pretty fashionable, so she gives me advice &#39;bout a lotta things. That’s why I know a bit &#39;bout this stuff.

Whaa…? Don’t just leave me all on my own…

Tetora-kun, Midori-kun, I tried changing the design based on that idea; what do you think?

Ah, it looks good. It really feels more modern now.

Hmm… But now that I’ve adjusted the clothes, the shoes and such need to match with it, too… Like… this… Maybe?

Looks awesome! Let’s fix up the decorations on the outfit itself, too!

Time passes

—Whew! This should do it.
Hm…? I feel like someone greeted me just now…?

Ahh, Anzu Anego! Wassup~!

Good afternoon. Ahh, you’re asking if this is an outfit design? Yeah, it is.
Huh? Um, the reason we’re working on it is ‘cause—

Time passes

—and so, I’d like to combine ninjas with the current age, in order to promote the Ninja Association.
That’s why we were thinking up a modern ninja outfit together.
Huh? It sounds interesting?
Ehehe~ I have more confidence in the idea now that I heard that from you, since you’re a wonderful ES producer! ♪
What will we do with this outfit? Hmm… I haven’t decided what to do yet, actually.

Yeah, hmm… This doesn’t have anything to do with on-campus jobs, since it’s club-related… and we can’t ask our agency if there’s a job we can do for school club activities…

There’s not much we can do, so we’re stuck in a rut.

Huh? You may have a good idea for combining ninjas with the modern era…? Really!?

What would that be…?

Hm, hm… Ermm, so there’s a trial session booked for a live show that utilizes AR over at ES?
And you’d like us to do this project with it?

Oh hey, that’s pretty cool. Isn’t AR like, a super awesome thing?

T-This is the best thing I could ever ask for…! Are you sure you’re alright with our project being used for it!?

Then let’s make this project even better now while taking that into account!

Huh? You’ll help us sort this all out later?
Ooh, isn’t that nice, Shinobu-kun? We should be able to do way more if Anzu-san helps us out.

Really~!? I’ll think up lots and lots of ideas, then~!

Chapter 2
Content Warning: Brief mentions of stalking.

Location: Historical Village


Time: Day of the performance

Heeey, Anzu!

we’re over here~
…? what’s wrong? you seem surprised.
yes, exactly~ i was able to come on time without any detours~♪ is it really that unexpected?

Hold on, Kanata. That’s only because I happened to stop you in time before you dipped in the pond, and brought you over here.
You would’ve definitely taken that detour had I not found you.

hmph! you’re so boring, chiaki. anzu-san is praising me for being early for once; can’t you let me have this moment?

I don’t think there’s any merit from being complimented for this, though… Plus, you shouldn’t soak in water in a public place. You’ll startle the customers.
Oh, speaking of—Thank you so much for helping out Sengoku, Anzu!
I never expected that we’d get another chance to perform here![1] And it’s even an official job from ES!
Mhm, I’ve heard that this is to experiment with AR live shows. I’m super excited to see what it’ll look like! ☆

if we succeed with this experiment, we’ll be able to perform so many other things~ i’d love to have a live show within the ocean. puka, puka~♪

That sounds interesting! Plus, we’re a flashy action unit, so we should be compatible with this trial.

hm? ahh, you’re right, anzu-san~ the three of them are late, aren’t they?

Hmm… Takamine’s likely rooted in front of the souvenir shop in the village.
Remember when we struggled to get him out of there after we were done with Scroll of the Elements?

oh, i remember~ there are so many of midori’s beloved mascots in there, after all.

Screen fades to another place in the area

Yaaay! ♪ This village really is so much fun to be in~!
I arrived here much earlier than the appointed time, so I went around the place to check things out—
And I just couldn’t hold back my excitement from being here! It’s like I went back in time to my favorite era!
Mhm, it feels like my wings are being spread for the first time in a while~♪
(We had recently been practicing for both the MDM[2] and the Ninja Clan live show…)
(And now we’ve finally gotten through MDM, which was a very important event… so perhaps it’s also because I’ve loosened up a little?)
(—Ah! I shouldn’t relax too much. We’ll have our live show soon. I’ll leave that for after the performance is over!)
Alright then! I’m going to do my absolute best to make people recognize the charm of ninjas today~! Hip hip hurray~! ☆
—Hm? The two people standing in front of that store are… Midori-kun and Tetora-kun?

Midori-kun, it’s about time we go meet the others, y’know! We gotta get going fast!

…Shh. Be quiet, Tetora-kun. I’m trying to decide between which Hanzou-mon[3] plushie I should buy.

Decide between them…? Aren’t they the same?

No, they’re not! Look at them more closely! This one is kinda baby-faced, and this one is smaller and round, right? They’re so cute!

…Erm, they look the same to me…?

Tetora-kun, Midori-kun, you were both here already?

Ah, Shinobu-kun! Wassup~!
Were you about to head to the meeting spot, too?
I met Midori-kun at the entrance, so we were gonna head over together… But then he stopped in his tracks at this souvenir shop.

Ermm… Which one should I go with…? I can’t decide…

How about you decide on one after we finish with our live show? You’re just gonna keep on going at this rate.

Yeah, I guess I’ll do that… I’ll keep thinking about which to take home with me.

I agree with Tetora-kun! If you’re still indecisive, you could go with the one that truly feels right f—Hm?
……(staring)

What’s up, Shinobu-kun?

Hmm, I felt a gaze on me again…

Again? You’ve been saying that a lot these past few days.

Indeed. But there’s nobody around, so it must truly just be my imagination. I’m sure I’ve gotten a bit more sensitive to my surroundings, that’s all.

I can understand feeling that way once or twice, but you’ve felt this way a bunch of times by now… You sure it isn’t something serious? Like a stalker or something…

Ahahaha, no way! Nobody would get anything out of trailing after me!

Huuhh…? I don’t think that’s the problem here…

I’ll be alright! That aside, we should hurry over to the appointed meeting place~ We can’t keep our seniors waiting!

Chapter 3
Location: Ninja Clan Stage


Time: Before the performance

It’s ‘bout time for the performance. I can hear a lotta noise from the audience! Is it alright if I take a peek or two~?
Let’s see what’s goin’ on… Gotta be discreet…
—! Shinobu-kun, look over here! We’ve got a full house! And the stage looks awesome! It’s a whole other league when ES is involved with the implementation, huh~
We specifically invited students from our academy to watch this time around, so we should be able to promote ninjas to people who’d be interested in joining the Ninja Associati—

………

Huh? You were so energetic just a sec ago, what happened? You don’t look so good.

………

Umm, Shinobu-kun? Are you okay…?

Ahh, I think he got nervous when he realized this stage will make it or break it for the Ninja Association.

Well, I almost wanna say there’s no point in being nervous, but is he going to be okay…? We’re gonna be performing real soon.

I don’t think we’ll make it through if he doesn’t loosen up anytime soon…

Hm? You’re actually doing pretty okay, huh, Midori-kun? You’re usually the one who’s super nervous before a live show.

Oh, yeah, it’s ‘cause everyone’s gonna be wearing goggles for the AR live show.
I usually get nervous feeling everyone’s eyes on me, but knowing everyone has goggles on helps reduce the anxiety.

Alright, it’s about time we head out! Are you all ready!?

Y-Y-Y-Yes!

Urmm… Are you going to be alright, Sengoku?
You’re the center of this performance, and we’ll be performing a lot of action moves—
So I’m not sure if we’ll be able to support you properly if you freeze in place midway…

I-I-I-I’ll b-b-be okay…! I’ll make sure to exhibit my prowess in this live show…! In this very live show~!

U-Uh-huh. Are you sure you’re okay? You’re shaking…

shinobu, peace~☆ come on, do it with me, peace~☆

…? L-Like this? Peace…

yes, now bring your hand down here… okay everyone, do a peace sign with me, and then connect your hands together like this.

Alright, then… Like this?

Uhh? This good?

Umm… do you mean like this? —Hm? Is this… a star shape?

exactly. fufufu~ it’s like a starfish, how cute.
shinobu, this is ryuseitai~ every corner represents one of your comrades.
so take a deep breath and relax, relaaax~♪ remember, you won’t be standing on stage all on your own.

Shinkai-dono…
I’m not alone——…
Mhm! I’m alright now!
I’ll absolutely make sure to demonstrate my prowess in this live show!

yes, that’s the spirit~♪

Aaalrighty then! It’s time to commence our “Ninja Association Promotion” mission! Let’s go!

Scene change to the front stage

“♪~♪~♪”

(Ohh~! He’s like an entirely different person now! He’s super light on his feet!)
(Shinobu-kun’s action moves really are the coolest out of everyone!)

(whispering) Shinobu-kun looks more relaxed now. He’s doing an even better job than he did during practice.
(whispering) The crowd is loving it.

(whispering) They really are! He should definitely be able to get people interested in the club—There’s no way they wouldn’t be inspired by him!

(whispering) But I feel like the better his performance, the more likely my sloppiness will stand out… which kinda scares me.


(whispering) What’re you talking about! Instead of making yourself look bad, just match your pace to the performance itself!
(whispering) C’mon now, let’s get this place hyped up, too!
“♪~♪~”

(Ah—he’s gone. Gosh, I wouldn’t be struggling here if that was easy to do, y’know…)


(But I know Shinobu-kun loves ninjas the same way I love mascots, and that’s what made him work so hard all this time…)
(So I guess I’ll do what I can to help him out…♪)
“♪~♪~♪~”

“Shuriken throw, woosh woosh! ☆”
(Nishihi~♪ They’re all surprised by the optical illusion of shurikens flying at them.)
(What do you think? What do you all think about my beloved ninjas!? Aren’t they so cool!?)
(Ninjas are those who devote themselves to their lord, and conceal themselves within the shadows of history!)
(It’s impossible not to love such awesome figures!)
(Courage is necessary to be able to tell others about your own interests, for it’s sad to be rejected or have nobody find interest in it.)
(But my love for them only grows stronger each passing day, so I won’t stop expressing how I feel about them!)


“I am Ryusei Yellow, Sengoku Shinobu! I adore ninjas, and act as the inheritor of the ninja spirit!”
“Do any of you wish to join me in being a ninja~!? Please come on over to the Ninja Association at Yumenosaki Academy for more information!”

Content Warning: Mentions of stalking

Location: Empty Classroom


Time: A week later

………
……Nobody is showing up.
(It’s been a week since the performance, which means today is the deadline that Isara-dono gave me.)
(If I don’t manage to secure at least one new member by today, the Ninja Association will be disbanded forever.)
………
…Mm. Not much I can do anymore… Saddening as it is.
(But I’ve done everything I could—I had everyone’s help in bringing out the best of the best from me.)
(It is truly a shame that it still brought no success, but… I can proudly say that I tried as hard as I could.)
Sigh… I’ll no longer be able to call this empty classroom my hangout, huh…
Ah—
Ahaha, the marks on this part of the wall take me back~ Those are from the time I accidentally slipped during a backflip and scratched it.
One of the teachers scolded me for that when they found out… It was really terrifying~
………
…and I won’t even be able to have memories like that anymore…
I’m satisfied knowing I did as much as I could, but… It’s still rather depressing…
…Getting lost in my thoughts won’t do me any good, however.
Mmm. Alright, it’s about time I report to Isara-dono.
—? Umm? Did I hear a knock on the door just now…? Did Isara-dono grow tired of waiting for me and came over instead?
Yes, who is it~? Is it you, Isara-dono?


………

(…? Um…? Who is this person? Based on his necktie, he must be an upperclassman, but I don’t recognize him…)
(—Hm? I could’ve sworn I’ve seen him somewhere, though… Very recently, even…)
Ah! Now I remember! You’re from Alkaloid!

Y-Y-Yes! M-my d-deepest apologies. Yes… I’m Ayase Mayoi from Alkaloid…

Ahaha, I couldn’t recognize you at all in your student uniform. I apologize for not immediately recalling who you were!

Huh!? No, nonono! It’s all my fault for being barely noticeableeeee…!!
I’ll be sure to make my presence clearer by constantly making noise!

Ah, erm… That would simply cause trouble to others, so I think it’s best to avoid doing that…
That said, why are you here, Ayase-dono?
This may be an empty classroom, but it’s currently being used by the Ninja Association.

Y-Yes! T-That is why I’m here…
Umm… H-Here, p-please take this…

Hm? This says… “Club entry form”…?
Ahh, you’d like to be enlisted? And here I thought I was being evicted from this room in order to disba—
Wait, what!? Y-Y-Y-Y-You’d like to be enlisted!?
Does that mean you’ll join me!? In the Ninja Association!?

Y-Yes…!
I’ve been enthralled by you ever since I saw you at the MDM[1], Shinobu-kyu—I mean, Shinobu-san. Since then, I’ve had my eyes on you twenty-four-seven!

…? Had your eyes on me…?

I-I-I-I’m s-s-s-so sorryyyyyy!! I-I misspoke!! I swear to you I wasn’t tailing after you to eavesdrop or peep at what you’re doing, reallyyyyy!!

D-Don’t worry! I wasn’t thinking anything like that.

Umm… Oh, yes, I know—You see, I was following your activities, Shinobu-san.
I eventually discovered that you were going to perform a live show, so I went to watch it.

Huh!? You even watched our performance!?

Yes, of course I would! I gazed at every single movement you performed until it was burned straight into my very eyes!

You were watching with that much enthusiasm!?

Yes! With as much passion you could possibly imagine! How you look while singing and dancing with all your might is so out of this world and adora—
No, no, what I mean is… I was moved—Yes, that’s the word. My jaw simply dropped upon seeing your performance, Shinobu-san.
Your never-ending love for ninjas even instilled a deep interest in them within me.
That is why I gathered up my courage and came here in hopes of joining the Ninja Association…

………

Eeep…!! I-I was a bother all along, wasn’t I…!? I-I-I’m so sorryyyyy!! I’m so sorry someone as lowly as me wishes to join your cluuuubbb!!

No, not at all~! I’m so happy… I’m super duper happy!
Let’s talk all about ninjas together from here on out!

Yes! If possible, I’d love to talk about you with ninjas!

Hm? What was that about me?

Ahh, no, it’s nothing. It was simply a slip of the tongue… Please don’t mind me.
Um… Does this mean that you accept me as a club member…?

Of course! It’s very nice to meet you, Ayase-dono! I hope we can get along!
I welcome you to the Ninja Association!

Chapter 1
Location: Meeting Room

Hmm… I see.

so you had to deal with all of that~? it must have been rough for you, shinobu.

It really was… I can’t just sit by and watch my club fall to ruins… So I must do whatever it takes to keep it alive…!

Alright, I understand what’s happening now. So you called us over to think up a plan on how to achieve that?

Yeah, basically.

We tried to work it out on our own at first, but we couldn’t come up with anything good enough… so we decided to go back to the basics!

Hmm, what would that be?

We promote the Ninja Association as sincerely as possible one more time!

mm~? what would be different about that? hasn’t shinobu been doing that all this time?

Yeah, he didn’t make anything out of those ideas, but there’s gotta be a reason behind all that!
So we’re gonna brainstorm what went wrong, make improvements on the idea, and try it again!

Yes, exactly. The reason we called you here is because we’d like you to share your knowledge with us.

ehh~? we don’t need to do it this way; it’s too slow. if you so desire it, i’d make sure to do something about it for you, shinobu~♪
but please don’t hate me no matter what happens, okay…?

Um, what’s that supposed to mean!? You’re scaring me…!

Shinkai-dono, let’s do this peacefully! Peacefully~!!

…What’re you even planning to do?

fufufu~ i’m only joking~☆ so no need to worry.

Uuu… your jokes are bad for the heart, Shinkai-dono…
I did almost consider carrying out a nefarious plan like Shinkai-dono at first from the shock of the situation, but…
I established the Ninja Association because I love ninjas. So I want to enlist a member who would enjoy ninjas with me!

Mhm, I understand how you feel, Sengoku! Comrades, right? It’s always nice to have comrades~!
I used to struggle to find friends that are fans of tokusatsu in the past, personally…
But fear not, for those feelings will be enough! You’ll find hope in this situation through your passion alone!

Huh…?

I mean, just look around you!
I struggled for a long time to find tokusatsu friends, but now I have so many of them surrounding me…!

Ermm…? I’m not necessarily a tokusatsu fan, though…?

Why’s he talking like we’re part of the same group…? I mean, sure, I know a bit more about them now, but that’s about it…

Huh!? W-What do you mean by all that…!? Didn’t we talk passionately about it in our school year together!?

That’s ‘cause you always mention it to us after every Sunday… so we just so happened to follow along…?

Yeah, and if we couldn’t watch the episode in time, you’d explain what happened in so much detail that we wouldn’t even need to actually watch it to catch up.

i personally enjoy seeing chiaki having fun, so…♪

Anyway, we may not be fans of it, but… It’s fun once you get down and watch it, and it gets really intense with its turning points. So all in all, I got more interested in ‘em!

Mhm! I can tell we pick up on things a little differently, but either way, you understand the charm of the shows!
That’s why I’m sure there’s someone out there who shares the same passion as you, Sengoku. There’s no need to fret!
We’ll find a breakthrough together!

Morisawa-dono…
You’re right! There’s no chance for me to save my club if I do nothing…
But the chances will rise if I at least try!

Exactly! That’s the spirit~! ☆

But what should I do then, exactly?
I tried to promote the Ninja Association in as many ways as I could possibly think of… but it seems to always attract the incorrect set of people.

Hmm… Let’s see here…
—Do you like how ninjas look, Sengoku? Or do you like the very being of a ninja?

Huh?

Chapter 2
I’d like to know what ninjas personally mean to you.

Ermm…? Are you asking me if I like a regular person wearing a ninja outfit, or if I like the concept of ninjas who conceal themselves?

Hm…? That’s one way to put it… But yeah, something like that.

Then there’s only one way I’d answer that!
It’s because to me, the very form of ninjas and the weapons that they use are cool! But most of all, I think the way of the ninja is a super cool lifestyle!
They endure any and all hardships, and never reveal themselves in the front lines—They devote their all to their lord and carry out their duty to the very end! That’s what I find so cool about them!

Mhm, then the solution is simple. You’ll just need to show off those charms to the right people, in the right location.

…? What does that mean?

gosh… chiaki expresses things in such a roundabout way.

Ahh, sorry, my bad. Basically, I considered where the issue lies…
And I’m wondering if the problem may be that he hasn’t been expressing the charms of a ninja to the right market.

Market…? Umm, so it’s like if you tried advertising vegetables in a butcher’s shop?

Yep. What sort of image do you guys have of ninjas?

Huh? Uhh, I dunno how to answer that on the spot…
Um, I guess I think of historical plays…?

Shinobu-kun is always talking ‘bout ninjas in every single way, so I never really considered it.
But I guess it’d be their history, or like, historical plays… Basically, the old stuff.

That makes sense, considering the historical village in Scroll of the Elements fits the era of ninjas more than, say, downtown or something.
So that was the problem?

I believe so. If I were to use tokusatsu as an example—
Tokusatsu shows go way back, so imagine if the very first tokusatsu show was broadcasted to kids of this generation. How do you think they’d react?
I doubt that it’d be a hit among them. They’d say it’s too old-fashioned, since the current shows are much more high quality with their editing, and the quality standards have risen.
They may call that version of tokusatsu old-fashioned, but they don’t necessarily think tokusatsu itself is.
After all, kids from every generation have watched and enjoyed these shows, right?
That’s because tokusatsu shows have always made sure to adjust the themes and visuals to appeal to the current age.
The current tokusatsu shows are regarded as modern because they used previous heroes as the foundation, and applied the current trends onto their shows.
It’s for this reason that tokusatsu shows have lasted for this long, even if the process and the visuals have changed vastly.

W-Wait a minute, you’re right…!

ohh~ i get what chiaki was trying to say now.
so basically, we need to show off a ninja style that fits the modern age, yes?

Yep, exactly! Ah—but we still need to make sure we appeal the charm correctly.
That’s how you’ll see a glimmer of light at the end of the tunnel!

Chapter 1
Location: Classroom 2-A

Uumyu… I had no idea something so serious was happening while we were just sitting here, messing around playing a game.

Uu… Sniffs, I can’t believe he’d ask such an unreasonable request from me in such a short time… It’s awful.

Don’t look at it that way. You can’t give up before trying, Shinobu-kun!

What’re you on about!? You know all too well how it’s been for me, don’t you? I haven’t been able to get a single club member no matter how many times I’ve tried promoting it!
I’ve participated in a joint live to present a great track record in the club, as well as trained in noticeable areas to catch people’s attention—
I made posters advertising the club as a friendly place to be in, and I even had Midori-kun help me take a club introduction video showcasing ninja arts—[1]
I’ve done every single idea I could think of, and it still wasn’t enough~!

Video… Oh yeah, we did do something like that, huh?
That legendary video was super popular in the club presentation, but it still didn’t get you any new members…

It had no impact as a video showcasing ninja arts, either… People these days are too used to video-streaming websites…

Yeah, nowadays there are hundreds of videos trying to one-up each other to be the next viral thing.
You got a lot of people asking for photos and autographs after that, right?

I’m not some viral streamer!

Why not try making a channel, though? It’ll promote your club, and if you get popular, you’ll make lots of money.

I want club members, not money~!
Sigh… I’ve lost hope after so many attempts…
The only thing I can do now is watch helplessly as my precious Ninja Association fades into dust…

No! It’s too late to give up!

Huh?

Aight, change of plans! Our meeting’s gonna be about how to save the Ninja Association!

Huh? Huh!? A-Are you sure…!? But I’ll be taking away your time…

Oh c’mon now, Shinobu-kun! There’s no need to hold back with us!
And didn’t I tell ya before?

Huh? What?

Dontcha remember? When you mentioned you wanted more club members, I told you that I’d do anything for you in order to make that happen, since we’re so indebted to you.[2]
You’re fine with that, right, Midori-kun?

Mhm, sure. We have time before our on-campus live show, so we don’t have to sort it out by today.


Yeah, and besides! If one person can’t think up something on their own, then with three people we’ll have three heads to brainstorm with—
Which means we’ll be three times smarter!
We’ll be invincible together! We’ll turn as smart as a supercomputer, and come up with something good, don’tchu worry!

This is already sounding brainless, though… Also, I don’t think that’s what a supercomputer does…
Like, are you imagining it like a handy cat robot who can do anything or something…?

Huh? Am I wrong? I thought they were like, super duper intelligent computers or something.
Anyway, the details don’t matter! The point is, we’ll make it through with the three of us!

Tetora-kun, Midori-kun… Thank you so much…!

Time passes

Ermm… So according to Isara-senpai, he’ll work it out for you somehow as long as you get at least one club member?

Yep, so we just need to think up a way to make someone join.

Umm…

Mhm, go ahead and speak your mind, Shinobu-kun!

If only one person is enough, then wouldn’t enlisting either of you in my club do the trick?
I would prefer to perform activities with a new member, but this is a dire situation, so I don’t mind either of you acting as a ghost member, since you already have your own clubs.

Ehhh… I don’t think you should do that…

Huh? Why not? I thought it would be the fastest way to solve this issue…

They’re gonna instantly be able to tell that we aren’t doing any activities in your club.
Sure, your club would be saved for now… But wouldn’t you fall into the same problem again down the line?

Yeah, and we shouldn’t cheat the system. You might get harsher treatment for it, like stricter inspections.

Mmm, I wouldn’t want that happening. I would only throw even more trouble on Isara-dono…

Yeah, so let’s just figure out a way to get you a new member!

Chapter 2
While I understand the solution, I’m not sure where we could even start…

Hmm… Ah—Why not invite one of the Ryuseitai-N newbies? If they’ve joined our unit, surely they’d wanna join in on your activities, too?
This doesn’t sound so hard to solve after all~♪

………

Huh? Why’re you making that face? Did I say something wrong?

…I have already attempted such a thing before, back in April. I tried asking each and every one of them, without any luck.
To make matters even worse, my desperate act to invite any of them into the club was sent in as a complaint, that Tetora-kun even had to order me to stop~!

I-I’m sorry ‘bout that. You desperately trynna get them to join was starting to freak ‘em out… I had to do something ‘bout it.

Whaa, it was that bad…? I guess this idea’s a bust, then.

Also, I’m curious. Did you ever have a promotion that succeeded in gathering a huge number of people? I know they didn’t join in the end, but like, the one that got the most amount of people interested?

I did have something like that, but…

Oh, you did? That makes things easier, then. We can just polish that idea up some more to make it into something even better. Is it the one that showcased what kinda activities you do?

No, I mean Scroll of the Elements, the joint live from last year. Remember when we had a handshake event after the performance?
I was told that I could hand out flyers about my club, so I did as such. That’s when I received many questions and requests from people wanting to observe the club.

Whaaa!? Why didn’t you get someone new from there, then!? That’s such a waste!

Uuu… I was pleasantly surprised to receive so many responses, but…
It was mostly old people who were interested in the Ninja Association, and they could barely walk on their own.
They wouldn’t ever be able to do backflips and other nimble moves.

Oh yeaaah… We did have a lot of old people as guests back then, ‘cuz of the location and theme of the performance.

Mhm, so while I enjoyed chatting with them about ninjas and historical plays over tea, I politely rejected their offer to join.

To be fair, it wasn’t the right place to do that sorta thing anyway… You need students in your club, so why’d you try inviting people over in that live show…?

No, I understand that too, I swear!
It was a desperate measure! I was hoping the old people would pass my flyer onto their grandkids or teens in their neighborhood, and that they would spread news of how interesting my club activities were.
However, I sadly miscalculated the part where they would think they’re allowed to join the club, too.

It’s like a telephone game gone wrong, huh…

I was surprised by it, too…

But I can really tell just how many times you’ve attempted to get new club members. And it still wasn’t enough to get someone…

Exactly… I’m at my wit’s end…

Hmm… We’re not gonna get anywhere like this, huh? Shinobu-kun, how about you try going back to the basics?

Basics…?

That&#39;s how karate practice works! Once you’re more capable of moving your body in a certain way, you start wanting to practice applying that to new martial arts, right? But you reach your limit pretty fast like that.
That’s when you go back to the fundamental steps! You may notice something you weren’t able to recognize in the past!

While that may possibly help, how am I supposed to do that, exactly?

Basically, you should try to get new members through one of your very first ideas.

…? Ermm, but isn’t the whole problem that I’ve attempted so many things and still haven’t found any success? Wouldn’t the same happen again…?

Yeah, I know it didn’t work out for you, but…
Rather than repeating the same thing, try and think about why it didn’t work out. And then you can improve the idea from there and try it again!

Ahhh… so basically fix what didn’t work out, and give it another shot?

Yup! There’s no point doing this in a delicate way. You just gotta pour your passion in and convey the beauty of ninjas to everyone with all you’ve got!

Wow, just what you’d expect from a musclehead… But well, he’s got a point. You’re trying to find someone like minded, so doing it the classic way might work…

A-Alright…! I’m honestly terrified and have no confidence in this, but… I’ll at least try!

Yeah, yeah! You got this, Shinobu-kun!

Actually, wouldn’t it be a good idea to ask our seniors for help, too? The more ideas, the better, right…?

You’re right! We’ll have more options to choose from that way.

Huh!? But both of them are extremely busy… and I would only feel horrible for dragging them into my personal problem…

What’re you talking about? They may be idols, but their real job is to be the heroes of justice!

Yep, not to mention, heroes are supposedly the type to come rushing to the rescue for anyone in need.

Chapter 3
Location: Meeting Room


Time: Next day

Shinkai-senpai and Morisawa-senpai are late… Isn’t it about time for our meeting?

Indeed… Did they have a job to deal with all of a sudden?

Hmm, I think they’d contact us if it was something like that, though.
Midori-kun, didn’t you send them a message yesterday?
Are we sure the date and time is correct? What if they got the time mixed up…

I said I did already, didn’t I? And I did get the timing right.

Huh, okay, that’s weird then… What did you even send them, anyway?


Ermm… My message was—Ahh, here, this one.
Basically, I said, “I, Eggplant Baron, have taken your Ryusei Yellow as hostage. He’s trembling in fear, waiting for you to rescue him from his worries, eeeggy-eggy-eggplant LOL”
“If you want him back, then make sure you come to ES’s meeting room at 1 PM tomorrow. You better show yourself no matter the cost, or consider your Ryusei Yellow doomed to face his troubles forever.”
“P.S. If you truly can’t make it, then let me know, or ELSE.”

How will they get what’s going on like that!? Isn’t this basically just spam!?

I figured something like this would work best on those two…♪

I feel as though the reason they aren’t here yet is because they didn’t understand the situation based on that message…

Ehh~? Nah, I’m sure it’s fine, they got the gist of it. Hopefully…

You lost your confidence by the end, Midori-kun…

Time passes

…Fifteen minutes have passed by now, and they’re still not here.

That’s weird… Wouldn’t you typically come over if you got a message like this? Not me, though.

Yeah, no. I’m telling you, dude, your message just sounded like a prank to them.

I thought they’d gladly come if I sent it like that, though…

Aight, I’ll have to make a phone call to see what’s goin’ on.
I’ll leave the room for a sec—

Fuhahahaha! Fuhaaaahahahahahaha!!! ☆

fufufu, fufufufufufu~♪

Hm?


Heroes always arrive in the nick of time! The wind howls, the sky rages—Ryusei Red!

the water dances, the waves jump—ryusei blue~☆

Ah! Those catchphrases are from Hurricaneger!

They said it so confidently, but I can barely see them posing in the hallway from here…

Heh! ♪ Typically I’d go for my Ryuseitai catchphrase, but I came here with Kanata only, so! We went for something that specifically matches Ryusei Yellow’s interests![3]
Though, it feels sloppily-done with the two of us alone… and we’re still wearing our civilian clothes.
We should definitely be doing this with the proper set-up. Sorry to ask this, but could we change our clothes first and start over?

…Enough, just get in already.

yes, let’s do so, chiaki~ we can’t keep them waiting any longer.

Hm, good point… Right now, we should focus on talking to our juniors above all else!
Alright, so! What’s wrong, Sengoku!? There’s something troubling you, right? You can consult us all you like!

Huh!? You were able to figure out why we asked you to come here through that fishy message alone!? I’m surprised.

Hmm? Ahh—well, it wasn’t entirely clear, but…
Worry not! It made enough sense to me! ☆

fufu, i understood it, too~ i thought it suited us very well~♪

You see? I told you it’d work perfectly on them.

Don’t look so smug about it… You wouldn’t typically understand a message like that, so make sure to type it up properly next time, ‘kay?

Ah, wait, that reminds me! The message was one thing, but you really didn’t need to attach a photo of an entire box of eggplants after it!
Why did you go with an eggplant baron!? Weren’t there plenty of other options among all the vegetables!?

Huh? Didn’t you always say that the stronger the enemy, the better? So I chose something powerful enough for you to struggle with.

Gghh!? That’s not how I expected my words to be interpreted…!
But it is true that I struggled to hold back from blocking you on sight, even when I knew it was you behind the message…!

Excuse me!? You’ve got some nerve to complain about our high quality eggplants… How about I send you a box for yourself, huh?

I-I don’t want it! I really, really don’t!

There’s no need to hold back…♪ I’m indebted to you time and time again, so it’ll be like a summer gift.

I-I’m not holding back anything, though…? While I’m grateful to receive a repayment gift from my junior, I quite honestly would rather you refrain from sending me a box!

Aight, aight, let’s stop here! This is just about eggplants now. We’re supposed to talk about Shinobu-kun’s concerns today!
But I am glad to hear you understood the message, despite how fishy it sounded. I thought you’d brush it off as a prank at first.
I was actually just about to call you guys, in case you really weren’t coming.

Sorry about that. I assure you we were trying our best to finish our work as soon as possible to get here.

Huh!? You two really were busy after all… I deeply apologize for asking you to come here despite that…

fufufu~ there’s no need to worry about that, shinobu.

Exactly! Our jobs are important, but what’s even more so is rushing to the rescue when our comrades are in a predicament~☆
Now then, feel free to speak to us!

Chapter 1
Location: Classroom 2-A


Time: Around the same time, the two are playing a mobile game together

Uwaah, some sort of bird came over. It’s flying over my head, so cuuute…♪

Ah, Midori-kun! You have to keep moving from your hiding spots. If you camp in one area for too long, the bird will come over to you. It’s best you get outta there.

Whaaa… But I’m just gonna be caught by the demon if I leave my spot now…
Plus, this guy here is my only savior in this dim field… I feel way more safe now that I have a friend with me, so I’m fine sticking around here…

No, dude! The bird is bad news! It’s gonna tell the demon where you’re located!
Ah, you see!? The demon figured out where you’re hiding and is now coming for you!

It betrayed me…!? So you were siding with the demon all along!? We were supposed to be friends, you stupid bird…!
Ack, the demon’s heeere…!! I’m scared!! No, nonono! Crap, it’s gonna catch m—Eep~!!

Ahh, you got caught, huh…

Ughhh… That’s it, I’m having fried chicken for dinner tonight… Also, please come save me, Tetora-kun…

Yeah, just wait a bit longer! I’m almost done with my task!
Aight! I’ll make an opening for an exit… Now I just gotta save ya and we can both get outta here!

Waah~! ♪ You really are reliable, Tetora-kun…

—Hm? Ah, Midori-kun, sorry! The demon’s on a rampage right now, so I don’t think I can save you.

What!?

Sorry! But yeah, for real, I doubt I can get anywhere close to saving you, so I’ll just escape on my own.
We’ll both end up being defeated if I try rescuing you, so it’s better if I ensure one of us survives, right?

No, it’s not…! Can’t we both be defeated together?
It won’t be as terrifying if we die together, so don’t you wanna go to the afterlife with me…? We’re friends, aren’t we…?

Uhh, could you not say something straight outta a horror movie…?

And anyway, isn’t it supposed to be a hero’s duty to come to the rescue no matter the situation?

Uumyu… Maybe in reality, yeah, but this is a survival horror game, so I don’t really have any other choice.
Hm? Uh-oh, I don’t have much time left. I really am sorry, Midori-kun, but you’re on your own! See ya!

Ah! H-He really abandoned me… You traitooor~!
I can’t believe I got betrayed by both the bird and you… I’m so depressed…
I’m sick of this game. Why’s it even popular anyway, huh… It’s scary and hard, and I’m just panicking all the time… I can’t emotionally handle all this…

Well, it’s the thrill that makes this game so much fun to play, after all~

Ugh, I don’t want that kinda stuff… Let’s play a relaxing, cute game next…
You get to fish with adorable villagers, exchange items with them, and craft stuff…

But aren’t games like that fun to play even solo…?

Yeah, that’s true, but I want you to try it out. I think you’d get along really well with the villagers who love working out.

I wanna be friends with actual people who love working out, not characters in a game…

Whaa~… I could play this game all day, though… to the point I lose track of time——Hm?
Speaking of time… It’s been a while now since Shinobu-kun got called over by Isara-senpai. I wonder what’s holding him up?

Huh, you’re right. He’d usually contact us if something came up.
Hmm… How about we check how he’s doing if he doesn’t come back anytime soon?

Yeah, let’s do that.

Door opens

Oh, there he is! He’s back.

Welcome back, Shinobu-k—

(sobbing)… uuu… sniff… (sobs)

Whaaa!? H-He’s crying!? W-What’s wrong, Shinobu-kun?

T-Tetora-kuuun… M-Midori-kuuun… W-What do I d-dooo…! Uwaaaaaaaah!!

Gweh!? Don’t tackle me head-on…
Umm… (pats head) T-There, there? I dunno what happened, but don’t cry, okay…?

Uumyu… Shinobu-kun, couldja tell us why you’re crying?

I-It&#39;s ab-bou… h-he, sniff… no l-longer… sniff…
I-I have to p-prepare… t-things f-for… (sobs)

………
Tetora-kun, I dunno what he said, so could you translate for me?

“Giant Baba will no longer be around, so I have to prepare offerings for him”… Maybe?
Shinobu-kun… I know Giant Baba is a famous pro wrestler and all, but he retired waaay long ago.

(sobbing) Uwaaaaaaah…!!

Huh!? Why’re you sobbing even harder!? Don’t tell me that was news to you!?

I really don’t think that’s what he said…

Chapter 2

(sniffs)… I-I think I’ve calmed down now…

I’m sorry that Tetora-kun’s like that…

Huh!? Why’s it my fault!? Uuu… I’m kinda confused, but I’m sorry, Shinobu-kun.

No, neither of you are at fault here…
I’m the one who’s sorry for causing a mess… (sniff)

So what happened exactly?

The truth is—

Location: Student Council Office

G-Get a hold of yourself, Sengokuuu!!! Lemme lift ya back up—Whew, you okay there? Can you stand?
I’m so sorry, I didn’t expect you to faint…

I-I’m alright. I simply lost hold of myself…
Ummm…? So what did you just tell me? Hmm… Hmm? No, no, it can’t be that, right?
Isara-dono, I think I misheard you!
I heard you say that the Ninja Association will disband by the end of summer vacation, but that mustn’t be true, right?

Huh? Uhh…… W-weeell…

Huh? I didn’t mishear…?
A-Ahahaha! Isara-dono, you’re so sneaky, trying to fool me with such a lie~!
Are you pranking me? I’m a simple-minded ninja, you know! I easily fall for them, so you can’t trick me like that~

………

Ahaha… Ha, ha…
I-Is it true? Is the Ninja Association really going to be disbanded…?

…Yeah. It’ll be officially issued right after the summer vacation.

Why~!? Why did it come to this!?

Mmm… To be clear, this isn’t only about the Ninja Association.
The Club Committee was discussing the maintenance of all the clubs with very few members, or no newcomers at all.
I tried to push them to keep those clubs around, but we’re talking about the school budget here, which relates back to the school’s administration… I can’t do much about that, when I’m merely just the Student Council President.
And the Ninja Association didn’t get any new members this year, right? So it was used as an example for the problem.

I-It’s true that I haven’t had a single person ask to join, but…! Even if that’s true…!!
I’ve been doing my absolute best to obtain more members—Actually, more importantly!
I understand that you’re feeling pressured by adults, but! Why did that suddenly lead to suspending the Ninja Association!?
I was allowed to maintain the club even without any new members, so what changed~!?

See, we’ve had a bunch of new clubs this year, so they wanna adjust the amount of clubs we have.

New clubs? Hmm, I have noticed people performing new types of activities lately…
What kind of clubs are we talking about, anyway? If there’s one that’s ninja-related, I could transfer to it.

Ermm, lemme think—There was Dance Club, Bouldering Club, Baton Club, Sepak Takraw Club, and Ultimate Club.

Uuu~! They’re all western-inspired clubs~! Actually, don’t these seem like clubs that wouldn’t get many members in them…!?

Ah, yeah, about that… Apparently they got preeetty popular. There’s like, more than ten people in each club.

Why!? Reality is so cruel…!
Gnngh… I’m the only one who can protect the Ninja Association… It’s being overshadowed by so many other clubs around, correct!?
Then I’m left with no choice but to do whatever it takes to save it, even if it means the destruction of those new clubs… Ninjas are outcasts that endure no matter what gets thrown at them. We’ve always been destined to be stained with blood~!

S-Stop, calm down! Weren’t you supposed to be one of the few people with common sense in this wacky school?
You’re one of the good students in this academy, so don’t say something so twisted~! Please!

Uuu, (sobs)… B-But I… I can’t stand the thought of watching my club disappear just like that…

Yeah, I know how you feel all too well. That’s why I told you about this as soon as I could.

Huh…?

Sengoku. You need just one person. Get me one member to join your club before the official announcement, and I swear I will do something about this…!

Location: Hallway


—Hm? Ahh, this poster is peeling off at the corner.
Ermm… Alright, let me fix this—There, that should do it.
Wait, I shouldn’t be loitering around! I need to head over to the Student Council office immediately!
(Hmm… But I wonder why Isara-dono needed to call me over unexpectedly…?)
(I haven’t been climbing the school walls ever since I became part of the Student Council, so I doubt it’s to scold me for rule-breaking…)
Perhaps it’s related to an issue the Student Council is facing?
If Isara-dono is in a predicament, then I must assist him in any way I can!
I just need to head over there first~! But I shouldn’t run in the hallways, so I’ll be ninja-speedy in the appropriate manners—woosh, woosh~! ☆

Location: Student Council Office


Please excuse me, Isara-dono!

Ahh, hey, Sengoku…
Sorry for calling you over all of a sudden. Since you were still around at school even without any Student Council duties for the day, does that mean you had something else to do?

Hmm, not quite. I was merely going to discuss an upcoming on-campus live show with Tetora-kun and Midori-kun while we still could.
But when I informed them that you asked for me, they were alright with me prioritizing your request first!

Oh, I see… Now I feel bad, sorry for taking time away from your meeting.

There’s no need to concern yourself over that! They already said it was fine, anyway!
That said… What did you need me for, Isara-dono?
I had thought it was concerning Student Council matters, but it seems as though only I have been called over here…?
Have I caused an issue somewhere in the financing by any chance?[1]

Ah, nah, ‘course not. You’re always doing your job perfectly!

Huh? Ehehe~♪ You’re going to make me blush…
…Hm? But then why did you need me here? I can’t think of any other reason…

Ahhh… So, um, you see…
H-Haha, a-actually, how’s it going lately, Sengoku? Hasn’t it been rough in the council recently? Have you gotten sick of it~?

Huh? You mean the Student Council…?
Mmm… It’s true that it’s a lot of busy work, and I do struggle a great deal with project planning and budget financing, and so on…
But I haven’t grown tired of it at all! If anything, it always ends up feeling really worthwhile!
While I do have the opportunity to work alongside my unit members, outside of that, I used to mainly work on my own last year…
There’s the Ninja Association for one, but it was the same in the Broadcast Committee. Typically, only the person in charge of a major announcement would be at the studio on that day.
So being a member of the Student Council makes me feel fulfilled in a refreshing way, since we all have our own role here, and work together to execute tasks~

O-Ohhh…! Is that so? I-I’m glad to hear that!

(Mmm? Isara-dono is articulating so strangely… It’s like he’s avoiding bringing up the main topic…)
(Ah—! Is it something that’s hard to tell me, like asking me to execute a sudden job or chore!?)
Isara-dono! There’s no need to hold back with me!

Wha—!?

As fellow members of the Student Council! I assure you that I’m fully prepared for any hardship!
So please feel free to tell me anything, no matter how difficult it may be!

O-Oh… Alright, thank you, Sengoku. I-I’ll bite the bullet, then.

……(nodding)

…The truth is, the Ninja Association will be disbanded if nothing changes by the end of summer vacation.

………

Aaack!? He fainteeeddd!? G-Get a hold of yourself, Sengokuuu!!!

Ryuseitai Album Countdown
Ryuseitai’s comments during the Ryuseitai Album countdown.
Day 1

Ossu! I’m Ryuseitai’s Ryusei Black, Nagumo Tetora!
Our album’s finally gonna be on sale!
It has all our unit songs in it, including our solo songs.
I feel a li&#39;l tingly about my solo, personally… It’s my first time makin&#39; one, so…
But having my own song feels real special. It gives me strength!
We sung every song with all our feelings, so please listen to them!
Also, starting today, each Ryuseitai member&#39;ll have somethin&#39; to say.
Please look forward to seeing whose comment is next!

Day 2

I’m Ryuseitai’s Ryusei Green, Takamine Midori…
Umm, we’re going to release an album, so… It’d make me happy if you could give it a listen…
I didn’t really notice it until now, but we really have sung a lot of songs, huh…
And this time around, I got to sing a solo for the first time… I hope there’s something in it you could relate to…
There’s also a new unit song in the album, so please look forward to listening to it.
This was Takamine Midori speaking. Please look forward to seeing who’s next…

Day 3

This is Ryuseitai’s Ryusei Yellow, Sengoku Shinobu!
The long-awaited album for Ryuseitai will be on sale in two days~♪
The album contains my own solo!
It&#39;s a song filled with everything related to ninjas, so I would be very happy to know if I was able to convey the beauty of ninjas to you!
Also, each of our solos are unique in their own way.
The album has all our songs up until now, as well as a new unit song, so I do hope you find a song you love!
This has been Sengoku Shinobu! Do look forward to tomorrow~☆

Day 5

Ossu! I’m Ryuseitai’s Ryusei Red, Morisawa Chiaki!
It’s finally the long-awaited album release day!
I’ve also been waiting forever for it to be released!
Have you checked when the store opens? And you’ve got your wallet with you too, right?
Then let’s go[1] to the CD store together right away! ☆
Oh, wait! I have to talk about my thoughts on the album first!
This album is a compilation of all our songs. I’d love it if you could take your time to listen to each song one by one!
When we listened to it again, we talked all about how it reminded us of all kinds of things.
Of how we spent our days performing live shows, seeing so many people smile, and gaining energy from their smiles.
You give us so much energy just by cheering for us — Nothing could make us happier than that!
It’s the very moment that makes us feel extremely glad to be idols! Thank you!
So we wanted to try and show our feelings of gratitude somehow, and—

Hold it right there! Stop!! Taichou, wait a sec!!
You don’t plan on saying everything all by yourself, right!?

Ooh, Black! I know you all have something you wanted to say too, but I got a bit ahead of myself…!

I get how you feel, but we won’t have anything to say at this point…

Well, I wouldn’t have to talk then, so that’d be a lifesaver…

This is the last day, you know? That is why we planned to surprise the fans with each of us saying something.
But in the end, it just ended up as it always does… It is never the way we first thought it through.

now, now. we do not need to be formal about this, anyway. it is much more like us to simply do it the usual way…♪
now then, chiaki. please continue what you were saying, as our [taichou].

Yep! Thanks, Kanata.
Ahem.
Anyway! We were thinking of how we should show our feelings of gratitude to you, and decided to show it by contributing to the final design of the album.
It should be very clear what we did to it, so please do get the real thing and find out what it is…☆
As for us, we’ll continue holding more and more live shows that’ll cheer you right up!
I hope our voices reach you! And if they do, then please cheer for us as loud as you can! It’ll make us happy!
That’s all from us! These were our thoughts on the album’s release day!
Please keep supporting Ryuseitai~! ☆

1-A's Christmas Party, Part 1

    Location: Classroom 1-A


Ehehe, I did it~…♪ I made the perfect sparkly ornament~ Akehoshi-senpai would love to see this~♪

Ooh, that’s super pretty~! ♪ How’d you make it?

Umm, I glued sequins onto a styrofoam, so that it sparkles whenever the light illuminates it~♪
What sort of ornament did you make, Tomoya-kun?

I made a snowman out of felt.
I cut round circles and glued them together, and then used a pen for the eyes and nose! Looks just like a snowman, right? ♪

Waah, that&#39;s sooo cute~! Let&#39;s hurry and set them up on the tree…♪

………


Hm? What&#39;s wrong, Tetora? Aren&#39;t you gonna decorate the tree with us?

Uumyu, lemme just show ya the problem…

Woah—! The washi tape is all over the place… How&#39;d this happen?

Uu… I made my ornament round and all, but it didn&#39;t look good enough without a pattern, so I wanted to try wrapping it with something fancy. Instead, I just ended up with this mess…

Hm, try not to pull out too much washi tape at once. You can avoid tangling it if you wrap it bit by bit. Like this, you go round and round~♪

Woah, you&#39;re amazing at this! But this method’s great, it looks simple enough for a clumsy guy like me~!
Wrap a little bit by bit… going round and round~♪
I-I did it…! I was able to do something right for once~!

Nice, Tetora.

Congratulations~♪

Heheh! I should be able to make a bunch more, now! Oooh, I&#39;m super fired up~! ♪

1-A's Christmas Party, Part 2
Woohoo, that&#39;s another one done~♪ C&#39;mon, Midori-kun, don&#39;t slack off! Help me out a li’l with the candy wrappings, won&#39;t cha~?


Ughhh, why me… We&#39;re all gonna eat them immediately anyway, so why do we gotta go through the effort of wrapping them nicely…?

No, no, no! We&#39;re gifting these to everyone, so we shouldn&#39;t hand them over just like that!

Mm~… I don&#39;t think anyone in our class would mind, though…?
And why&#39;d you even ask me for help, anyway…? I&#39;m pretty sure we have someone else in our class that&#39;s way better at this stuff…

Yeah, but he seems busy decorating the Christmas tree! Meanwhile, you were just sitting around doing nothing, sooo… ya feel me?

Ughh… I can&#39;t say you&#39;re wrong, but…
I was trying as best as I could to avoid being noticed because I didn&#39;t wanna join the Christmas party…
How&#39;d you even spot me…?

Heh! That&#39;s &#39;cause I&#39;m a big brother! I can immediately tell when there&#39;s a lonely kid around~♪

I don&#39;t think it has anything to do with that, but okay…
Meh, whatever… It&#39;s surprisingly fun to tie the ribbons, anyway…♪

Midori-kun, Midori-kun!

…? What…
Mrfhh—!?

Merry Christmas! So, whatcha think? Is my handmade candy tasty?

Y-Yeah… You&#39;re definitely as good as you always say… But are you sure it&#39;s okay for me to eat one now…?

Mhm! I was told the remaining sweets that aren&#39;t for our class are fine to eat anytime~ Let&#39;s take a break and eat some to regain our energy.
We&#39;ll definitely get to eat loads of sweets on Christmas, but…
It&#39;s nice being able to eat them today, too! Feels like Santa himself gets to have a treat of his own with some tasty sweets~♪

3-A's Christmas Party, Part 1

    Location: Classroom 3-A

Keito, look, look~ It&#39;s Mr. Santa~…☆


Incorrigible. Why do I have to wear this outfit, too?

Fufu, you didn&#39;t have to wear it if you were simply going to complain.
We may be having a Christmas party in class, but it isn&#39;t mandatory to wear the Santa outfit itself. You could&#39;ve stayed in your student uniform, couldn&#39;t you?

Hmph. I&#39;ll stand out in class if I end up as the only one not wearing the outfit.
That said, I have no idea how you even managed to get everyone to agree to wear it… We have plenty of stubborn people in our class who&#39;d refuse such a thing. What sort of tactics did you utilize, Eichi?

Don&#39;t make it sound like I&#39;m the bad guy here. I simply requested for them to wear it with all my heart.

Curse you, Tenshouin…! How dare you say that after what you did!?
You threatened to throw Mademoiselle out of the window if I refused to wear the costume!
You took Mademoiselle as hostage not only once, but twice now! And you dare call yourself human!?

Watch it, Itsuki! Quit moving around so much, it&#39;s getting annoying with your arms flailing around everywhere.


Ahhh… I apologize, Sena. I acted too violently for a moment. Your beautiful face hasn&#39;t been injured anywhere, has it?

I didn&#39;t mean it like that. You were just kinda being a pain, that&#39;s all.
Hey, we still have time before the party, right? I’d like to go to Yuu-kun’s classroom for a bit.
Santa Claus is supposed to deliver presents to good kids, right?
Ufufu, so I need to send a present to good little Yuu-kun…♪

Heh, a Christmas present, is it? I myself have also prepared a special, top-class outfit for Mademoiselle.
Truthfully, I have no interest in these clamorous festivities, but I do what I must for her.

Indeed, there is no battle between any of us for today. Join us, Keito, and enough scowling. You should enjoy yourself, too.
Let&#39;s have fun like high school students would. Merry Christmas…☆

3-A's Christmas Party, Part 2
Iiiiiit&#39;s Christmas, Christmaaas! A festivaaal! Hahahahaha…!! ☆


Fuhahaha! Santa&#39;s going to deliver presents to all the good kiddos!

Uughhh, quit moving all over the place.
There&#39;s nothing fun about watching guys mess around… What&#39;re you two so excited for, anyway?

My bad! I didn&#39;t expect to ever have a chance to celebrate Christmas with my classmates, so I couldn&#39;t hold back my excitement…!
Aaalrighty then! How about a present to good little Hakaze from Chiaki-Santa…☆

Ehhh…? I don&#39;t want a present from a guy. Can&#39;t I get one from a cute girl like Anzu-chan instead?
Or actually, I&#39;d like to gift her something. Okay, it&#39;s time for Kaoru-Santa to deliver a one-of-a-kind present to Anzu-chan~♪

Woah, Hakaze! You can’t leave now; our Christmas party is starting soon!
Also, I have a present prepared for her too, so we should deliver our presents to her together!

Moricchi, I&#39;d really like it if you could get a clue for a second.
Ughh, I&#39;d rather be all alone with Anzu-chan than this party~! God&#39;s so mean to me…


Hahaha! You may say that, but you&#39;re in the mood to join the party, too, aren&#39;t cha? You&#39;re wearing the Santa outfit with us!
Merry Christmas! My present to you is this wondrous ornament I bought overseas, Kaoru-san!

Ahaha, this looks really valuable. Thanks, Mikejima-kun~
Oh well… Guess I&#39;ll celebrate Christmas here, too. Merry Christmas~♪

Oooh! Kaoru-san, you got us presents, too!? I&#39;m soooo happy! Hahahaha! ☆

Heheh! I also brought presents for everyone in our class! Merry Christmas…☆

Yeah, yeah, Merry Christmas.
Sigh, Christmas is supposed to be a beautiful holy night spent with lovers, not a bunch of guys…

Now, now! Celebrating Christmas with your friends can be just as fun!

Yeah, sure, though it isn&#39;t really romantic or anything. But messing around on Christmas isn&#39;t so bad either, I guess. ♪

Translation


Um… Ever since we met… and you took my hand…
All the anxiety and suffocation I felt deep inside started to fade away, bit by bit.
And at first, I didn’t get why the world around me was starting to gain color… nor why my life was starting to change every passing day… But I feel like I understand why now.
It’s because every day, you would give me something new to love… with each day being a little more than the last…
When we were happy, we’d laugh together; when we were sad, we’d cry together… When things were rough, we’d work it out together, and when we were having fun, you’d hold my hand—
It’s through those moments that you gave me something new to love…
That’s why I’ve grown to love myself, just a little bit.
I… still don’t fully understand what love is, but… I hope that these feelings deep inside my heart could be called something like that.
Even though I would always immediately give up on anything and everything, this was the first time I ever thought to myself that I don’t want to give up on something. You are the only one I don’t ever want to give up on.
So, um… Could you please continue to stay by my side, forever?
I know I’m still a pathetic, unreliable person… But I truly want to give you all the kindness that I have…
That’s why — I will always love you.

Chapter Index
Ch 1 - Ch 2
Chapter 1

    Location: Running Grounds


…………
(O-Oh no… This is where we were supposed to meet, right…?)
(Uuu~ But no one’s here… What do I do…? Should I call Nagumo-kun…?)
Huh…?
(Is that the transfer student…? Yup, that definitely looks like her…)
(It’s good that she’s here, but we can’t perform our act without Nagumo-kun… Guess I really should call him…)
…………
(Mmm~ He’s not picking up… Oh well, I guess I’ll explain the current situation to the transfer studen—)
……Huh?
(Some bad-looking guys are talking to her, I think…? Whaa… Why’re there guys like that in our school…?)


(Wait, no— This isn’t the time to think! I have to go save her…!)
(Uuu… I have to, but my legs won’t stop shaking… I can’t do it…)
(Nagumo-kun, please pick up the phone…! I can’t do this alone…!)
(Ah— She’s about to be taken away…!)
(Ahh!! It’s now or never, Takamine Midori…! If you desert her now, you’ll regret it for the rest of your life…!)
S-Stop…! Don’t you dare lay a hand on her…!!
(Ahh… They’re glaring at me… Are they gonna hit me…?)
(I don’t wanna get hurt… I’m terrified, and my legs are trembling… But somehow, I don’t regret doing this at all…)
(Maybe I’ve done enough, then… I’m sorry I couldn’t save you heroically, transfer student-san…)

Midori-kun!

(Huh…? That voice… Ah, Nagumo-kun’s here…)
(He’s rushing over here… He’s really just like a hero…♪)


    Location: Hero Show Stage



    Hero show time…

“The red flame is the mark of justice! Burning bright red, the sun of life! Ryusei Red, Morisawa Chiaki…! ☆”

“the blue flame is the mark of mystery! i have come from the blue [sea]~♪ ryusei blue, shinkai kanata…☆ (sparkle)”

“The black flame is the mark of effort! The burning fighting spirit, stained with the soil of the earth! Ryusei Black, Nagumo Tetora…! ☆”

“The yellow flame is the mark of hope! A single miracle shining into the darkness! Ryusei Yellow! Sengoku Shinobu…! ☆”

“The green flame is the mark of compassion… Healing everyone with things like mascot characters… Ryusei Green, Takamine Midori…”

“With the five of us together, we are Ryuseitai…!”

Aghh, there’s way too much attention on us… I said my line, so it’s alright for me to go in a corner where no one can see me, right…?

Ahaha, I completely understand how you feel. I do not want to stand out much, either.
And anyway, Midori-kun, you may say that now, but—
Just earlier, you protected transfer student-dono from the delinquents, did you not? You really stood out in the crowd then.

Ughh… I really wanted to run away back then, though… They were terrifying…
Even I think I managed that way too well… I don’t typically have that much guts in me… Maybe I experienced that thing where you get tremendous courage at any sign of danger…?

You were super cool~♪ All the girls had hearts in their eyes!

Mm~… It’s true that I was the first one to jump in there, but the ones who drove them away were you guys, y’know…?
I’m kinda late on saying this, but thank you, everyone…♪

No need to thank me! I’d be a disgrace as a man if I were to abandon a comrade in danger!
…I made a huge mistake.
When I heard that Taishou was a delinquent in the past… I thought they were super cool people.
But… reality showed me otherwise. They’re not cool at all.
Delinquents aren’t anything like Taishou.
There are super uncool delinquents out there… In fact, it’s Taishou who’s the only exception.
There are plenty who aren’t considerate, and just do as they like… I finally understood that today.

Chapter 2
But, you know… Although we were unable to follow through our original plan, since an actual delinquent appeared…
In the end, we were still able to save a frail transfer student-dono from delinquents.
In a way, something good came from an unfortunate incident. We even managed to get more people to come to our hero show, and now we have a full crowd.

If only this part of our plan got ruined, too… Sigh… I really wish that had happened…

Mm~ I’d rather have this than not having everyone’s attention on us!
We’re idols, after all — It’s important to stand out. We gotta stand out even more, and make this whole crowd remember our names!

Noooo… I don’t wannaaaaa…

Oh jeez, Midori-kun! You’ve been standing out for a while now, so just accept your fate already! Heheh~ I’m feeling super excited~♪


Ossu! I’m gonna sing as loud as I can!
“I’m Nagumo Tetora, Ryusei Black! Follow my lead, everyone…!”
“♪~♪~♪”

Ooh! What a powerful voice! Nice, Ryusei Black! You’re doing great, Ryusei Black…! ☆

Don’t pat my head. The show’s not over yet, so don’t start relaxing.
Also… Sorry for making you feel anxious, Taichou.
I kept saying how much I wanna be a cool delinquent, and never bothered to look around me.

No, it’s alright. It seems like you don’t want to become one anymore, and that’s enough.

Yeah! I’m actually kinda glad I didn’t get to act out my role in the end.
And, seriously… I never wanna come across another real delinquent ever again.
I was almost petrified in my spot when I saw them ganging up on Midori-kun and the transfer student.

But you didn&#39;t stop, so that you could save them. You’re a wonderful hero, Nagumo! You were so cool! I’m so proud of you!

Like I said! Don’t pat my head! Should we even be talking in the middle of our performance, anyway?

No, I’m pretty sure we shouldn’t be.
Ahaha! In our school’s live shows, it’s become a tradition to talk in the middle of them! Looks like it’s now something I do, too!

That’s not funny! We’ve got little kids here, so they might get bored and leave if we keep talking to each other!

That would be a shame! In fact, this is a hero show for kids! We shouldn’t forget about our purpose here!


“Children, watch over our heroic figures! Now then, let’s get this hero show going~!”
“♪~♪~♪”

Taichou-dono is performing with so much energy~ He’s jumping around while singing… Does he not get tired?

Mmm~ I think he’s got a different amount of stamina from us… It frustrates me to say this, but my performance a second ago took a lot outta me, so I’m gonna stay in the back to recover some of my energy.
I’ll leave the rest to you and Midori-kun.

Okay! You lit a fire in us, after all~ All we have to do now is make that fire burn even more!
“♪~♪~♪”
C’mon, c’mon! It is your turn now, Midori-kun~♪

N-No, I’m fine… I’m just gonna stay here where no one can see me…
(Ahh, but everyone’s having fun performing… This isn’t the right time to be fighting against it, I guess…)


(Just what is up with today… Every time I don’t wanna stand out, I stand out even more…)
(Ahh~! Dammit, I don’t care anymore…!)
“♪~♪~♪”

midori~♪

Huh? W-Why are you calling out to me…? Ah, am I in your way…?

no, you would never be in my [way]~ the five of us together are ryuseitai, after all.


people become happy every time we do something. and when people enjoy what we do, we also become happy.
“♪~♪~♪”

(Huh? Huh? Did he call out to me just because I was nearby…?)
(He’s a strange one… But the kids seem to like him…?)
(They’re cheering him on whenever he does a hero pose…)
(Huh? Is that kid trying to tell me to go for it…?)
(A kid just cheered me on… But, that does make me a bit happy, I think…)
(Even I don’t want any of these kids’ smiles ruined… That’s why, I’ll try to work as hard as I can…♪)
“♪~♪~♪”

Chapter 1

    Location: AV Room



    The next day — After school…

Alright, glad to see you’re all here!
It’s time to discuss our thoughts for the school festival! Don’t hold back! Tell me any and all of your opinions…! ☆

Oh, you’re allowing opinions…? Then I say we don’t join the festival…

Well done, Takamine! Glad to hear your opinion first!
But I’ve already handed in the papers to the Student Council! We’re going to do a food truck, no matter what!

Huh? Not a food stall?

Yeah, there were way more food stalls than I thought. What do you guys want for the food? C’mon, c’mon~ Let me hear all your thoughts…♪

Whaa… So you’re just gonna ignore my thought…
You’re the one who was like, “When it comes to festivals, you think food stalls!”, then decided on everything on your own… and now we’re all gonna be dragged into it… How about you think about how we feel…

My bad! I’ll make sure to do things after I’ve talked to you guys about it, so forgive me this once!

puka, puka…♪ what is important is the [present], not the [past]. chiaki has learned his [lesson], so let it flow away with the [water]~
chiaki, i would like [fish] for the truck. sashimiii…♪

Sashimi, huh… Hmm, raw food is probably a no for food safety reasons. Though I could ask the Student Council about it…

Taichou, Taichou! If raw food’s out, then we could just grill all&#39;a it! Leave the grilling to me!!

Sorry to ruin your excitement, but absolutely not. We’ll only have a fire on our hands if you start grilling. You should never, ever deal with fire, okay? Promise me that…!

You’re exaggerating~ Right, guys?

Weeell… After seeing Taichou-dono like that, it’s a little hard to comment……
Ermm, Taichou-dono. Our options will go down if we take grilling off the list.

Um, first off. Can any of you even cook?

I-I have not done it much, but I shall do my best!

i am very [good] at preparing [fish]~♪

I haven’t cooked much, either! But it’s okay! We can do it if we practice! ☆

Ahhh, dammit! So you really didn’t think this through…!
Morisawa-senpai, let’s at least drop the food truck idea… It’ll only be a disaster like this…

Don’t give up, Takamine! We just need it to be food we can make, right? Right, right! Our options have gone down by a lot!

Hmm, how &#39;bout cotton candy? We wouldn’t need to use fire, and we can make it without knowing how to cook, right?

Oh, cotton candy!? That’s a great idea! Alright, let’s do that! ☆

Heheh, it’s a staple to do cotton candy for a stall~ Ah, but we’re doing a food truck instead, so maybe we should’ve gone for somethin’ more fancy?

I’m fine with this. With cotton candy, we could ask for bags with our faces printed on them, and advertise our unit!

Don’t… I’ll tear every bag apart if you do that…

Don’t glare at me like that, you’re scaring me!
Alright, so now that we’ve settled on cotton candy… Our customers might starting feeling thirsty after something so sweet, so maybe we could sell juice, too.

Ahh, I would be glad to have that~ I am in complete agreement. ♪

i am also fine with it~ make sure to have [mineral water] in the menu…♪

Alright, then we’ll do cotton candy and juice. Heheh, I’m feeling more excited now that we’ve cleared up the details~♪

Um, Taichou? Do you have a sec?
Taishou asked me &#39;bout something… If we have time for it, could we also do some patrolling around school?

You were asked, too? Mikejima-san told me the same thing.
It’s a favor to him, so… If they’re in a fix, I think we should help them out.

Oh, really? Then I can tell Taishou the good news~!

If we’re also going to do patrolling, then we’ll need to assign roles. Let’s discuss how we’ll do that next…♪

Chapter 2
Ermm, we have five people, so… Are we splitting up into a team with three people, and the other one with two?

Yeah. Oh, we may as well get people to know our unit while we patrol! Yeah, let’s do that!
If any of you come up with an idea, then tell us all about it…!

You’re dragging us into something annoying again… Who cares about that… Can’t we just patrol normally…

You should care! There are all kinds of visitors coming — We can’t let this perfect chance slide!
For example… Hmm, we could wear a happi[1] with “Ryuseitai” and our names written on it, or carry around signboards… How about it? It’ll attract attention for sure!

Please don’t say stupid stuff like that… People from my neighborhood are gonna come to the festival — I’ll lose all will to live if they see me like that…

Ermm… I thought it was a good idea, though…

Taichou-dono, Taichou-dono! How about doing some sort of skit in the midst of our patrol work?
Something like us saving someone surrounded by delinquents.
I saw a scene like that in the tokusatsu show you told me to watch, so it got stuck in my head.

Oh, that’s a great idea! You’re a good boy for doing your tokusatsu research!! (pat pat pat) ♪

Wawa— Please don’t pat my head~!

It’ll make us stand out either way… Nothing’s changed…

A skit… Then how &#39;bout we do a hero show after?

Oohh!! What a bold idea! I like it! Yeah, we should do a hero show! Let me pat you too, Nagumo…☆

Ughh, no thanks. And don’t hug me, either.

but a [hero show] would require setting up a [stage], wouldn’t it?

Yep. We probably won’t be able to get the usual stage, but we could turn the staircase by the school building into a simple stage.
We’ll advertise our hero show while we patrol. Mhm, this way we can make ourselves known!

Ughhh… Now it got worse…

Now, now! We become stronger with every hardship! That’s what being a hero’s all about…! ☆

We’re idols, not heroes… Wait no, being an idol is annoying too… Ughhh, everything about this is a big no… I just wanna die…

You can’t die! Good things will happen to you if you live on. For me, meeting everyone is one of those good things~♪

You’re so bright that I can’t look directly at you…

We need to decide on the roles for the skit, then. We’ll put aside the hero role for now — Who’ll be the delinquent, and who’ll be the victim?
The delinquent role is the bad guy here, so I’ll do it if no one wants it.

Umm… Could I do it?

What’s wrong, Nagumo!? Aren’t you always saying how you want to become a man among men!?
Why would you want to be a delinquent…!?

Nah, there’s no real reason to it, it’s just… I thought it’d be kinda fun.

O-oh… Well, I’m glad to know you’re interested…

And anyway, it’s not like I suddenly lost sight of my “man among men” dream~

Chapter 3
Alright. I thought we&#39;d have the most trouble with this, but we&#39;ve quickly settled the delinquent role, so what&#39;s left are the heroes and the victim!
We&#39;ll decide the heroes last. Who&#39;ll be the victim? Anyone here wants to do it?

Standing out is a bit too embarrassing for me, so…

Same…

mm… so no one wants to do it… how about i [take] it?
yaaay! mr. [delinquent] is here~♪ would you like to eat [fish]?
[irritation] comes from [calcium deficiency], you see. you should eat lots of [fish]~♪

T-There is no sense of danger… I cannot comprehend why you are recommending him fish.

Then how about if Morisawa-senpai does it…? Though that has its own problems…

Hmm, he would simply try to deal with the danger by himself… We need someone similar to a frail girl, or something…

Girl…? So like, the transfer student…?

Yes, I suppose so. Though I do not know if she is “frail”…
Wh— Ow ow ow!?
Huh!? Transfer student-dono? W-When did you come behind me…? Please stop poking my head like that~!
A-Are you angry at me? I give, I give! Please forgive me~!
Sniff… I suffered such misfortune…
Though… Transfer student-dono, do you have something to do here?

Oh, so you were walking by the AV room when you heard a lot of noise, and came in to check what was going on? Mhm, I see! You came at the perfect moment!
You see, we’re planning this and that for the school festival, and have also decided to do a hero show.
We were just discussing how we’d like you to do the victim role for us.
Akehoshi has told me about it, so I’m already aware that you’re busy preparing Trickstar’s programme for the festival, but… If you could just help us a tinsy bit, then…
Hm? “Yes, I’d like to help if you need it”? Thank you, transfer student!
We’ve got ourselves someone for the victim role! It’s time for the role everyone’s been waiting for — The heroes! Heheh, I’m excited to see who’ll get to be this one~♪


    Location: At the Fountain



    A few days later — After school…

Midori-kuuun! Over here, c’mon~!
Shinkai-senpai said it’s okay to practice near the fountain, so we’re goin’ all out today~!

Uhh, the fountain isn’t his domain or anything, so I don&#39;t think his approval even matters…?

I know, but… He’s always bathing in it, so I thought I should get his permission first.
Why does he do that, anyway? The first time I saw him doing it, I thought he was someone suspicious. I was this close to reporting him to someone.

Ughh… Don’t ask me… Why not ask him instead…

I did, but it got me nowhere… He really is a mysterious one, huh?
Well, whatever, it’s time we start practicing. Transfer student-san isn’t here yet, so you do both the victim and hero role for now!

Don’t just ask me for the impossible… Also, you called her over too…?

Ossu, I did! I asked her if she wanted to join us when I saw her on my way here, and she said yes!
So we may end up doing it together if she finishes her work in time!
Heheh! I’m so grateful that you’re also joining practice, Midori-kun~♪

I didn&#39;t have anything to do at home… And being bored means I’ll end up thinking about pointless things, which would only make me depressed… so I thought I should do something to help me relax, that’s all…
Ughhh… Why do I gotta do the hero role…
I’m sooooo depressed… I wanna dieeeeeeee…

You’re getting depressed either way…
You won in rock paper scissors, that’s why. Can’t do anything &#39;bout that.
Taichou totally looked like he wanted to do it, but he still said, “I lost, so of course I’d give the role to you!”
He didn’t back down from his words, even when you told him you didn’t want it… Kept saying it’s the winner’s right to have the role… It’s kinda surprising that he’d be stubborn &#39;bout these things.
Hm, since you and Shinkai-senpai got the role… Maybe I should’ve asked him to join practice, too.

How about we don’t practice at all…? You’re really into this for some reason, but… It’s kiiinda weird…
I mean, have you ever been this serious about this sort of stuff before…?

Um— Well! My role’s the delinquent, yeah? So I’m not used to it! I gotta pump myself up~!

Hmm… Eh, whatever… Maybe you can work hard for both of us, since I’ve got zero motivation for this…

Ah— Transfer student-san! Midori-kun, she’s here!

Transfer student-san…♪ I’m so glad you’re here… Nagumo-kun pushed on me two roles at once, so I was this close to running away…

&#39;Kay then! It’s time to get ourselves pumped~!

Chapter 4

Yo, yo. Lady, why don’t ya come over with me a li’l?
Huh? “Where are we going”? Uhh… To the school store, I guess?
Oh, you will? Alright then, let’s go~! ♪

Umm… There’s no opportunity for the hero to show up…
Hm, actually, that’s just perfect…♪

And they all lived happily ever after~♪
…Wait! No, no! What’s the point of a hero show when there’s no hero!?
You too, transfer student-san! You gotta start doin’ the scene where you shake me off, y’know!?

Whaa… You&#39;re the one who went along with what she said…

I-I just, y’know, accidentally got pulled in… Look, it doesn’t matter! We’re starting over again!
Yo, yo. Lady, why don’t ya come over with me a li’l?
Whaaa—!?? W-Why’re you grabbing my hand!? Please stop! I dunno how to deal with physical contact with girls~!
Huh? Ahh, this is supposed to be a forceful scene where I grab your arm, but since I didn’t do that, you did it yourself…?
Uuu… I’m so pathetic. I know I gotta be shameless with this, but I can’t do it! I’m too embarrassed~!
Maybe I gotta forget the part where you’re a girl… But, but… you are one, so…
Ughh… Nothing’s making sense to me anymore. Which only means one thing— Midori-kun, you gotta show me how it’s done!

Uh, I dunno what the heck you mean by that…

Well, y’see~ You’ve got a pretty intimidating aura even when you’re just standing still with a blank look.
So you should try saying the delinquent line, too! You’ll totally be just like one!
Ahh, but you’re super handsome, so… I think a girl would gladly follow you instead…?

I’m not made for this, though… I’m too timid… And you’re not timid yourself, but you don’t really feel delinquent-ish, Nagumo-kun…
It’s just an act, anyway… I don’t think we need to be that serious about it…

No way, I can’t just do this casually! I won’t become a man among men like that!

Umm… Was this part of your “man among men” training or something…?
Huh—?

Midori-kun? What’s wrong, why’re you trembling…?

Umm, there’s someone scary coming over here… S-Sorry, Nagumo-kun, but I just remembered I have something to do… Bye!

Huh!? Midori-kun!? Um, he just dashed away…?

Yo, Tetsu. Nice seein’ you here too, li’l miss.

Ah! Taishou~! You came at the right moment! There’s somethin’ I wanna ask you~!

Oh? That came outta nowhere… But sure, why not. I wanna pay back the favor, so ask me anything.

Huh!? Pay me back!? I don’t remember doing anything for you, though…?

You took the patrolling job, didn’t ya? Hasumi’s also really grateful.

No, no, there’s no need for that…! Taichou got the same request from Mikejima-senpai — that’s why it was accepted so easily!

Doesn’t matter, we’re still really thankful. Thanks, Tetsu.

T-Taishou… I’m so happy! Just hearing you say that gets me pumped up to work harder at my delinquent role~!

Delinquent role…? Oh yeah, what were you two doing together?

Oh y’see, we’re gonna do a skit in the middle of our patrolling. I was practicing for it just now!
Um, Taishou! What do I gotta do to become a cool delinquent!?

A cool delinquent…? I don’t get it, but… I really can’t advise you on anything &#39;bout acting.
My bad… I said you could ask me anything, but I still failed to help you out.

There’s never a time you’ve done that! And anyway, I should be learning the ways of a cool delinquent, not asking, right?
I’ll work really hard, and learn as much as I can to become a cool delinquent! So, Taishou! Please look forward to seeing it…! ☆

O-Okay…?
What’s up, li’l miss? They’ve decided on my role for the Cinderella play?

Are you serious!? Who’re you gonna be…!?

The Second Prince…? Was there even someone like that in Cinderella…?
Oh, right, you did mention there’d be added roles… You must’ve been talking &#39;bout this one.
But me, as a prince…? You’re not messin’ around with me, right?

Taishou as a prince, huh~ You’re super cool, so you’ll be able to perfect the prince role~!

I told you already, I’ve never acted before… Oh well, what’s done is done. I’ll do the role.
Tetsu, li’l miss. I’ve got practice to do with the Drama Club members, so I’ll be off.
We’ve both gotten roles we’re not used to, but let’s work as best as we can, yeah?

Chapter 5

    Location: Running Grounds



    Day of the school festival…

Ah— Taichou-dono! Good morning~♪
Ehehe, I thought I was the first one to arrive, but you always come much earlier!

Yep! This is the school festival we’ve all been waiting for, so I woke up as early as I could!

Oh? You two’re here already, huh? Oh well, good morning! ☆

Good morning! …Hm? Nagumo, you came over with Takamine, huh?

Ahh, I met him on the way here, so we came together.

good mooorning~…♪

K-Kanata!? You always arrive on the last minute, and sometimes you’re completely late — Yet you came really early today, huh!?

huh? was i? hmm~ i thought i would not make it on time, so i hurried over here…

That isn’t a problem at all! Anyhow, we’re all here now, so let’s head over to the food truck.

Woohoo~! Can’t wait~♪ This is my first time getting in one, so I’m really excited!

Now then, the truck’s this way. Everyone, follow me…☆


    Location: Running Grounds (Food Truck)


You guys are looking great!

No no, wait… You suddenly told us to wear this so we did, but… when did you even get these?

We’re going to help patrol around the school festival, right? So we got these outfits as reward. And we even have outfits for our truck!

Oooh. So you didn’t ask Taishou for the outfits this time, right?

Yeah, he’s busy with a bunch of stuff, after all. I couldn’t bear to ask him.
Same with the transfer student… I was really unsure of what to do at first, so this really saved us!

(sniff, sniff)… i smell [fish]~♪ excuse me while i go buy some~♪

Wait, wait! Don’t go off on your own until breaktime, please!

…………

Midori-kun~? You’ve been quiet this whole time. It’s pretty scary when you’re quiet and not doing your usual “I’m so depressed, I wanna die” thing, y’know?

Ah no, I’ve been trying to figure out a way to get away from all this…
Ahh dammit, I wish this school festival didn’t even exist…!!

Midori-kun, Midori-kun! We’re getting customers soon enough, so you can’t show that kind of face, okay~?
Everyone would just run away!

Yeah, looks like we got a few customers while we were busy changing. Sengoku, Nagumo and I will patrol around the area, so I’ll leave the food truck tending to Kanata and Takamine.
Right, and we’re off! We’ll protect Yumenosaki Academy’s peace…♪

…………
(Ughhh, they all left… And now I’m all alone with Shinkai-senpai…)
(Mmmm… I don’t get anything he does…)
(He’s been humming some “splish-splash yip-yay~♪” song, so I seriously don’t have a single clue about what he’s thinking…)
(I’m already not that great at communication, and now you’re telling me to tend a stall with a weird senior? That’s just too much for me…)
Huh? Ahh, are you a customer…? Um, welcome…
Shinkai-senpai, I’ll make the cotton candy, so… You should prepare the orange juice…

here you go~ nice, cold [water]~♪

You’re confusing the customer… Let’s change spots, Shinkai-senpai…

fufufu, [white] cotton [candy] is pretty, isn’t it~? but i like [blue] the most. it is the color of the [ocean], after all~♪
here you go~ a bright [blue] cotton [candy], just like the [ocean]~♪

Shinkai-senpai, quit ignoring the orders…
Huh? This cotton candy is prettier…? Uh… Well, if you say so… Umm, thank you very much…
(W-we managed to do it somehow… But are we really going to be okay like this…?)
Sigh… I wanna go home…

midori~ i see you are [sighing]. please take a look at this child, and [cheer] up.

Huh? What’s this?
It looks so cute and strangely mascot character-like…♪

it is a stuffed toy of a [scotoplanes]~ i could give it to you if you like it.

A-Are you sure…? It’s so cute — Isn’t it precious to you?

ufufu. you say that, but you are hugging it tightly, you know~…♪

There’s no way I wouldn’t hug this…☆ Ahh, it’s so soothing…♪
Thank you, Shinkai-senpai. You really are kind—!?
(H-He’s gone! Whaa— Where did he go…? What do I do, what do I do…! A customer’s here…!!)
W-Welcome… Cotton candy and melon juice, right…?
And that customer wants cotton candy and grape juice… Huh? Apple juice, too…?
(I-I can’t…! There’s no way I can do this on my own…!)
(S-Shinkai-senpai, come back…! Ahhh jeez, it doesn’t even have to be him—Someone just come here~!)

Chapter 6

    Location: Garden Terrace


Garden Terrace, all clear. I shall proceed onwards to the next area!
(Ehehe, we received walkie-talkies from the Student Council — it makes everything feel so much more professional~♪)
(It’s much better for me to patrol alone rather than with everyone else, as I excel at collecting intelligence. I’m glad I suggested the idea to Taichou-dono!)
(Fufufu~ This is how I will show my true abilities~♪)
…Hmm?
(Ah! That looks like transfer student-dono! Alright! Time to say hello~♪)

Yoohoo yoohoo, transfer student-chan! What’s up~? Why’re you here?
I’m currently trying to pull in customers to our cafe, see.
Hm? Then I should go to a place where people are around, instead of being here?
Well y’see~ That area’s been left for doggie, so~
I purposely stepped away from that area, and now I got to meet you… I’m so lucky~♪

(Hmmm, someone did it before I could. That person is acting strangely friendly with her…)
(It feels as if transfer student-dono is not sure what to do with him, either. Should I go in there and help her?)

Hey, hey, transfer student-chan. You remember our promise, right?
Mhm mhm, I’m glad to hear that~ I’ll make sure to escort you to the cafe, so look forward to it, ‘kay? ♪

(Ahh—! She is not one to show any emotion, and yet she is making a perplexed face right now…!)
(I-I must save her! But but, I feel anxious doing it alone~! I-I shall contact the others for the time being!)

ding…♪

Ow—!? That was such a soft way to say it, but you genuinely went and chopped me hard, Kanata-kun…!!

ufufu, [naughty children must] be punished~ you should not trouble [transfer student]-san, okay?

“Naughty children”? I’m your age, y’know~? And I’m not doing that, anyway.
We were just having a nice chat. Right, transfer student-chan?

hmm. she is clearly saying otherwise, though?

Whaa~? Sorry, sorry. I wasn’t trying to do that, really.
Ah, and now you’re hiding behind Kanata-kun…
I won’t pester you anymore, so come on over to my side~ Come on~♪

ahaha… she is shaking her head and completely [refusing]. it seems you are hated.

Wha— No, I’m not! Why’d you go and say something I’ve been worrying about, huh!?

you were worried about that? i am sorry, i did not notice.

It’s fine, I guess. Anyway, why’re you here? Didn’t you say you guys were doing a food truck?
Ahh, but you also said something about patrolling, right? What a load of work that must be~ If it were me, I’d have skipped it to go and flirt with girls.

you really love [girls], don’t you, kaoru. but that still does not mean you should flirt with [girls] that clearly do not like it.

Alright, alright. All I gotta do is not bother transfer student-chan anymore, right?

ufufu, let me praise you. good boy, good boy…♪
kaoru, i think i [need] to leave for now.
i left my spot to [rehydrate], but that also means i left midori alone to [tend] the truck.

Guess I’ll leave too, then~ I’ve also left most of the work to Sakuma-san, so~. We may be having our cafe indoors, but it’s noon right now, so it must be rough on him.
Transfer student-chan, see you later~ I await your return, my princess~♪

now then, it is time i head back to midori.

U-Uuuu~ Transfer student-dono~…

huh? shinobu? since when were you here~?

I was here this whole time…
I noticed transfer student-dono was feeling awkward around that person, but I was too anxious to do anything…
It went alright thanks to you, Shinkai-dono, but… I deeply apologize for failing to save you, transfer student-dono!
Y-You forgive me? Ehehe, you are truly kind~♪
Shinkai-dono, I shall return with you. It’s probably time for us to switch places, anyway.

it is that [time] already~? transfer student-san, we will be off now.
please do enjoy the [school festival]. puka, puka…♪

    Location: Dojo


Ossu! Nagumo Tetora, comin&#39; in!

…………

(Ooh, he hasn&#39;t noticed me at all. I think he&#39;s concentrating on something — maybe I should let him be for now…)

…Hm? Oh — it&#39;s you, Tetsu. Sorry &#39;bout that. How long have you been here?

Ahaha, only a second. You’ve got awesome concentration skills, Taishou~!

Nah… I&#39;m just so outta it that I didn&#39;t realize you were here.

Uumyu… Is there something bothering you again?

Mm… It&#39;s more like I&#39;m worried &#39;bout something.
Akatsuki&#39;s gonna help the Drama Club during the school festival, right? But I didn&#39;t expect we’d be helpin&#39; them as actors.
I was just readin&#39; through the script, and—

Uu~ I&#39;m so sorry, Taishou!

…? Why&#39;re you apologizing?

I&#39;m the one who suggested you to help the Drama Club… and now my idea’s backfired on you!
I&#39;m really, really sorry for putting stress on you!

Don&#39;t keep apologizin’. This is my own problem. I&#39;m thankful for your suggestion… It&#39;s savin’ our butts right now.
Now that we’re doin’ it, I wanna get it right, but I&#39;ve never acted before. If it were somethin’ like a delinquent role, though… I could&#39;ve done it without even needing to “act” it out.

Oohh… You’d be super duper cool as a delinquent! I wanna see that~!
Oh yeah, I heard that you used to be a rebel in the past. Is that true?

Hm? Yeah, in the past… Anyways, Tetsu. Did you guys decide on what to do for the festival?

Ossu! We went for a food stall!
We&#39;re still not sure how exactly we&#39;ll do one… But Taichou told us to meet up in the AV room tomorrow, so I guess we&#39;ll be deciding on it then.

That so? I&#39;ll come by the stall if I&#39;ve got the time.

Oh yes, please do! You&#39;re always welcome~!
I also wanna see you performing! I&#39;ll totally find the time to see you!

I&#39;m glad, but I&#39;d rather you didn&#39;t. I don&#39;t wanna disappoint you with bad acting.

I&#39;d never be disappointed with any version of you~

Haha, thanks.
Hrm… A food stall, huh… Maybe it&#39;d be too much on top of that…

Hmm? What&#39;s too much?

See, apparently there&#39;s not enough people to patrol the school during the festival.
I kinda overheard Hasumi talking &#39;bout it… I thought I could help out a little, but — I&#39;ll be too busy with the performance, so I doubt I&#39;ll have any time to patrol.
That’s when I thought maybe you guys could help out instead.
Ryuseitai&#39;s &#39;bout being heroes of justice, so a duty to maintain public order would suit you all perfectly, yeah?
But, well… This isn&#39;t your problem to deal with. Hopefully they&#39;ll find people for the job, so forget what I just said.

No, no! I&#39;ll ask Taichou in the meeting tomorrow!
We may find the time to patrol while we do our food stall… Also, I wanna make it happen since it&#39;s a favor to you!

Thanks, Tetsu. Yeah, could you ask Morisawa &#39;bout it?

Will do! And if he says it’s impossible, then I&#39;ll do whatever it takes to make him say it isn&#39;t! Even if I gotta get on my knees and beg!

Mmm… I know it&#39;s dumb to say this right after asking for a favor, but you don&#39;t gotta if you really can&#39;t, alright?
Right then, time to start practice. You came here for that too, right?

You sure you&#39;re all good for the performance act?

Yeah, they haven&#39;t even decided on the roles, so… It&#39;s only gonna stiffen me up more if I keep reading the script. I&#39;m starting to feel like movin&#39; my body, anyway.

Wooo! I&#39;m so happy! &#39;Kay, I&#39;ll go change my clothes then! ☆

Chapter 7

    Location: Running Grounds


The running grounds is also clear!
Heheh, walkie-talkies are so convenient~♪ This is fun, it’s kinda like we’re in an undercover investigation…☆

Yo, yo. Lady, why don’t ya come over with me a li’l?

Mm—!? W-What’s wrong, Nagumo? I’m not a lady, and your face is kinda scaring me…

Huuuh? Quit your yappin’ and come with me already. Just drop everythin’ you’re doin’ and flirt with me, alright?

F-F-F-Flirt!? Nagumo, what happened with you!? Did you accidentally eat something weird!?

Uh, no, I didn’t. I’m just rehearsing for my role.
Honestly, I don’t really feel like I’m grasping it yet… Just what is a cool delinquent…

Ah, that’s what it was… I&#39;m happy to see you working this hard for your role, but I prefer the usual you.

Oh, I know! Taichou, you’ve known Taishou for a long time, right? Could you tell me what he was like back then? Please!

B-Back then…? Why would you want to know that all of a sudden?
Mmm… I think it’s better if you ask him, not me.

He’ll just avoid the question, though~
Well, whatever. I’m sure Taishou as a delinquent was as super duper cool as he is right now!


‘Kay, I glare like this, and… Hey, hey! What d’you think you’re lookin’ at!? This ain’t here for show~!
Guuuh~!! That was just like a delinquent! Studying all those mangas with delinquents really came in handy~♪

…………

UAAAHHHH—!?

A-A scream…!? Taichou, I think there’s trouble afoot!

Yeah, I think I heard it from that side! We have to hurry, quick!

S-Stop! Don’t come any closer, pervert~!

I’m not a pervert, I’m your stepmother.
Fufufu! It may have arrived late, but Cinderella had her own rebellious stage, after all~ How wonderful! Tonight we’ll be having red bean rice to celebrate…☆

I told you not to come any closer—!! It’s grooooooss~!!

It’s human nature to chase after anything that runs away! Ahahahahaha!! ☆

You’re making no sense! That’s only you, isn’t it!?
…Hm? Tetora?

Oh, what… It’s just you, Tomoya-kun.

W-Why are you so disappointed!? Oh c’mon~ That’s kinda rude, don’t you think?

Ah, yeah… Sorry.
Huh? You’re in a girl’s outfit?

Yeah, we have our club’s play soon. What about you? What’re you doing here?

We’re patrolling around the area. We heard a scream and rushed over, but it’s just the usual thing with you, so there doesn’t seem to be any problems.

No, no! There’s plenty of problems here, y’know!?

It’s almost time for the Drama Club’s play, huh… Ah, Kiryu was going to be in it too, wasn’t he? Nagumo, I’m sure you want to go see him, so you’re free to do so.

I badly wanna, but Taishou told me to prioritize my work, so~ I’m gonna hold it in!
Guuh~! I would’ve loved to see his awesome figure at least once, though!

Oh, then I could ask him for a picture while we’re in the dressing room.

Really!? You’re such a nice guy, Tomoya-kun~♪

Don’t sweat it, we’re friends.
…Alright, it’s about time I go. See ya, Tetora. Good luck on your side~♪

Back at ya! I can’t watch the play, but I’m cheering for you!

Chapter 8

    Location: Running Grounds (Food Truck)


Heeey, Midori-kun! Shinkai-senpai!
Woah— What’s with this queue!? It’s only this area that’s crowded — What’s going on!?

I’m not sure, but it’s going to be hard for only the two of them to deal with this many customers. We have to go and help them!
Excuse me! Please, let us pass through!
Thank you very much…☆ Are you alright, Takamine? You look exhausted. Go and take a rest on that chair!

M-Morisawa-senpai…? And Nagumo-kun came back, too…
Y-You saved me… I almost lost all hope in this world and was ready to die…

I’m glad we made it in time, then! But I don’t see Shinkai-senpai anywhere… Where’d he go?

That’s what I wanna know… He disappeared before I knew it, so I’ve been tending the truck all by myself… I feel like I’m dying inside…
I worked this hard, so there’s no problem with me heading straight to my death, right…? ♪

You can’t give up now! If you’re a man, then you gotta show all your guts and pump yourself back up!

i am back~♪

Kanata! Just where were you?

mm~ i was [rehydrating] myself. i am now [full] of energy~♪
…oh? midori, you look exhausted. it is all because i left you alone with the [truck]… i am very sorry.

Oh jeez, I told you to avoid going off on your own…
Well, you seem to have learned your lesson now, so I won’t say anything else. Just be careful next time!

Taichou-dono! Shinkai-dono has fulfilled his heroic task wonderfully!
Transfer student-dono and I saw it ourselves! Ahh, but she had something to do, so she is not here right now.
He magnificently dropped a chop on someone who was trying to play around with her~ Heh! ♪

That so!? I see, he’s also growing to become a member of Ryuseitai, one step at a time! Hahaha!! ☆
Right! Now that Kanata and Sengoku are here, everybody listen up while we&#39;re serving our customers!
Nagumo, Sengoku, and I will tend the truck, so Kanata and Takamine should head out and patrol.
And so! You two go now! Leave this place to us!

midori~ will you be okay? i will work hard in [patrol work] to make up for the time i left you alone.

Um, no… Who knows what’ll happen if I leave that to you…
Let’s go change for now… Not that I really wanna, since it’d just make me stand out…

Ah, wait! Do you know everything that you’re supposed to do from here on?
We won’t have enough time to discuss anything about our hero show, so this is the perfect chance to ask me anything you’re not sure of.
Good luck on your skit, you three! Sengoku and I will be watching over you together!
That’s all from me. Right then, it’s time to fulfill our duties…☆

Chapter 9

    Location: Running Grounds


(Sigh… I’m finally done with tending the truck, but now I’ve gotta deal with all this hero show and skit stuff… Ughhh, this is soooo depressiiiing…)
…Hm?
(W-What!? Shinkai-senpai’s gone again…!)
(Whaaa… Morisawa-senpai just told him off, why’s he still doing this…!?)
(H-He shouldn’t be that far… hopefully!)
(Ahh man, why do I have to deal with all of this…!)


    Location: Running Grounds (Food Truck)


Welcome! What would you like?
Okay, one cotton candy! Please wait one moment…☆

Taichou-dono is handling this wonderfully… Does he have experience in serving customers?

Who knows~ Oh, did you prepare the juices for our customer, by the way?

Ah— Yes. Melon juice and grapefruit juice, correct?

Yup! Here you go, enjoy your drinks~♪
Ah! Welcome! Two cotton candy, pineapple juice and orange juice for you, right?
We have a new order. Sengoku-kun, please prepare the cotton candy!

Understood! Heheh, I can prepare the food, while you handle serving the customers. I am truly thankful that you’re being considerate towards me, since I’m shy with strangers.

It wasn’t intentional, though… I’m bad at handling stuff, so~ I’m sure I’d just disappoint the customers with badly-made cotton candy.

No, no! It’s my first time making cotton candy as well! How about you try making one yourself, Tetora-kun?
You may just make one even better than I do!

…You’re right. I shouldn’t give up before I even try! That’s not manly!
Nagumo Tetora will take on this challenge!
Uhhh, so I rotate the stick…?
Ahh—! Some got on my hand! Ack— It’s all sticky now~!

Tetora-kun, you have enough cotton candy near the bottom, so you should add more on the top!

T-The top? L-Like this…?

Well done! I had only realized this after I messed up once, but you can wrap the cotton candy around the top side of the stick if you aim it downwards.
When there’s too much cotton candy on the bottom, you aim the stick downwards, and then vice versa. Making cotton candy is essentially repeating these two steps.
You just have to repeat this until there is no more cotton candy, and it will finally be complete! Mhm! This is a pretty cotton candy~♪

R-Really…? I guess even I can make something~ Heheh! ♪

You guys look like you’re having fun! Mhm mhm, it’s beautiful to see you two getting along so wonderfully…☆

Taichou-dono! Look, look! It is the very first cotton candy Tetora-kun made~♪

Ooh, it’s perfect! Great job, Nagumo!

Oh—! The customers are starting to wonder what is taking us so long. I shall prepare the juice at once!

Heheh, an adorable customer is here. Where are your mommy and daddy?
Ohh, the lady waving her hand is your mommy, and the one beside her is your daddy? I see, I see! You told them to wait there, since you can make an order all by yourself?
So this is your very first time doing an errand! That’s wonderful! I’m so impressed!
Okay, so cotton candy and apple juice is enough? Right then, give me a moment.
Hmhmhm~♪


I’ll give you the cotton candy first. It’s sweet and tasty? Oh! You have a bit on your cheek. Be careful while you eat it, okay?
Mhm, mhm~ You’re a good kid…♪ Can you hold the apple juice? Mhm, carry it carefully so it doesn’t spill. Bye byee~ Let’s meet again! ☆

Kids really like you, don’t they? They’re always swarming around you during a hero show.

Yeah, I love kids! I was this close to hugging the kid just now, but I held it in!

Uh, yeah, it’s a good thing you did.
Right, Taichou. It’s &#39;bout time for the skit, so can I leave the rest to you two?

Yeah, there aren’t as many customers now, so we’ll be fine.
Nagumo, I know you didn’t ask for my help, but… Just because you’re acting out a delinquent role, doesn’t mean you have to try and become one.
Just be yourself. That would make me feel more at ease.

……?

Ahaha, you don’t seem like you understand what I’m trying to say. Well, for now, just do it the way you want to.

Gotcha! Right then, Taichou, Sengoku-kun! I’ll see you later!

Chapter 10

    Location: Running Grounds


excuse meee~ i would like some [fish], please~♪
huh? you do not have [fish]?
then i would like [something] that is like [fish]…♪
ohh, there is a [food stall] selling [taiyaki] over there, i see~ [tai] are tasty, so i like it.
thank you for the [information]~

Uuuu~…?

oh no, i bumped into you… i am sorry, are you [okay]?

Sora’s fine! Sora was just not paying attention!
Huh? Sea Onii~san?
HaHa~♪ Hello! Sora greets his seniors when he meets them~♪

hello~♪ did you not come with nacchan today?

Sora was with Shisho only a second ago, but then he got separated from him~
It was wrong of Sora to not pay attention!
Sora was feeling ill from the crowd, so when he tried to go somewhere without as much color, he got lost.

i see~ there is no need to worry, yellow kid. i will take you to where nacchan is at~
it is part of my [patrolling] job to [protect] lost [children], and find their [parents].

HiHi~♪ Thank you! Sora shows his gratitude to anyone who is kind to him~♪

…………

Wawa—? Sora hears a growling sound~ This is… the color of an empty stomach!

oh, you figured me out~…

HuHu~? Sea Onii~san, are you hungry? Sora learned from Senpai that people can’t fight when they’re hungry!
What would you like? Sora will buy it for you if you tell him~

ufufu, thank you. you are [kind], just like nacchan~
do not worry, i was thinking of buying [taiyaki] just now~ excuse meee, i would like two [taiyaki]~♪
huh? there is [red bean] paste flavor and [cream] flavor? hm~ i think i will take one [red bean] paste.
which one do you think is good for the other taiyaki?

HeHe~? Sora is the one who has to decide?

yes~ i am going to give you one as a [present], so please choose a flavor~♪

HoHo~♪ Thank you! Sora shows his gratitude to anyone who treats him nicely! Okay, Sora will take the cream one!
Let’s have half of each! Getting to taste both flavors will make Sora so happy~♪

fufu, that is a great idea~♪
ow, hot— it is [fresh] from the oven, so i have to [cool] it down before eating it, don’t i… i will [burn] otherwise.

Are you bad with hot food, Sea Onii~san?

yes, i am~ it is a shame i cannot eat immediately, even though i am [starving].

Ah— Sea Onii~san! There’s a colorful and pretty dolphin!

uwaah, it is [candy] in the shape of a [dolphin]~ this will not be hot, so i can eat it straight away~♪
excuse meee~ i would like two of this [dolphin candy]~♪
here you go, yellow kid. it would not be [right] if i eat one by myself.
it will make us both much [happier] to [share] delicious food and fun things with each other~♪

Sora agrees! Sora got separated from Shisho and Senpai, but Sora is happy to have met with Sea Oniisan♪

(lick, lick)…♪ mm~ it gave me a [tingly] feeling.

Really? Sora’s tastes sour~ Maybe it’s lemon flavor?

hmm… the [yellow] area must be [lemon] flavor, huh~ the [blue] area is probably [soda] flavor?
ufufu, we get to enjoy all kinds of [flavors], then~ i am glad we bought this.
the [taiyaki] should have cooled down by now, too. this [fish] is enough for me.
i am much more [happy] like this~♪

Chapter 11

Excuse me, I need to get through! Please move aside!
(Ugh, it’s so crowded…)
(I’ll just get pushed back if I force myself through the crowd, but some people won’t move aside even when I ask them to… This is tough…)
(Oh yeah, the Drama Club’s performance must have ended by now.)
(I heard some people talking &#39;bout how cool the Second Prince was. Just what I’d expect from Taishou! I bet he performed his prince role superbly…!)
(I gotta work hard too! I gotta perform my delinquent role perfectly, so he’ll praise me for a great job!)
(Ah, well, it’s not that I took this role to be praised…)
(It’s just— I wanna go down the same path Taishou took, I guess. I feel like I could get one step closer to being a man among men if I do this…!)

puka, puka…♪

(Hm? That’s Shinkai-senpai over there, right? He must be in the middle of patrol work. I should go thank him for his hard work.)


Shinkai-senpai!

ah— tetora. hello~ would you like some [candy], too?

You’re eating while patrolling…? You’re way too free, Shinkai-senpai~

HaHa~♪ Hello! Sora greets anyone he knows! ♪

Oh, Harukawa-kun! ‘Sup~☆
Uhh… Kinda weird to see you two together. What happened?

You see~ Sora got separated from Shisho and Senpai. He was lost, so Sea Onii~san has been taking care of him~

Ohh, I see! Great work, Shinkai-senpai…☆

you too, [tetora]. are you hungry? you can have some [taiyaki] if you like~♪

Huh— Is that okay with you?

of course it is~ we will all become even [happier] if we [share] tasty food with you.

T-Then I’ll have some! (munch, much)…♪

ufufu. you look very [happy]~
the bigger the happiness [circle] becomes, the closer we get to the [whole world] being filled with [happiness].

Ahaha, that’s just how a hero would think! Please show that same kinda heroic feel in the skit we’re having later!

…? later? are we doing something?

Umm, you’re jokin’, right?
We’re planning to do a skit where I’m a delinquent who chats up with the transfer student, and then you and Midori-kun will come over and save her, remember?

ahh~… that’s right. midori and i are the heroes, yes?
that kind of feels [strange]. when i think of “hero”, i think of chiaki.

I can’t deny that. Also, I’ve been wondering for a while now, but… Where’s Midori-kun?

Hey— Move, move! Ah— Kanata-kun! Perfect timing!

kaoru~? why do you look so flustered?

Well, see… There’s some delinquent guys who managed to get into our school somehow…
They came over to our cafe, too. They were bothering the girls, so we asked them to leave.
But I heard something similar happened someplace else, too…
I’ve been trying to find someone from the student council so I could report the issue. You’re patrolling, right? Can you contact any of the members?

why yes, i can~ with this [walkie-talkie], i can—
hm? ah, that’s right, i left that with midori, didn’t i…

I also had mine with me, but I left it behind when I was done with my patrol work~!

Are you serious… so I really do have to go all the way and report this by myself? Ahh, I didn’t sign up for all this running and sweat~!

kaoru ran off. still, it sounds like [something] troublesome is brewing, doesn’t it~?

Uumyu… I have a bad feeling &#39;bout this. I hope nothing bad happens…
For now, let’s rush over to where we promised to meet Midori-kun and the transfer student!

Center of the World 1

    Season: Spring (Before graduation season)


    Location: Studio


Ossu, hello! I’m Nagumo Tetora from Ryuseitai! I’m enterin’ the studio if you don’t mind~! ☆

Ughhh, what’s with the ruckus… Is this an ambush?

Woah—! You startled me!
I was just ‘bout to ask if anybody’s in here, but then I spotted you from underneath the kotatsu, Sakuma-senpai~♪ You still haven’t gotten rid of it?

It’s not Sakuma-senpai, it’s Ritsu­-senpai. You have to get it down right.
I still feel a little cold… Like I’ll really start feeling lonely if I put this round table away… It’ll make me realize how we’re going to say our goodbyes to each other soon enough.
Anyway, you got something to do with Knights? Sorry to say, but I’m the only one here today.

Mm~… I guess I came at the wrong time. Does Knights have the day off?

Well, everyone had their own business to tend to, soo…
We had a quick meeting, practiced a bit, and then stopped for the day.
We’re an individualistic type of unit, so we’ve got days when that’s all we end up doing. …Although, we’ve been having more days when we’re all together.

Ohhh, that’s real enlightening. We’re the complete opposite from you guys. We always try our best to group up.
We’re all ‘bout “All for one, one for all.”
“The five of us together are Ryuseitai” is how we roll, after all.

Huh. Then I guess we’re something like, “Even alone, we’re still Knights.”
…But seriously, what’re you here for? Keeping up this conversation is getting exhausting.

Oh! Sorry for takin’ up your time! Umm… Is Narukami Arashi-senpai around, or…?

Nacchan? They said they wanted to run around aimlessly to let off some stress.
So they’re probably over at their club, yeah?

Ah! Oh yeah, he was in the Track &amp; Field Club, wasn’t he? I didn’t check the running grounds…
I came straight over here once my practice session was done.
Thanks for the hint, Saku— Ritsu-senpai. I’ll go check out his club.

Right… Ah, I could text them that you’re coming over to see them first.
Although… I guess they’re still running right about now, so they probably left their phone in their bag.

Ossu! That’d help me out, thank you!
Heheh! I thought you were the type to be blunt with things, but you’re actually really nice~♪

It all depends on the time and place… I’m feeling lonely today, that’s all.
But I’ve got a question for you, uh… Tekko-kun, was it? You good friends with Nacchan, or something?

I’m not Tekko, I’m “Tetora”!
Nah, I’m not. I’m not so good with how he talks… I haven’t ever really talked to him outside of work-related stuff!

Ahh… Yeah, it’s typical to be confused by how they talk when you aren’t used to it…
…Oh, Nacchan immediately replied back to me after I sent them a message. Looks like they’ve taken a break just now.

Oooh, then I should be able to meet him if I just go over to where he is, right? I’ll go rushing to the running grounds straight away!
Righty then, I’ll leave you alone now! Thank you so much for all your help~!

(…And he dashed off. Youngsters sure are energetic…)
(But really, why did he want to see Nacchan… Aren’t those two complete opposites? Like, I don’t think there’s any connection between the two…)
(Ah, wait… Nacchan’s been doing something society keeps expecting from them, I think…)
(If he came over to see Nacchan ‘cause of that rumor… Then he’s probably going to set Nacchan off, huh…)

Sorry, I’m back for a second longer!

Eeek—! Sheesh, you freaked me out… Why’re you back here? Did you forget something?

Ah, no… well, I guess you could say I almost forgot to do something… I brought over a blanket for you, so please use it, Ritsu-senpai~♪

Huh? Why a blanket?

Heheh, you’ve been in that kotatsu for so long that you’ll start freezing as soon as you leave it.
So if you end up sleeping inside of it, you’ll eventually get a cold.
Which is why I got you a blanket. I use this often during Ryuseitai sleepovers.
I know I’m doing somethin’ you didn’t ask for, but I just kept getting more worried.

Mmm… I’m fine, though… I’m healthy as long as I drink blood.

You can’t let your guard down like that~ It looks like everyone’s been getting a cold lately, so I want you to take care of yourself. You need to take care of your health for work~♪
Haha, sorry for talkin’ like a wise guy… Alright, I’ll leave you alone this time~♪

Yeah, bye bye~
Mmgh… This blanket stinks like a guy…
(Mmm… I don’t get that kid at all… He looks like he’s just a bit dumb, though…)
(That’s exactly why people like me, who overthink things way too much, would prefer avoiding people like him…)
(You can’t use logic to read an beast…)[1]
(Although… He did get worried about me, and went all the way to bring a blanket for me, so I doubt he’s all that bad.)
(But depending on the situation — a good kid, a reasonable argument, or even a white lie can sometimes hurt someone’s feelings.)
(It feels like something bad’s gonna happen… I’m seriously starting to get worried.)

Center of the World 2

    Location: Running Grounds


…………

Heeeeey, Arashi-saaaaaan! I see you showed up for the club todaaay! It’s Mamaaaaaaa! ☆

…There’s really no need to yell. I can tell it’s you from a hundred kilometers away, Mama. You do realize you’re incredibly huge, right?


Hahaha! You’re unusually in a bad mood, huuuh?

Mm~… If you of all people noticed with one glance, even when you’re so thick headed… then this is a much more serious case of depression than I thought.
Gosh, I’d really rather not be seen in an awful mood…
But the thing is… Graduation season and Repayment Festival is in just a few weeks, right?
So I suppose even I’ve been feeling gloomy about everything?

That isn’t the only reason, is it?
I heard about that job you took… Buuut everyone loved it, so what about it upsets you?
Well, I guess it’d be a little too dense of me if I seriously asked you that…
I know I’m waaay too late in saying this, buuut I don’t think you should’ve taken that job in the first place, y’know?
It was a photo album that emphasizes your cool, manly side, right?
The sales were off the charts with all sooorts of good reviews, weren’t they? Even my shut-in[2] little sister knew about it.

Hm? You have a sister, Mama?

My unfortunate sister… She’s the complete opposite of me, and I don’t really understand her. Plus, she’s mentally fragile and never leaves her room…

Ahaha, that really is the complete opposite of you, who’s always traveling all over the world~

Yeaaah, we’re complete strangers to each other’s worlds… But aaanyway, enough about my life; we’re talking about you right now, Arashi-san.
A job that emphasizes your manliness… Isn’t that the sorta thing you’d haaate to do?

Mm… I mean, I should be super happy, since my beauty was appreciated by everyone…
And the positive reviews are bound to be a blessing, especially if I plan to continue working as part of Knights…
Even Izumi-chan praised me for it. For once, he genuinely told me I did a good job.
I shouldn’t be upset at all. I should be twirling around in excitement. That’s how I roll… That’s how Narukami Arashi would react.
At this point, I wouldn’t feel hurt at all by people’s words, whether it’s telling me I’m manly or cool… Or hurtful things, like “creepy” or “shitty okama”[3]…
No matter what anyone says, I love myself most.
That’s how it should be, but… I can’t help but feel so discontent.

Mmm~ Yeah, this really is a serious case, huuuh…
There’s only one thing I can say here: If you need my help, I’ll do whatever it takes for you.
If you wanna continue pursuing manliness and get more praise, theeen I can help you out.
I myself tend to get good reviews for that sorta thing, sooo I could share my advice with you on how to expand your horizons.
But if you can’t stand to be in a position where all people want from you is manliness, then I’ll destroy anything and everything that forces you to do that.
You’ve got two options! I’m terrible at taking precautions, sooo it’s gonna be all or nothing from me! Alrighty then, what’s it gonna be!?

When you get involved, everything is taken care of in a flash without me even getting involved, and I don’t like that…
So as always, I choose neither.
I’ll find a middle ground for myself. …Besides, Mama, aren’t you busy now that we’re reaching graduation? Do you even have the time to take care of others right now?

Hahaha! I’m in a solo unit, so I’ve got nooothing to do with all those generation change problems. I’m taking it pretty easy lately~♪

Huh… I suppose you have countless options to choose from for your future career, too.  …Hm?

Heyaa~! Nice to meet you, Narukami-senpai! I’m Nagumo Tetora from Ryuseitai! ☆

Mhm. Ritsu-chan sent me a message, so I knew you’d be coming. …But why did you want to see me?

Ossu! The truth is, I wanna learn the secrets to manliness from you, Narukami-senpai!

…I thought so. It’s basically a catchphrase at this point for you to mention how your dream is to be a “man among men”, isn’t it?

Huh…? Erm, how come you know so much about me?

Ufufu, I love hard-working boys, after all.
And you’re the epitome of one… So I’ve had my eyes on you, Tetora-chan. ♪

I-I’m not a fan of being called by “-chan”, to be honest…

Oh my, how rude of me. It’s not manly after all, is it? …Hmm~ What shall we do here, hm?
I don’t have any plans for today, so I could spend time with you, but…
Are you sure you want it from me? I think there are people much more suitable for this out there…?
I assume you saw my photo album, but… This is how I usually am, you know? I’m not quite sure if I can teach you the secrets to manliness.

Ossu! I totally saw your photo album. You looked super duper awesome!
I admire the way you were like, oozing manliness…!
That’s the sorta manly guy I wanna be! So please, teach me your ways!

………
……Alright, fine. If you really want it that badly, I’ll teach you. I always make sure to pamper any junior that comes my way.
Let’s see now… Okay then, let’s start with step one, Tetora-chan.
“In order to grasp manliness, one must learn the ways of a woman”…♪

Come in, Tetora-chan. Welcome to a whole new world~♪

Um, like I said before, I’d really like it if you didn’t call me by “-chan”.
I know I’m being picky, but it makes me feel like you’re treating me like a little kid, so I don’t really like it.

Ah, so that’s what you don’t like about it.
My bad… But to me, all the first years in school are still adooorable little children.
Don’t worry about it too much. Kids are called cute no matter their gender.
See, I’ve been modeling since I was young, and was pushed around by the harshness of society, so I had no choice but to grow up and be more like an adult…
Looking back, it makes me wish I enjoyed my youth just a little bit more…

Huh, so that’s how it is… Personally, I’m envious of how mature my seniors are.
I wonder what sets us apart from each other… We’re not even that far apart in age.

Hm… Isn’t it because we’ve got the “senior” label on us?
Being an adult has nothing to do with age, Tetora-cha— Tetora-kun~♪
People change to suit their current situation, so labels make it easier for them to become that very thing.
How about you try labeling yourself as “man among men”? It may feel a little awkward at first, but you’ll become one before you know it.

A label, huh…
Maybe I could earn that title if I win in the Dragon King Competition? It’s the manliest DreamFes in school.

Oh no, no. It’s much easier than that.
Just ask Anzu-chan or someone like her to do it for you. The next time you get featured in a magazine, make them mention that you’re a “man among men.”

Uu~myu… But that just feels like I’m cheating…
Like, I’d be tricking everyone into thinking I’m a man among men… I’m sure Taishou would only say that I’m letting the label define me.

Ufufu, it’s fine if it’s like that at the start. You’ll slowly fit the label perfectly in time.

Ooh… I’m learnin’ a lot.
You said you’ve been modeling since you were young, right? I feel like that’s what makes you seem so experienced, Narukami-senpai.

Fufu, it’s nothing to be proud of in front of a crowd… I don’t have any wise things to say, since I’ve still got a lot to learn by myself.
But you’ve asked me to teach you the secrets to being manly, so I’m going to do it. I always do my job properly.
Not that I’m really interested in this, honestly… I mean, wouldn’t you get your answer faster if you asked your Mr. “Taishou,” or your seniors from Ryuseitai about this?

Mmm… We’re reaching graduation soon, so I don’t really wanna bother my third-year seniors.
Ah! That doesn’t mean I thought it’s okay to bother you instead, though!

Ahaha, nobody said that, you know~? You’re pretty cautious with these things, despite how you seem.

Mmm… I’m more girly and delicate[4] than I seem, y’see…

That’s okay, being aware of it means you can work on it.
And so, just go with the flow and follow my word. ♪
First things first: Make yourself look as pretty and adorable as possible with anything in this shop.
I’ll give you some pointers, but you should mainly choose with your own taste.

Huh…? Uhh… I’m sorry, but I don’t really get it! How’s this gonna help me…? I’m tryna be more manly…
I won’t get anything from being cute… I’m aiming for the opposite direction, y’know?

Now, now! Don’t think, just act! That’s much more manly~♪

Uu~… Alright, I’ll put my trust in you and do as you say.

Mhm, good luck~ You’ve got thirty minutes, okay? I’ll be buying stuff in the meantime~♪
Oh my! They’re already having a spring sale! Kyaa~! I hope I have the money!

(…Mmm~ I feel like I’m on a date with an older lady… It’s makin’ me a little restless.)
(Oh, right. I only have thirty minutes, so I’d better get moving fast.)
(But… I don’t really know what I’m supposed to look for to be cute…?)
(I guess makeup…? Since I doubt the clothes here fit my size…)
(Ah! Maybe if I wear these animal ears…?)
(Uu~myu, I look stupid! It just looks like I’m tryna do some kinda act!)
(Gahh! I didn’t expect things to go like this at all…!! I really dunno what to do!!)
(I mean… when he said that I gotta “learn the ways of a woman,” my heart started racing with all kinds’a images…)
(So this was completely unexpected… But I’m glad it wasn’t like that.)
(E-Everything’ll go okay, right…? I’m trusting you, Narukami-senpai! I want you to make me into a man among men!)

(Ahaha, he’s really struggling~)
(You’re so earnest, Tetora-kun… It’s suuuper cute~♪)
(But now I feel bad… It feels like I’m tricking a pure, innocent boy.)
(His words actually really set me off earlier, so I just said whatever on the spot.)
(I thought maybe I could make him carry my shopping bags for me…)
(But he’s much more serious about this than I thought. I can tell just by looking at his expression… Just why is he working so hard for this?)
(Is there even a need for manliness in this current age…?)

(Humming) Hmhmhm~…♪
…Mm? My my, who’s the naughty kid poking my shoulder~?
Ah, it really was you! Hi~ Anzu-chan! As always, you’re much quicker to move than talk, aren’t you? You shouldn’t make physical contact with me, okay?
But I’ll let it slide, since it’s you… Ufufu, we come across each other in this shop often, don’t we?
We’re both regulars here, aren’t we~? It’s got the best items in the neighborhood, after all. ♪
Are you here to shop, too? Of course you are, since you’re such a cute girl!
Let’s look at the spring selection together, shall we? I wonder what’s trending this year…?
Look, don’t you think this would suit you? Or maybe it’s too childish…?
Gosh, there I go again… I can’t help but see you as my little sister, even though we’re the same age!
Fufu, you’re going to be the only senior in the producer course in the next term, so~
Maybe it’s best that you go for a more mature look, so that they don’t underestimate you?
How about wearing stylish glasses? It’ll make you look super mature. ♪
There’s been a lot of cute glasses lately~ My vision has always been perfect, so I never noticed the selection.
Mhm, I have 20/20 vision. Adonis-chan even told me that having such great eyesight and being a fast runner would make me an excellent hunter.
…Was that him complimenting me…? Then again, he’s never the type to say anything rude.
Mm? Gosh, Anzu-chan… don’t tug on me, okay?
What’s wrong, is there something you’d like to tell me?
…Ahh! I completely forgot about Tetora-kun! I got so caught up in browsing the shop…!
How terrible of me… Hasn’t an hour passed by now?
Hm, hm… He was worried about me?
You so happened to spot him, and after you heard him out, you went looking for me in the store…?
I’m so sorry! I got really into the conversations I had with the manager~
She even showed me the storage room full of all the new upcoming stuff!
Do you know where Tetora-kun is right now? Eh? In the dressing room?
Did he get too embarrassed to go out wearing a cute outfit?
(Oh my gosh, he seriously did what I told him to do…?)
(I thought he was just going through some random teenage dilemma…)
(Unlike me, who’s mentally and emotionally suffering from gender-related problems—)
(I thought he was just babbling about becoming manly for some silly, childish reason.)
(And if I told him whatever random thing that came to mind, he’d feel ridiculed and stomp back home in frustration… since I figured his worry is nothing serious.)
(After all, our worries are fundamentally different in every way… Yet he still went ahead and hit a sensitive nerve.)
(That’s why I got upset, and did something cruel to him in retaliation.)
(But you’re telling me he actually believed in me through and through…?)
(…Ugh! Just who is the childish one here, huh!? I’m such an idiot!)
Oh gosh, I’m so sorry, Anzu-chan…… Could you show me where Tetora-kun is?
Ah, that dressing room over there?
Tetora-kuuun! I’m so sorry for forgetting all about you and leaving you on your own! I want to make it up to you! If you forgive me, I’ll guide you much more seriously this time, so—

Ah! Narukami-senpai…?

Yes, it’s me. Umm, I can’t see you, but… How’s it going? May I open the curtains?

O-Ossu! ‘S all good! Come on in!

Y-You sound a bit overwhelmed…? Umm, then I’m going to check, okay…?


Ossu! This is the absolute best I could do, Narukami-senpai!

………

I-I didn’t pass, did I?
I couldn’t figure out the best choice by myself, so when I spotted Anzu-Anego by chance, I asked for her advice!

…Is that true, Anzu-chan?

Ossu! She got really into it midway and turned me into her dress-up doll!
This can be said about fans too, but… Girls can be a little scary sometimes!

Ahaha, in the world of beasts and insects, the female is more likely to be the cruel predator… Maybe human beings are the same, too?
Anyway, mhm… You look a lot better than I thought you would.
You passed just fine. Even if Anzu-chan helped you, cross-dressing guys don’t always look so put-together.
Fufu, I was going to make you wear an embarrassing outfit, and have you carry my shopping bags around the street…
I wanted to hurt you, you know? Because I felt hurt by your words.
But an eye for an eye just isn’t beautiful at all… I was such an idiot — There’s no hope for me if I turn ugly on the inside.
I take it all back. I’m so sorry, Tetora-kun, you can change back into your clothes, okay?

O-Ossu! Next is walkin’ around the street in these clothes, right!?

…Mm?

Gotcha! Nagumo Tetora’s gonna do his absolute best! I’ll put every effort into it! The black flame is the mark of effort…!

Huh? Huh…!?

I’m off! Sorry, but I’ll have to give you my wallet, so please pay for me!
Oooohh~! I only mess up when I overthink stuff, so the best thing to do here is to charge through without a second thought~!
Go for it, me! Become a man among men…!

Wh— Hold on, Tetora-kun! Listen to what I have to say first…!

Huff, huff… Tetora-kuuun!! Where did you go!?
(…Shoot! I completely lost sight of him!)
(How’d he outrun me — I’m from the Track &amp; Field Club! I only took a few minutes at the cashier!)
(Ahh, why did this have to happen…?)
(He relied on me… He believed in me, and politely asked for my help…)
(But all I did was lash out at him for asking me how to be “manly”.)
(He didn&#39;t even do anything wrong… He was just trying to get closer to his ideal image…)
(…Now I&#39;m just acting like an evil queen from some fairy tale…)
(I’m exactly like everyone who’s hurt me. All I was doing was turning him into a toy for laughs, making fun of him, then leaving him to rot, just like them—)

Heeey!! Arashi-saaaaaan!!

…!? Mama!

Yep, that&#39;s meee! And your friend&#39;s here, too! ♪

Friend…?

Yo, Nacchaaan~…♪

Ritsu-chan! My, were you two close? I never thought I&#39;d see you two together.

Not really, but Mikejimaman is my brother’s successor, or something… He&#39;s like his pupil, so sometimes he comes over to our turf at home.
We kinda know each other through that, and I talk to him if I ever see him. I went to check up on you ‘cause I got worried, and found Mikejimaman doing the same.
So we decided to check if you’re doing okay together… Except it&#39;s super tiring to walk, so I made him carry me.
We got here real quick, and it was a steady ride on top of him. You deserve some praise for being such an excellent horse~♪

Hahaha, this is just light work! O Knight, I’m so honored by your praise!
…Although, the “man” in “Mikejimaman” makes me sound waaay too much like a hero…

Ermm… Well, see, a lot’s happened, and now I don&#39;t know where Tetora-kun&#39;s gone.
If it&#39;s alright with you two, could you help me find him?
He was really embarrassed in the dressing room, that he couldn’t get himself to leave… But then he misunderstood something I said to him, so now he’s running around town.
He’s going to get even more embarrassed once he snaps out of it — or worse, it&#39;ll traumatize him… He may severely get hurt from this, even though he&#39;s such an honest, good kid.

Mm… It&#39;ll be okay, just take a deep breath. This isn&#39;t like you, y’know?

Yeah, I know it’s tough to do this, but you have to calm down first. Making a hasty decision could result in an even greater disaster.

Mhm. Calm yourself down, analyze the situation, and deal with it accordingly.
First, that Nagumo kid should have a phone, right? Did you try calling him?
I mean, he&#39;s not an animal. It&#39;s not like you have to try and chase after him.

Ah… Yes, I did think of doing that at first, but—
His phone was in the wallet he gave me to pay for his clothes…

Why would you put a phone in a wallet…
He seems like the careless type, so he must prefer to put everything important in one place… I bet if he didn&#39;t, he’d probably lose one of them whenever he’s outside.

Hm, so he&#39;s not carrying a phone right now.
This makes finding him a biiit harder… Doesn&#39;t mean there isn&#39;t a way around this, though.
Let&#39;s split up and look for him in the area.
I&#39;ll go through each place he could&#39;ve gone to, and send you any info I get from people who&#39;ve seen him.

Mikejimaman, can&#39;t you get a police dog on the job? We&#39;d find him easily through scent… I mean, he smells a pretty specific way, doesn&#39;t he?

Hm… I don’t really like to rely on my dad, but I’ll ask him to bring one over.

Um, don&#39;t make a fuss over this, okay…?
It&#39;s not like an actual crime happened… If we make a big deal out of this, he might feel even more ashamed of himself.

Yeah, I’m aware. We’re doing this to keep ourselves at ease — It’s not something for the police to deal with.
Still… This is a reaaally serious problem. We can’t just leave it alone.
We&#39;ll solve this ASAP, together! With rapid speed!

Yes! Thank you, it sure is wonderful to have reliable seniors and friends. ♪

Ahaha, no need for thanks. This is me repaying you for always taking care of me. You shouldn&#39;t have any reservations around a vampire anyway. We aren&#39;t good with running water[5]…

Yep! Also, it&#39;s Mama&#39;s duty to help his adooorable daughter…☆

Ahaha… Wow, you&#39;re so reliable, I could almost cry…♪

Center of the World 6
Anzu-chaaan!
So, did Tetora-kun come back?
I had you wait at the store in case he gets embarrassed and rushes back…
…I see, so he hasn’t. He seems the type to charge through without ever looking back whenever he starts to overthink things.
That’s a wonderful trait to have, but it’s just a burden on us right now.
I can’t figure out his next move… I doubt he’s even acting on logic. He’s like an animal, just as his name states.[6]
…Mhm, you stay here and act as a communication point for everyone looking for him.
You take the lead and tell us what’s best to do here, like our control tower.
After all, you’ve proven to be proficient at that role for a long time now… “Producer”-chan. And we won’t be as efficient if we work without proper coordination.
I’ll keep looking around the place. I already checked the main street, so another area he could be in is… the alleyway, maybe?
Usually, I’d never get near these places because they’re so dirty, damp, and moldy… but I have to make sacrifices here.
I’ll just quickly take a look around those areas.
Hm? “Be careful, Onee-chan”?
Good point. It’s pretty safe around here, but alleyways are a different story… there might be some delinquents.
But don’t you worry! I can protect myself just fine. I’m my very own biggest treasure, I would do anything to protect my life.
Don’t worry about me, okay? Just message me if Tetora-kun comes back, or if the others have more information on the situation.
Okay, I’ll see you soon, Anzu-chan. I know you were just enjoying your time shopping around, so I’m really sorry to have involved you in this mess.
(Right then… I tried to sound composed when talking to Anzu-chan, but alleyways really are scary…)
(Maybe I should bring Mama along instead of going in alone, since he’s a strong fighter.)
(……Hm? H-Huh? I think there’s some people arguing in the alleyway…?)
(Gosh, I can’t see a thing in this dark place!)
(…Wha!? Are those awful-looking guys crowding around a girl…!? Oh no—!)
(Wait, is that… Tetora-kun?)
(Yeah, actually, I recognize that outfit! Those are the new clothes from that shop!)
(Did they corner him because they got grossed out by a guy wearing a dress…?)
(Are they making fun of him? Bullying him and pushing him around…?)
(…! No, I can’t let that happen! Tetora-kun doesn’t deserve to be picked on!)
(Because all of this is my fault…!)
(I’m the one who tried to turn him into a toy just to relieve my stress! I’m the one who stepped on his pure-hearted feelings!)


Hey, you…!!
Get away from that girl right this instant! Don’t you dare touch her with your filthy hands!
(…………)
(…Alright! I scared them away.)
(I’m so glad my breathing exercises came in handy! Anyone would flinch if they heard a shout that ear-piercingly loud!)
(I’m relieved that I didn’t need to get into a fistfight with them, too… I wouldn’t have been able to, anyway — committing violence is fatal to an idol’s career.)
(I’d much rather settle things through vicious threats. That’s why animals usually growl at each other, after all.)
(But still, I should learn to do better… Shouting is just another form of violence, so I fail as an idol either way. Gosh, I still have so much to learn, don’t I?)
(You’d think I’d be more experienced by now if I felt comfortable enough to act like a grown-up — like a distinguished senior should be…)
(…Oh! Never mind me, I need to check on Tetora-kun—)
Tetora-kun! Are you alright? They didn’t hurt you, did they?
(Wait, huh? Now that those delinquents are gone, I can see better, but… This isn’t Tetora-kun, is it?)
(It was genuinely a girl all along… Huh…? So it was all a coincidence that she was wearing the same trendy clothes as him?)
Woah! Don’t cling to me…
You must’ve been so scared… There, there. ♪
Don’t worry, you’re safe. The scary people are gone now.
My acquaintance knows someone from the police department, so we’ll have his help in keeping you safe.
Don’t cry… Everything’s all okay now, I promise. There’s no need to worry. ♪

Narukami-senpai!

Eeek!? Huh? Tetora-kun!?

Ossu! Are you alright, Narukami-senpai!? I’m here to help!
Anzu-Anego told me that you were arguing with some delinquents in an alleyway…!

U-Umm, yes… But everything’s okay. I drove them all away, as you can see. I rescued the girl they were picking on, too. ♪

Ah, I’m so glad to hear that! A lady shouldn’t be doing something so dangerous, okay?

Huh? Erm, but she ended up getting surrounded by them… They’re the ones at fault, you know?
Anyway, where did you head off to, Tetora-kun? I was so worried about you!

Ossu, I’m so sorry… I just ran all over the place like crazy.
Then before I knew it, I ended up somewhere I didn’t even know, without a clue on how to get back.
That’s when Mikejima-senpai showed up with a dog and picked me up.
He brought me back to the shop Anzu-Anego was waitin’ at.
Mikejima-senpai’s awesome! He had the dog sit on his lap and made me cling to his back, and then rode us back here on his motorbike in a split second!

Um, that sounds like a whole bunch of law violations, but…
Mama’s as quick as ever. He really is the perfect person for emergencies — He managed to find you in a blink of an eye.

Yup… He came to my rescue in such a heroic fashion.
I expect nothing less from the person Taichou respects~ I’m still nowhere near my seniors’ level.

Center of the World 7
Um, so where’s Mama right now? He could do something really bad if we don’t keep an eye on him… Just the thought of it scares me.
(Hmm… But it’s him we’re talking about, so he’s probably dealing with the delinquents that ran off…)
(He might be warning them to keep quiet about this…)
(I mean, it’s a good precaution, but… It feels wrong, like we’re trying to cover up a scandal or something… Gosh, nothing good comes from violence.)

Um, Narukami-senpai… Mikejima-senpai told me ‘bout you while we were getting here…
I’m so sorry! I’m such an idiot…! I was so selfish! I never once considered your feelings!

Huh? Um… But I’m the one who’s supposed to say sorry…?

No! Please let me apologize for everything! Please forgive me!

Wh— Don’t kneel on the ground in this dirty alleyway! You’ll get your clothes dirty!

I can just clean them later! But hurting someone emotionally could ruin their whole life…!
I’m so, so sorry! Narukami-senpai, you hated how I called you “manly,” didn’t you…?
Of course you would’ve… You talk like a lady, after all…
Not just that… I may not completely get it, but you’re a woman inside, right…?
So it must’ve been painful for you to know everyone wants to see you be “manly,” right…?
And then I come in and start praising you for being “manly” like an idiot, and asking you shamelessly to teach me how to be one…
I’m so sorry… Please forgive me, Narukami-senpai.

Lift your head up, Tetora-kun.
It’s fine, I forgive you. I was awful to you too, so let’s call it even between us.
If both of us have forgiven each other after enough apologies…
Only then will I teach you the secrets to manliness again.
Step two: Forget all those things the world keeps saying about men, like “A man shouldn’t bow his head down to just anyone, should never show his tears”…
Who cares? That sort of thing is complete crap, even if some wise know-it-all wrote a book about it.
Haha, I just talked really indecently…
The point is, you apologized to me properly, without a care for your clothes… That’s what makes you look incredibly manly and amazing right now.
So Tetora-kun… Lift your head up. It’s true that I was a little hurt, but I’m alright now.

…(sobs)

Oh my, you’re crying really hard. Stay still; I’ll wipe your tears off with a handkerchief.

Uuu, sniff… I’m sorry! But I really just don’t like being treated like a kid!
Ugh, I shouldn’t be talking after everything I’ve done to you…!

Mhm, you’re still just a kid… still just a boy. But that’s why you’ll eventually become a man if you keep working hard and growing.
I’m honestly envious… No matter how much I want it, and no matter how hard I try… I could never become the beautiful woman I dream to be.
But even if that’s true… I won’t let it depress me. I won’t whine about it anymore. I love myself most, no matter who I am.
Anyone who can love themselves like that is charming, no matter their gender… Don’t you think so?

…Yeah. I think so too. I wanna be like you, Narukami-senpai.
I was so impatient… Soon enough, Taishou and Taichou… All our seniors are gonna graduate.
I wanted to become a great man before then… so that they could leave without any worries. But I’m just not gettin’ there. I’m still nowhere near that ideal… Still just stuck running in circles.
I’m so pathetic.

(Ahh… Right, we’re reaching that time of the year…)
(Gosh… I’m seriously such an idiot. He really is just an earnest kid.)
(He never, ever meant to make fun of me.)
(He was just restless, and it made him shortsighted… He just didn’t pay attention to what’s going on, that’s all.)
(Just like how I was, when I thought that girl was him…)
(Tetora-kun… We’ve still got a long way to go, haven’t we?)
(Our seniors are still so worried about us, that they can’t get themselves to leave just yet.)
(That’s why… We should grow up. We don’t have much time, but…)
(Let’s work hard to the very end — until we’re much, much closer to our ideal selves.)
(Let’s stand tall, and see our seniors off with pride.)
(We’ll see them off… as they leave the world for children, and completely become adults.)

You’re in a good mood, huh, Tetora-kun…?

Hm? You think so~? Well, I did have a wonderful encounter the other day~♪

Huh? Did you get a girlfriend or something…?

Oh, no, no! That’s far outta my league… But well, I did get to know a really charming lady!

Whoa, I was only joking… A-Are you for real…? Wow, so you’re actually in love, Tetora-kun…

Nah, it’s not like that! Besides, wouldn’t you be the one with all sortsa romantic stories?
You’re such a popular guy, too~ Didn’t you get the most chocolates out of all of us in Ryuseitai on Valentine’s Day?

Uu~… I don’t really have any interest in that right now… Romance is such a pain…

Ohh, you talk like you’re experienced!

I’m not, though… There’s just no time for love affairs right now… Not when it’s graduation season, the most depressing time of all…
I just wanna skip past this point already…
I wanna time travel to the future when I’ve gotten through all the goodbyes and sorted my feelings out… Everything sucks right now… I wanna die…

Ahaha, you’ll never sort through your feelings at that rate, Midori-kun.
You shouldn’t look away — You gotta face this stuff head on.
There’s no use complaining ‘bout it. Right now, we should let our seniors know how we feel while they’re still around.
Even if it’s hard to do it right, I wanna make sure I convey my feelings.

You’re so brave, Tetora-kun… I can’t even stand the thought of it…

Jeez, Midori-kun! You’re not gonna get anywhere if you keep running away!
Maybe that’s how you can avoid pain, and maybe that’s easier for you in the end, but personally, I just feel like that method’s empty and lonely.

Tetora-kuuun~ Are you ready?

Ah, yes! I’m coming, Narukami-senpai~♪

Huh…? Isn’t that person from Knights…? Were you on good terms with them, Tetora-kun?

Ahh, yeah, just recently! She’s teaching me the secrets to manliness~ I’m gonna do some training for that today, too!
Ehehe, Narukami-senpai’s been helping me so much…
We may even end up in a magazine together! She’ll try and recommend me as the next manly candidate!

Wha—? They’re teaching you about manliness?
A-Are they okay with that…? Don’t they, like, um… dislike that kind of stuff…?

Yeah, I didn’t understand that at first and ended up hurting her… But I’ve learned my lesson, and I don’t intend on ever doing it again.
The first step to becoming manly is to learn all about women, after all.
I’ll never be able to reach the right answer by researching one side of the coin.
It’s ‘cuz we have darkness that light stands out, so it’s ‘cuz women exist that I’ll be able to grasp what it means to be a man.
…Well, I say all’a that, but even I don’t fully understand it right now.
But I felt somethin’ light up in me. I know for sure I can become a man among men if I keep at it!
One day, I’ll even become a man who can proudly stand in front of Taishou and Taichou — to everyone, even the Sun itself!

Huh… I don’t fully get it, but you do seem a little different lately…
Our classmates have been saying the same, too…
That you look much more mature…

Huh? Really?
I’ve started to use cute accessories from fancy shops on a daily basis, so if anything, I feel like I’ve been lookin’ much more childish lately…?

Ahh, yeah, you’ve been using a lot of cute stuff lately, haven’t you…
I was in over my head to think it was ‘cause of me and my love for mascots, huh…? It was actually ‘cause of them…

It’s ‘cuz of you, too, Midori-kun~ I didn’t like that sorta stuff in the past much, though, ‘cuz I thought it looked kinda wimpy.
But… Being good at violence, or having lots of muscles isn’t the only way to prove your strength, right?
Being kind enough to laugh off and forgive your junior for making a dumb mistake is also a sign of strength.
I wanna be strong like that, too.
Instead of forcibly scrapin’ off my effeminate parts, I wanna turn it into a strength like kindness — And then I’ll wrap myself in it, and grow into a great man.
Just like her. First things first: I gotta start learning to love that side of myself~♪




Translation Notes
↑ Originally, Ritsu says “You won’t get anywhere playing Shogi with an animal.”↑ Originally, Madara refers to his sister as a Hikikomori, which is a term to refer to people who are withdrawn from society, especially in public.↑ Okama is a Japanese derogatory term used towards effeminate men.↑ Usually I translate 女々しい memeshii as sensitive/soft, but considering this story is related to gender, I decided it’d be best to keep it literal (the literal meaning is effeminate/like a girl).↑ “Reserved” in Japanese is lit. “watery,” hence why Ritsu mentions that vampires aren't good with running water.↑ Tetora's name lit. means &quot;Iron Tiger&quot;. (It's also in his solo song names, IRON HEART TIGER).]]></content>

zz… zz…♪
…Mmm—H-Huh? Was I asleep?

Good morning, Takamine-kun~♪

Hwa? Aah, umm…?

Hehe, you’re still half-asleep~ Do you know where you are? Or could it be that you don’t remember my name?

No, I remember… You’re my classmate, and everyone’s unique here so… Also my house is a home business, so it’s fundamental to learn people’s names…
Um, Shino-kun… Did I sleep through the whole class by any chance…?

That’s right~ And then classes ended with you still sleeping, you sleepyhead.
You looked like you were having a good sleep, so I couldn’t get myself to wake you up. But I’m on day duty today, so I can’t go home yet if you’re still around.

You could’ve woken me up then… I-I’m sorry, okay…?
Ahh, dammit… I’ve been so tired lately. Ryuseitai’s practice sessions are getting more and more severe…
I’m still not used to this idol stuff…
Um, Shino-kun… I’ll help you out with your duties as an apology…

Ah, don&#39;t worry~ It’s all done with.
I’m usually doing part-time jobs in school, so I’m used to these trivial jobs, and I’m also good at them.

I see… Uuu~ But I really do feel bad for this…
Oh, I know, I’ll give you carrots as an apology… I also have asparagus…♪

Huh? Why do you carry around vegetables with you? It’d help with my food expenses though, so I would be happy to take it~♪
(Hehe, whenever Takamine-kun talks, he&#39;s usually mumbling like he&#39;s in a bad mood, and he&#39;s pretty big…)
(I thought he was a bit of a scary person at first.)
(But when I talked to him, he was surprisingly easy to get along with… like he has a soft-like feel to him…♪)

(Shino-kun really is a good kid… I wonder how you&#39;d have to be raised to turn out this way…)
(He&#39;s kinda timid and gets startled over things at the very same time I would, so I feel a connection…)

…Umm, what is it? I feel weird being stared at—you&#39;re good looking, so it strangely makes my heart beat fast.

Ah—Sorry, people tell me that often… Sometimes I get weird misunderstandings when I look at other people&#39;s bags with mascot plushies attached to them…
Hehe… There’s no point in chit-chatting like this, so how about we go home…?

That’s true~ But I have nothing to go home immediately to do.
It’s raining heavily outside, right? Us Ra*bits scheduled to have practice on the roof, but had to hold it off in the end.
And it’s a scramble to get the indoor practice rooms on rainy days…
It looks like we couldn&#39;t get to rent one now. It’s times like these that I feel how tough it is being a frail unit.
But I can practice at home. I plan to do some independent training~
The walls are thin at home though, so I can’t really be moving around and singing so loudly.

That so… Ryuseitai had just finished a big job, so we&#39;re on break now…
And if I go home I’ll just be told to help out in the store, so maybe I’ll go somewhere else to kill time…
Going to my Basketball Club for practice is also tiring… Maybe I’ll borrow a book from the library room and read it casually…

Oh, you read books too? I didn&#39;t expect that~♪

Well, only sometimes… I like to read books at home rather than going outside… I’m pretty much an introvert, so~♪

Me too~ I like to read books, draw art, look at the stars…
I prefer that over sports activities, and I work with hobbies like that better.
Ehehe. If you’d like, how about we go to the library together?
I just remembered I have a borrowed book that I have to return soon, so I have to go there at some point anyway.
But only if it isn’t a bother, of course~♪

It’s not a bother at all… Just looking at you soothes me…♪

Really? That makes me happy~ I’m Ra*bits, so I should be like a little animal who soothes you. Ehehe, bounce bounce~♪
—Wah!?

Watch out!
Be careful, okay? It’s raining today, so the floors are easier to slip on…

O-okay. Ahh, I was this close to falling over… I shouldn’t be frolicking around… Ehehe, thank you for holding me back up.
Takamine-kun, you really do have a heroic feel to you…♪

Here I go~♪
Woosh, sliiidee~♪

Ooh… Shino-kun, you&#39;re amazing… You got a 3.57 meter record.

Yaaay~♪ A new record~!

My turn now, huh… My steps are bigger so I should have an advantage…
Sliiide~♪
Ahh nope, I get scared halfway that I’ll trip and immediately stop myself…

Ehehe, Player Takamine reached a record of around 2.3 meters~♪

&quot;Player&quot;…?

My turn now, sliiide~♪
Oh! Did I make a new record again?

Yep… You definitely passed over four meters, I think you may be a genius…

Ehehe, sliding on the slippery corridor while on the way to the library is really fun.
Although at this rate, we won&#39;t reach it.

It’s fine though, isn&#39;t it? It’s not like we&#39;re in a hurry… The book you borrowed won’t be due until a little later too, right…?
Besides, this is fun… You think up some great things, Shino-kun…

Hehe, I’m poor, so I usually play games that don&#39;t cost money.
Like trying to make mazes in notebooks or braiding my little sister&#39;s hair~♪

That&#39;s amazing… I never know what to do with my time, so I’m envious…

Hey! Don’t play in the corridors!

Eeek…!?

Woah—!? Shino-kun, don&#39;t hide behind me…
(Ooh… He&#39;s trembling… What&#39;s wrong…?)
(I don’t really get what’s up, but I have to protect him.)

Hmm? Ryuseitai&#39;s Takamine and Ra*bits’… Shino, is it. Don&#39;t play around so much here.
It’s gotten slippery from the rain, so you could slip and hurt yourself if you aren&#39;t careful enough.
Hmph… I suppose you don’t seem to be actually violating any rule though, so I’ll let it slide this time.
The weather report says the rain&#39;s only going to get worse. Instead of fumbling around, go home immediately.

Ah—Alright, got it… Sorry…

There&#39;s no need to apologize. You guys did nothing wrong… Just be more dignified—So incorrigible.

(Ah, he left… What was that about… I think we got scolded for some reason though…)
(I guess he was just warning us not to slip and hurt ourselves… So basically he was worried about us or something…?)
(Hmm, but there are other ways to say that, right…?)

………

Shino-kun…? It’s okay now, the vice-president went off somewhere, so…

D-Did he? I&#39;m so glad~ I&#39;m sorry for hiding behind your back… I don&#39;t really know how to deal with Akatsuki members…

I get it… Those people are kinda scary, aren&#39;t they…
Although, when you compare that glasses-vice-president to the person who carries a sword or the karate club person, he seems weak…
But I get nervous just remembering he’s an upperclassman or part of the Student Council…
Whenever Morisawa-senpai does something dumb, that person usually scolds him with a death glare…
So even though I haven’t actually done anything wrong, just encountering him makes me think I might get scolded viciously…
My big bro is also clever, and they’re pretty similar, so I cower back at encounter…

Ah, so you have an older brother? I’m also an &quot;Onii-chan&quot;~ I have a cute little sister and brother…♪

Ooh, I’m envious of you being the &quot;Onii-chan&quot;… I’m sure you have a warm family…♪

AAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!??

…!? Wha—!?

W-What!? There was a weird voice just now, right? A scream…!?

I-I didn&#39;t just hear a scream, wasn&#39;t there also a rumbling sound of something crashing down? Like something heavy fell down!
D-Did thunder strike down…?

E-Excuse me~

Hey, let&#39;s go back Shino-kun, I have a bad feeling about this… This is scary, what&#39;ll we do if it’s some ghost…?

Hehe, you believe in ghosts and such, Takamine-kun?

Uuu… Of course not, but it being scary or not is a different story…
When I was young, I was told if I get picky about food then the Wasteful Ghost will come over, and it’s traumatized me since…
My parents or brother would go overboard and start throwing rotten tomatoes at me saying &quot;What a waaaste~♪ What a waaaste~♪&quot;…… I hate it, I hate rotten tomatoes…

Oh, I was told something like that by my parents, too. They didn&#39;t throw tomatoes at me though, that would&#39;ve instead been a waste.
Hehe, this must be a thing in our area. You live nearby, right?

Yep… In the greengrocers store in the shopping district…

Oh, that&#39;s right. Then I might’ve bought things from there before.
But vegetables are usually cheaper when bought from a supermarket, so probably not that many times.

I can’t even respond to that… We can&#39;t win against big companies that can make large amounts of their product and send it all over their branches… Small businesses are so tough…

Ehehe, but from now on I’ll go to you, since it’s your store.

Ah, then I’ll also sell you the average quality vegetables for cheap… Your home isn&#39;t that well off after all…
You&#39;re usually nibbling on bread crusts during lunch break…

Oh, that would be a huge help. We&#39;re not so poor to the point of food being a problem, but since my siblings are still growing, I always prefer to use my food expenses on them instead, no matter what.
Ah—I ended up chatting away… I shouldn’t be relaxing like this.

I ended up doing the same too… It&#39;s easy to talk to you, so it just happened on it’s own…

Really? That&#39;s the first time I’ve been told that~ Since I’m bad at talking, you see~♪

AGHHHHHHHH!!??

Eeek!? T-There&#39;s that scream again…!

Hnn… W-We really weren&#39;t imagining it then. It’s still scary, but it was the right choice to check what&#39;s going on.
If there’s a scream, then it must mean someone’s in trouble, right?
I don&#39;t really know what happened, but we have to save them.

You&#39;re right about that… Ermm, where did the scream come from…? There’s thunder loudly booming outside so I can&#39;t really tell…

Hmm… It has to be in the library though. But I don&#39;t see anyone here, do you?

Shino-kun, can&#39;t you follow the trail of the sound…? You&#39;re a rabbit after all, right…?

Eh? Well I am in Ra*bits, but I don’t have ears as good as one…
But I’m fairly good with scents, maybe I can trail it through smell like a doggie?
(Sniff, sniff)… Oh! I smell vegetables from you.

Ahh, that’s &#39;cause I have them with me as emergency snacks… I’m still annoyingly growing up so I can get hungry easily…
Would you like to eat a carrot, Shino-kun…?

Hehe, you really do think of me as a real rabbit, don&#39;t you?

Umm… Sorry for interrupting your fun chatter, but pleeease help me.

Wah… Is that you, Aoba-senpai?

Is it someone you know…?

Ahh, um, he&#39;s the library committee member.
He’s usually there whenever I go to the library, and he sometimes helps me out in finding books, so that&#39;s how I’ve talked to him before.
Umm, Aoba-senpai, what happened? Were those screams we were hearing for some time now from you…?

Uuu… That voice is Hajime-kun, right? P-Please lend me a hand!

I’d love to but… Umm, Aoba-senpai, where exactly are you? I can hear your voice, but I don&#39;t see you, you know~?

Ah, I think its somewhere here… Look, there&#39;s books scattered about…

Ah, you&#39;re right! Aoba-senpai~ Are you here?

…………

Eugh, somebody died… Don&#39;t look, Shino-kun…

Wha? Huh? Why? I don’t like my eyes covered~!

I-I&#39;m more or less alive~ Hello Hajime-kun, and…?

Ah, hello… I’m Takamine, in the same class as Shino-kun…
Er, Aoba-senpai, right? What are you doing over there…?
From what I can see, it seems you got flattened down by the collapsed bookcases…?

Yes, that&#39;s exactly what happened~!! Please help me!
They all fell down one after the other like dominoes, I couldn&#39;t move away fast enough!
I dreaded I might die buried alive like this… Ahh, how unlucky… Is it all because I lent my lucky item to Rei-kun?

Content Warning: Suicidal ideation.

Ahhh, you really saved me! It really is good to have kind juniors~♪

I’m really glad you&#39;re safe~ But why were you trampled down by bookcases?
Takamine-kun had the physical strength to make it through, but I would have never been able to help you out of there if I were on my own.
I don&#39;t really understand how this happened, but please be more careful, okay?

I got scolded by my junior…! Ughh, it’s not like I like being trampled by bookcases either!
I was organizing the bookcases as part of my duty as a committee member. During these times, the old books get moldy from the rain, so I was carrying all the valuable old books down to the underground archive where the humidity level is adjusted for preservation purposes.
In their place, I’d carry up books from the archive to put them in the blank spots of the bookcase.
In other words I’m, well, swapping books. It’s tough doing this when there aren&#39;t enough committee members.

Um, before that, what is the underground archive?

Ahh, there&#39;s something like a library downstairs. I also only learnt about it when a friend told me in my first year.
And because it’s underground, nowadays it has old books you can&#39;t get a hold of, and there&#39;s even prohibited-looking books collected from somewhere by Natsume-kun in there. It’s pretty interesting.
If you’re ever interested, I’ll show you around sometime.
But right now I don’t have my glasses and I can’t really see well. Just walking is difficult, so I can’t do it now.

Ah… Now that you mention it, you really aren’t wearing your glasses today.
The impression you give off changes dramatically, you look like an elite from a prestigious school~♪

Yeah, you look like my big bro…

Huh? In what way are you seeing me? I haven&#39;t looked at myself in the mirror without glasses for a while, so I really don&#39;t remember how I looked without them!

Hehe, you look cool~ I think you look more superb without glasses~♪

Is that so? Ooh, you youngsters are making me blush!
But my glasses are my lucky item, so I don&#39;t usually want to take them off, you know~?

Hehe. You really like things like fortune-telling, lucky charms, and Buddhist prayers, right? Even your book cover is somewhat mandala-patterned.

Ahh, I got that from a friend long ago. It’s worn out by now, but it’s something that has memories to it, so I can&#39;t get myself to throw it away.

I know what you mean~ I dried up a flower I received from Tomoya-kun and now use it as a bookmark.
Tomoya-kun saw it when he came to my house a few days ago, and I got pretty embarrassed…
He didn&#39;t seem to remember the flower, though.

I think the conversation went way off track… Um, Aoba-senpai, like we asked, why were you trampled by bookcases…?
I feel uneasy not knowing the answer to things like that, so…

Ahh, sorry. Erm, like I said, I was organizing books.
I lent my glasses to a friend for a little while, or well, midway at work they were taken away from me…
So I couldn&#39;t see very well and, um, an accident happened.
I lost my balance on the stepladder and collapsed on the bookcase…
The impact made it tip back over to me, like the bookcase was saying &quot;it’s my turn now&quot; as it toppled over me.
Ahh, I really thought I was going to die… And today&#39;s been raining heavily, so everyone’s already gone home or something—No matter how many times I yelled for help no one came over.
I was this close to thinking about giving up on this world and finding happiness in the next lifetime.
Not that there&#39;s any proof that you can be reborn again, though~ Even if I did reincarnate, I’d probably be a bug or something.
I’ve committed many sins, after all.

Hey! What&#39;s all this fuss about!?

Hiiahhh!?
D-d-d-don&#39;t scare me like that, Keito-kun!
…It is you, right? I can&#39;t see well so I’m not sure! You&#39;re not some thunder, right? Even though I heard an explosive rumbling sound!?

Aoba.  …What happened to your glasses?

Ahh, I ended up lending them to Rei-kun.
He was saying something like he was bored because of the rain, so I suggested he borrow some books.
But it seems like he couldn&#39;t read small text, so he just took my glasses with him.

That&#39;s unfortunate. So that vampire is causing trouble to people as always, huh…
I was even thinking he was finally being more considerate to his surroundings, but people don&#39;t change that easily, it seems.
Well, it’s fine. Wait here a bit, Aoba. I’ve been keeping some spare glasses in the Student Council office, so I’ll bring them over. What&#39;s your eyesight?

Hmm… I’m not sure. I haven&#39;t done an eye test in a while, so I don&#39;t know.

Hmph. If you have time to go to a fortune-teller or a medium for weird consultations, then at least go get an eye test, too. You are absolutely beyond help.

I’m back. Now then, choose any glasses you like.

Ehehe, how&#39;s it looking, Takamine-kun? I think I got it to look cute~♪

Uh, don&#39;t expect me to be able to judge aesthetically… I have no idea… I feel like hairstyles can be as whatever…?

…Exactly what are you people doing?


Ah, welcome back Keito-kuuun! You were really quick, just like you said you’d be!

What’s this all about, Aoba? If I&#39;m seeing this right, it appears that your junior is fiddling with your hair…?
If you don&#39;t like it, then say so. Why are you being so timid?

Ahh, please spare me the lecture. I’m aware I’m hopeless, but if I’m constantly being told that I’ll definitely get mopey about it.
Besides, it’s not like I don’t like it~
When I complained about my hair suffocating me from the humidity of the rain, he said he&#39;d tie it up for me.
And then I ended up letting him do as he likes.
I can&#39;t do my work anyway since I can&#39;t see anything without glasses, so I thought of taking a break while waiting for you~

I’ve said this far too many times, but if your hair irritates you, then get a haircut.

And I keep telling you that no can do, it’s part of a Buddhist prayer so I can&#39;t cut it.
Though, during rainy days, it starts curling up from the humidity and feels ticklish on my skin.

I know what you mean~ I also can&#39;t cut my hair due to how Ra*bits works, but during these days it’s really humid, so combing my hair is tricky.

Ah, a buddy! Handshake~♪
Although I think your hairstyle suits you perfectly, so it&#39;s fine as it is.
But for me it doesn&#39;t seem like it suits me, doesn&#39;t have a single advantage, and only causes a great deal of pain~ Even Natsume-kun often gets angry at me for it.

I think it&#39;s best to do your hair as you like though… Summer&#39;s coming soon, so if you keep it long, it&#39;ll probably get all the more suffocating…

Hehe. Well, having long hair has its benefits too.
Whenever my sister wants to do a new hairstyle, she attempts it on my hair first.
Maybe it’s to release stress, but she usually makes it into an endless braid.
She likes my hair a lot, saying &quot;Onii-chan, don&#39;t cut it!&quot;
But my little brother says I look like a girl with long hair… He&#39;s too embarrassed about it, and we no longer have baths together.

Ahaha, not that it matters too much, but you fiddling with my hair while we talk makes it feel like we really are in a barbershop~♪

Is that so? What would you like your hairstyle to be, mister? Would you like a bit of trimming~? Just kidding~♪

…Well, isn&#39;t it nice that you&#39;re all having fun.

Ah, I’m sorry… I shouldn&#39;t be making noise in the library, I’ll reflect on it.

So long as you understand it’s fine. There isn&#39;t anyone else here for the library, so I’ll overlook it this time… You don&#39;t have to be so obedient about it, Shino.

Ah, alright. Umm, so you know who I am?
I thought the vice president, a person from Akatsuki, wouldn&#39;t be interested in who we were.

…Don&#39;t give me that ill-mannered tone.
Hmph. So you have more backbone than you look, in fact I’d say it makes it a good thing about you.
If you&#39;re going to snarl at me then you’re on, come at me whenever.

………

Ahaha, don&#39;t make him all tense pleeease, this is a place to enjoy books peacefully.

That&#39;s true… That aside, you have work to do as the library committee member, don&#39;t you? I basically finished my duties for the Student Council, so I’ll help out if you want.

Eh, are you sure? It&#39;d be a huge help, thank you Keito-kun~♪

Don&#39;t thank me. I was originally a committee member, but then threw that duty onto you, and you ended up fumbling about on your own from then on.
I feel a little bad about that.
Let me make up for it at least, or else I won&#39;t feel like I can move on.

Hehe. There&#39;s a lot of implications behind your words… I need better reading comprehension for this~ You troublesome person.

That&#39;s just how I am. I can&#39;t change this late in.


…That aside, Aoba, choose your glasses. I’ve brought frames that would suit you, and the lens come in variety, so adjusting the strength should be possible.

Waaah, I&#39;m sincerely, extremely saved by this. Why do you have so many kinds of glasses with you?
As always, you love glasses, don&#39;t you, Keito-kun~♪

Well, I’m the type that, when I get attached to something, I pursue it to the end. If I had inherited the temple like normal, I would&#39;ve probably become a monk who practices austerity.[1]

Ahaha, nothing happens once you die~ So please live as long as you can, okay? I&#39;ll try to do that too, as much as I&#39;m allowed to.
But well, if it ever ends up seeming impossible, I&#39;ll put my hope on the afterlife and hang myself!

There&#39;s no such thing as reincarnation, or at least I don&#39;t accept that idea. You work hard in this lifetime.
If you live on, you get to have your hair tied up by your cute junior, and other things too… There&#39;s surely good to living, you know?

Here I go, Vice President-san~
I’ll put the books from the higher areas down there. It’s a dictionary, so it’s pretty heavy, and my arms might get wobbly…
I apologize if I lose my grip.

Hm, alright, go for it. I’ll hold onto the stepladder you&#39;re climbing.
Be careful. There&#39;s no need to rush, so just do it slowly.

Yes! Alright then, heave-ho…☆

Ghfff!??

Aah—I-I-I-I&#39;m so sorry!! It landed directly on your face! Are you okay!?

…Did you do that on purpose? Do you really hate me that much?

A-Absolutely not! There’s been thunder crashing down for a while now, and every time it happens I jump!

Wanna change places, Shino-kun…?

Ah, I’m fine, the bookcases around here are in a complicated layout…
So no one but me can enter these cracks—or rather, reach the books we&#39;d need.
Hehe, since everyone&#39;s really well-built here.
That must be so nice… I want to grow bigger too, but I can’t really build up the muscle.
I really do have to start eating better food for this, don&#39;t I?

I wouldn&#39;t say you&#39;re that small, though… Aren&#39;t you the most well-built out of all of Ra*bits…?

No no, my family&#39;s surprisingly tall, so I&#39;m the second shortest.
And if I get bigger I think I wouldn&#39;t be as cute…? It wouldn’t be Ra*bits-like…? That&#39;s what I think at least, but we&#39;re all in our growing periods, so…♪

Hey, quit blabbering about and move your hands.

Ahh, I&#39;m sorry!

You shouldn&#39;t nag about everything, Keito-kun~
You can help to the best that you can, okay?
This is primarily my job, so just having everyone help me out is… It&#39;d make me feel bad if you overdo yourself.

No no, I’ll do my very best!
Ehehe, I owe you a lot, and I doubt I can go home because of the heavy rain, so…
I’ll pass the time here until the rain fades.

If it’s passing time you want, then that’s exactly why it&#39;s better to read some books… You really are a good boy, Hajime-kun.

Hehe. I feel like I’m holding people back and only being a bother, though.

Not at all, you&#39;re really helping me out here~ If I can finish organizing the underground archive, it&#39;ll be one thing done with.
This place isn&#39;t like upstairs and hadn&#39;t been touched, so it&#39;s been an enormous amount of work.
Natsume-kun did as he pleased and made it sound-proof…
So you can play some music, or be noisy to an extent, so long as you make all the bookcases fixed in their place.
That&#39;s why, I’ve always thought about letting kids who can&#39;t borrow a lesson room come here instead whenever there’s heavy rain.
And so that I can do that, I’m taking all the valuable books to the Secret Room.
I don’t think anyone will steal them, but it’s just in case. There’s really no reason to rush, so please take your time.

Ahh, if you can make this room a place to practice that&#39;d be helpful.
A frail unit like us can never rent practice rooms… So we end up having a massive amount of free time on days like these.

Huh, so you&#39;ve thought of something like that, Aoba.

Eh? Is this possibly something I shouldn&#39;t do without permission?

Well, normally you should be getting permission. If you report it to us we&#39;ll accept it.
Lately the academy&#39;s been very lively with activities, and the insufficient amount of practice rooms and other has been a problem, so this is good timing.
This is only a suggestion, but you could make it so that as a reward for helping out with the library work, people can then use the underground archive as a practice room.
Your problem will be resolved in a swipe. How about it?

You&#39;re all about efficiency, aren&#39;t you~ Alright then, I’ll write the document with that notion.
But before that, I should at least get things done with to the barest minimum. With the speed it&#39;s going, I&#39;ll be done by dawn after an all-nighter.

Go home when you’re meant to.
…The same goes for you two. If the rain doesn&#39;t stop, I’ll prepare a car and force you to go home. If I ask my brother, he should bring a car over.

Your household’s car isn&#39;t a hearse or something, right?

We have a normal car, too. We have a lot of work at the temple that needs us to go around everywhere, so my brother put the benefit and the interest for cars together, and started collecting vehicles.
Kiryuu saw his motorbike and was incredibly impressed.

Hmm, your brother does seem the type to like that stuff. But I’m kind of bad at dealing with him~ He starts lecturing me whenever we meet.
Though, well, you were like that in the past, too.

It’s because I can&#39;t exorcise your darkness, since I’m a novice. I still need more training.

Ummmm… I have a small question; this book has a sequel, right…?
I really liked this story when I was young, so I wanna read it after so long…

Which book?
Ahh… I&#39;m sorry to say this, but… the author of that book passed away, so it&#39;s forever a discontinued series.
I read it before too; it ended right at a really good part, didn&#39;t it? I really get how you feel about wanting to know what happens next.
Ah—But there&#39;s a fan work by a fan of the story who wrote their own sequel, and I know just where it is.
I think that fan was as curious as you and ended up writing it.
Keito-kun, Keito-kun, that book… Do you have the books by Mizuhanome-sensei around with you?

I almost want to say that I burnt them, but it’s probably somewhere in the storage room if I were to look for it.
I’m warning you now though, it&#39;s nothing compared to the original. Just an amateur fan work… It&#39;s nothing interesting.

Hehe, I thought it was really well written, though~ I liked it.

I’m not satisfied with it. Mizuhanome-sensei thought it would be impossible to convey the original author’s world view in a manga, so they[2] uncharacteristically put together a text-only work instead, but…
It just went to show how inexperienced they were as a writer, and that they’d been using their art to compensate for it.
I got a lot of advice from you on how to write… Aoba.

…? Mmm, I got mixed in with some conversation…?

Don&#39;t worry about it. It has nothing to do with you, it&#39;s only a story of the past.

Hehe, you see Takamine-kun, Keito-kun may not look it, but he really likes to think up stories-

Aoba! Stop saying needless things!

Ahaha, you don&#39;t have to be so flustered~♪

You really make me want to punch you sometimes. No wonder you were Eichi&#39;s biggest friend; you even rub me the wrong way just like him.
You better come over to my temple once for training, that way I can beat you up without needing to hold back.

I don’t like being hurt~ I keep telling you I’m not an animal, so you don&#39;t have to hurt me for me to understand. Just words would be enough.

Hmph, anything said to you is just wasted effort.

Ehehe, you two get along well~ I didn&#39;t expect it.

That&#39;s how you see it? As you can see, this guy&#39;s the type you can&#39;t leave alone, so I end up severely lecturing him, that&#39;s all.
We&#39;re absolutely not friends.

Eeh~ We&#39;re friends though, aren&#39;t we? We were both bookworms since long back, and ended up meeting each other often in the library, and that&#39;s how we ended up talking.
We even lent each other our favorite books and stuff.
If only I could have aaalways had friendships that were easy-going like that but… Life doesn&#39;t go as you always want it to, does it?

That&#39;s why I think it&#39;s interesting. That&#39;s how I’ve started to think lately.

I can feel the implications behind all that~ Ehehe, even though we&#39;re only a few years apart… Third years really do have a mature feel to them.

We&#39;re only putting up a front, you know~? We&#39;re all just sensitive delicate teenagers, after all.
Don&#39;t think of us as adults who can take in anything; please go easy on us too, okay?

Don&#39;t say something so pathetic. Shino, it&#39;s fine, alright? If you ever have anything to say, go ahead and say it. Even if it’s hostile or hatred, feel free to hit it at us.
Although I’d rather you don&#39;t hit me with a book. I&#39;ll die if you hit a critical spot, and the book might dent, too. You’re so damn rash.

Like I said, that wasn&#39;t on purpose, really! …I-I’ll be okay next time! I’ll do my best, I’ll definitely do it right!
Here I go~ Heave-ho! ☆

Oh, you did it perfectly this time, good job, good job~♪

Shino-kun&#39;s a real hard-worker…
Umm, I’ll do some work too… I look like I&#39;m the only one who&#39;s slacking off while everyone&#39;s doing their best… It feels all wrong…

Hehe, alright then, please help me out a bit. We&#39;re going to be pasting barcode labels onto old book collections.

Ah, I kinda like doing small work like that…♪

I thought so~ Just because you&#39;re well-built doesn&#39;t mean I should assume you like manual labor, right?
Ah, that&#39;s right… I’m changing the subject but… I just remembered Natsume-kun asked me to think about a live show that&#39;s enticing exactly because it’s on a rainy day.
It&#39;s fine if you keep working, but if it&#39;s alright, I’d love to think up ideas with you all.
If you think up something that can be used as material, then telling me about it is good enough.
Three people together have the wisdom of Manjushri[3], so with four people, we&#39;ll think up something even greater.

By the way, Manjushri is a bodhisattva that governs wisdom—

Ah, we really don&#39;t need that kind of trivia~
I’m sure we’d all love to talk more, but talking around so many books might make the mold and dust get in your trachea and hurt your throat.
That&#39;s why I didn&#39;t want help from idols, since it might be a problem to have that happen… But I was lonely all by myself too, so I’m a little conflicted with my feelings.
But it&#39;s more or less a happy feeling, so I want to think this was the right choice.

Epilogue
Alright, we sorted most of it out.

Great work~ You really are amazing at this, Keito-kun. Ahh, I&#39;m sooo thankful for all the help.

Hmph. You don’t have to keep thanking us. It’s my duty to assist, that’s all.
We killed enough time until the rain showers passed, and I got to move around without needless thoughts for once, so I also feel thankful.
I have to think a lot when doing my Student Council work, and I’m the vice president so I can’t be shoddy with my work.
But since the library work is your job, even if I do make a mistake it&#39;ll be under your responsibility in the end.

Wha—You&#39;re cruel! Are you saying you don&#39;t care what happens to me!?

If I did, I would&#39;ve never helped you in the first place… If you need it, I’ll give the library committee some budget and get some new members. Do you?

Oh, no~ Actually, other than a special job like this, I usually have way too much free time, so it&#39;s enough with only me more or less.
Most of the big work that used to be for the committee was taken by the Student Council, anyway.
Like managing the budget of the school&#39;s funds like a bank, or the supervision over the school&#39;s social media.
Next year onward, the library will be like a sub-section of the Student Council and merge with them, right? So until then I’m here.
I’ll make sure to make it possible to hand it over in a way that won&#39;t let our juniors suffer, so please do help me out on that, Keito-kun.
Thank you so much for today.

Like I said, stop thanking me… Hm?

Oh, Anzu-chan! Good evening~ Do you have something you need at the archive?
You want to borrow books or materials? You&#39;ve come at the right time~ I just finished organizing the books~♪
What kind of book are you looking for?
—wh-AHH!?

That was close! Please be careful, Aoba-senpai…

I-I&#39;m sorry. I was this close to falling down… I’m not used to these glasses so my perception is all wobbly…

Do you have a problem with the glasses I lent you?

Nooo, that&#39;s not what I…
Wait, Takamine-kun, what are you doing sitting down here?
If you&#39;re not feeling well, I’ll help you to the infirmary, okay?

Ah, no, I’m used to labor work, so I’m feeling alright, but… It looks like Shino-kun got so tired out he ended up sleeping…

Zzzzz……♪

See… He&#39;s sound asleep while leaning right on my shoulder, so I can’t move… Sorry, I tried to help since I wasn&#39;t doing anything, but…
One of the books I picked up looked interesting and I ended up reading it only to sleep midway into it, and I ended up being no help at all…

Ahaha, it&#39;s fine~ It’s the thought that counts. I’m happy with that, enough for tears to come out.
You&#39;re all still kids after all, I’m not asking for end results.

Please don&#39;t treat me like a kid, our age doesn&#39;t differ that much… But I guess I can&#39;t say anything when this is how things turned out…
C&#39;mon, Shino-kun, wake up… It&#39;s dark outside, we should be going home now…

Mm~ (fumble)…… (nibble nibble) ♪

Ughh, don&#39;t eat my uniform… Eh, I’m gonna keep getting bigger and need to buy a change of uniform anyway, so I guess it’s fine…

Hehe, you two get along~ I’m jealous.

Hey, you&#39;ve left the transfer student all alone without a follow-up, respond back properly.

Aahh…? I&#39;m sorry about that, so what really brought you here… Anzu-chan?
Eh—You brought back my glasses?
I see… Looks like stuff happened on that side. So Rei-kun lost my glasses, and tried to look for them all over school?
Then he finally found them, but he was up all day so he got tired and ended up sleeping in his coffin…
And as substitute, you came to bring back the glasses instead, right?
It really would&#39;ve been fine if you had given them to Rei-kun… But that person surprisingly gets worried over things like this, huh.
Hehe, yep, I got them. It&#39;s been a while, my glasses~♪

Hold on Aoba, you&#39;re already wearing glasses so don&#39;t try to put another pair on top of them. The frames will get damaged, and the lens will get scratched up too.

Glasses this, glasses that, so annoying~ Mmm… My glasses are a bit dirty, so until I clean them up I’ll wear the glasses I borrowed from you, Keito-kun.
Since the friendship I feel from you is warm and makes me happy.

Hm… You&#39;ve said a prayer with those glasses, right? It&#39;s unusual of you to keep aside your &quot;lucky charm&quot; like that. What&#39;s with this change of mind, Aoba?

I’m changing too, bit by bit, you know? Changing ever so slowly alongside this academy…
And I&#39;m deeply hoping this change will be a good thing.
I can&#39;t stay as I was in the past, but I’m a dunce so I’m not changing all that well either…
But this should be much more delightful than halting myself in one place.
There&#39;s no such thing as a rain shower that won&#39;t stop, and if it rains, then you also get to see a lovely rainbow.
I look forward to things like that and hope that they&#39;ll be that way, and so… Today, tomorrow, and even the day after, I&#39;ll keep living.




Translation Notes

Chapter 1

    Location: Basketball Court


And it’s in! A three-pointer![1] Player Morisawa’s miracle shot…! ☆
Fuhahahaha! Justice always prevails!
…Siiigh… I’m so bored. Why do I have so much free time…
Hm? That person running towards here…
It’s Anzu! Heeey, Anzu! Here, I’m over here~!
Good morning! Today’s a fine day, isn’t it! ☆
Hm? “Thank you for coming here, despite calling you so suddenly”?
Ahaha, don’t worry about it. Ryuseitai is on break right now, and so’s my club.
I also finished watching all the pre-recorded tokusatsu shows I wanted to catch up with during the summer holidays.
I had an extremely high amount of free time, you see!
And even now I still do, so I came over here much earlier, and had been doing a “Basketball showdown between justice and evil!” thing, but — You can only go so far when playing alone…
It really is true when they say that boredom can kill people. Being busy might be better at this point.
…Hm? Anzu, why are you grinning?
Ahh, so you’re also the type to get distressed when there’s nothing to do.
Heheh, you are always saying stuff like, “It’s only natural for a producer to take care of their idols!”
Looks like you’re still working during summer holidays, and you even helped us out a lot during PirateFes and the beach house work!
Thank you for all of that, Anzu…☆
Alright, let’s hear why you’ve called me over! I’m ready for anything, like hanging out together thanks to the free time we’ve got~♪
Hmhmm… A new motorbike promotional vieo is going to be released?
You want me to accept a solo job, instead of doing it as part of Ryuseitai&#39;s activities…
I’m happy you asked, but why me?
The school rules have been changed, and students are now allowed to commute by bikes and stuff. There are plenty of people in my class who do so by motorbikes…
Ohh, that’s why! It’s going to have a concept similar to hero stuff, so you decided to ask me to do it.
I’ve ridden motorbikes before during stunt work, and I’m pretty interested—
Wait, hold on— A promotional video with motorbikes? And hero elements in it? I think there’s someone else more suitable for this than me!
I saw him just a second ago inside the school grounds, so he should still be around. Follow me, Anzu!


    Location: Bicycle Parking Area


Hmmhmmhm~♪
My cute, adorable baby-chan! Mama’s gonna pour all his love into youuu~☆


Mikejima-san!

Ohhh? Chiaki-san and Anzu-san! Oh, what’s this? Are you on a date? Good, good! You’re getting along so well!

Um, I’m not like that with Anzu, okay? You shouldn’t tease people when you already know it’s not true, Mikejima-san.

Hahaha. That may be true now, but you never know what could happen later on in your life. Didn’t you say you want a cute girlfriend?

Please stop. You’re making it awkward for her, too.
Anyway, I have something to ask of you. Do you have the time right now?

Yep, I’m all good. I can listen to what you have to say while I work on my motorbike, yeah? Although if it’s better that I pay full attention to you, then I’ll stop fiddling with my motorbike.

Oh no, you can carry on if you like. See, Anzu asked me to take part in a new promotional video for motorbikes.
I’ve ridden one before, and I’m fine with taking the job, but… You love motorbikes way more than I do, so.

Huh… Still, that doesn’t mean you have to hand over the job to me. Isn’t it fine if you just take it?

True, but look at you — You’re having a lot of fun tinkering with your motorbike, aren’t you?
That’s why I thought you’d be really happy to hear there’s a motorbike job!

You&#39;re the same as always, Chiaki-san…
Yeah, you’re right, it is a suitable job for me. And like you said, I do love motorbikes.
Besides, a hero that rides a motorbike would be a Kamen Rider. But you fit Ryuseitai, or well, the Super Sentai image way more.[2]
So if you also think about it like that, you’re definitely not wrong to think I’m suitable.

Heheh, right, right?
But still. It’s all up to you and your schedule. If you’re too busy to do it, it’s okay.

I don’t have a tight schedule as MaM right now, and I sure do love motorbikes.
I’d be glad to take on the job if it’s alright with you two~♪

Chapter 2
Ohh, you’ll take it?!
This is great, Anzu! Mhm, mhm, I’m indebted to you for many things, so I’m happy to know I could help you out~♪
(…That said, I have nothing to do again. Hmm, what to do…)
Actually, Anzu. Are you free after this?
O-Oh, you have other work to do. You really are a hard worker… Make sure to do your best without pushing yourself!

So you’ll tell me when it’s time to meet up for the promotional video’s briefing? Got it~! ☆
You don’t have to thank me, Anzu-san! We’re close, aren’t we!
Also, calling me “Mikejima-senpai” feels a little too formal for us, so I want you to call me “Mama”. C’mon, no need to be embarrassed about it~♪

Oh. She politely bowed her head and left.

Mmm, she just refuses to call me that, huh…
But Mama won’t give uppp~♪

Ahaha… It’s good to keep on trying without giving up, but don’t force it on her. Though I doubt you, of all people, would do that.

You overestimate me.
I could make her indebted to me and get her to call me “Mama” as thanks, but she’s my beloved, darling daughter — I wanna hear her say it at her own will.

…Alright, wonder what I’ll do next… Anzu can’t hang out with me either, so now what…

Chiaki-san. If you’ve got the time, could you help me maintain my motorbike?

Wha— Can I really?!

You know stuff about motorbikes, right?

Yeah! Not as much as you, but I do know a little!

That’s good enough! I’m more than happy doing this work while talking to someone rather than all alone in silence~♪

Really! Well, I’ve got tons of time, so I’ll do anything I can help you out with!

You’re acting pretty excited, huh? You really were bored.

Y-Yeah… Ryuseitai’s on break, and so’s my club. I honestly had way more free time than I could handle.

Then couldn’t you have asked the boys in your unit if they wanted to hang out? You’re all on your break, so I bet they’ve also got the free time.

Mmm… I’m sure they’re enjoying their time in their own way… I feel awkward asking them to hang out just because I’m bored.
They could be going out somewhere with their family or friends — I can’t go in and interrupt that just because of how I feel.
I would rather play all alone than do that!

Hmm… Well, if that’s how you feel, then okay.
Anyways, I was just cleaning the motorbike chains, so I’d like to ask you to remove the rust from the motorbike. If there isn’t that much rust, then you could spray the corrosion inhibitor on it instead.

Got it! Ahh, it’s great to have something to do…☆

Hahaha, that’s a nice smile right there! I’m having fun doing this with you, too~♪
Huh, you’re more used to this than I thought. Maybe I could ask you to do the more pesky parts, too.

Oh? What, what? Like changing the engine oil? Or maybe the brake pad instead?

Hahaha, you really do know a lot! I didn’t have anyone to talk to about motorbikes ever since I came back to school!
But now that you’re here, I could talk about it all day~☆

Ah, no! Don’t expect anything from me!
There’s another stuntman from my stunt work who loves motorbikes, see…
They’d talk to me about it for the whole day, but I didn’t know half of what they were saying, so I ended up letting them down!
Still! If someone likes something, I’ll do whatever I can to listen closely to what they’re saying! ☆

Hahaha, that’s just like you! Alright, I’ll have you replace the engine oil, so you should wear the rubber gloves.
Even if we can’t talk back and forth about motorbikes, we can still tinker with the motorbike together. That’s enough to make me super happy~♪

Chapter 3
~…♪
Okay, good, good. Now you’re a real beaut~♪[3] Thank the heavens and the gods! You’ve helped me out so much, Chiaki-san~♪

I’m happy to hear that, but… There wasn’t a single rusty area. The entire thing was already clean, so I didn’t really do much, y’know?
I can tell you’re always riding this motorbike with great care.

I’ve entrusted my life to this motorbike, so obviously I’d take extra care of her.
I even had this baby with me overseas, so if I have to name our relationship, she’s like my buddy.
You’ve got something like that too, don’t you?

Hmm, a buddy…
What do you mean by “buddy”?[4]

The literal meaning would be “partner,” yeah? If you’ve got something you’ve loved for a long time, or something that’s always with you, then I’d say you could call it your buddy.
As for me, I’ve loved motorbikes since I was a little kid. I used to beg my parents to buy me motorbike toys, and I’ve treasured them since.

Ah! That’d be my Super Sentai figurines, then! I’ve loved Sentai stuff since I was young, and used to asked my parents to buy me one.
I’d massage their shoulders, help them out with things, and do lots more. I’d get one point for each good deed, and once it reached ten points, they would buy me a figurine.
I remember being super happy when I finally got the figurine I’d longed to have — I couldn’t even sleep that night…♪

Ahaha, that’s just like you. If you’ve loved it for that long, then it means it’s something you truly love.
Kids tend to be interested in just about anything, but after they’ve grown older, they just end up thinking, “Why did I even like that?” for most of those interests.
Like, Anzu-san used to love cicadas and stuff — would even try and grab one.
But the other day, when I showed her a drone beetle I found, she just stared at me with this offended look.[5]
The older she grows, the less curious she gets…! A true shame!
But anyway… so your buddy is your Super Sentai figurines, huh?

Yep, you could say that. You should show me your motorbike toys next time. I want to show you my most prized possessions myself!

Yeah, I’m curious to see it, too.
…Oh right, we’ve been talking even after finishing the maintenance. Did I take much of your time?

Nope. Like I said, I have way too much free time on my hands, so I’d love to talk to you more if that’s alright!

Ooh, that so! Sure, no problem~♪
I’m always doing stuff solo, so it feels refreshing to be with someone for once.
Mhm, I guess it’s nice to have days like this every once in a while…♪


    Location: Shopping District



    Next day — Early morning…

Heave-ho, heave-ho… Woah! Awawa?!

Y-You okay…? I’ll hold it for you if it’s too much…

I-I let my guard down for a second, that’s all!

I’m really grateful that you’re helping me out, but it’d be real bad if you trip and drop the box…
I’ll carry the one you have, so you carry this one, okay…? It’s got asparagus in it, so it should be light…

Hnn, I deeply apologize for making you do this!

You’re not making me do anything… If you hadn’t come over to help me, I would have had to carry all of this on my own…
But y’know, I was really surprised when you phone called me out of nowhere… I mean, you don’t usually do that…

Ungh~ Yes, I’m bad with phone calls.
Even if I had exchanged numbers with someone, I keep stressing over whether it’s okay to casually call them or not… Most times, I just do not do it in the end.

Ahh, I know how you feel…
Actually, I even find exchanging numbers tiring, so I usually pretend I forgot my phone, and run away immediately…
Oh, sorry, we went off-topic… Sengoku-kun, didn’t you call me so you could ask if we could hang out…?
Then I told you that I had work to do for my family, and so you’re helping me out… Which I find really helpful, but…
If that’s what you wanted, then I feel kinda bad for making you do this with me…
I could get you some juice if I ask my parents for something in return, but otherwise, it’s free of charge…

Ahh, no, this is just what I wanted… I had mentioned before that I wanted to build more stamina during the summer holidays, correct?
And you said that you have the physical strength due to your greengrocer work, so I thought I could also build some if I were to help out!

Ohh, that’s why… So you get to build stamina, and I get to do this with your help, so it’s basically hitting two birds with one stone, huh…?

Yes! Same goes for me. I’m able to not only spend time with you on our break, but also build my muscles~♪

Heheh. Well if that’s what it is, then I guess I’ll go ahead and ask for your help…♪

Chapter 4
…………

Sengoku-kun? Why’d you stop walking all of a sudden?

Ahh, I saw a person who looked like Taichou-dono enter the toy store over there…

Ugh, what’s he doing in a place like that…?

Well, it is a toy shop, so he must have gone in to buy some? Nonetheless, I shall go and greet him~♪

Whaa… You don’t have to do that… I don’t wanna be near him as much as I can during summer… It’s already suffocating and tiring as it is…


Oohhh…☆ This is truly splendid!
To think I could arrange this figurine in my most admired pose…! It feels too good to be true!
Th…This is re-enacting that scene?! Truly incredible, shopkeeper! Of course you’d know all about it…! ☆

Hmm… It seems like he is speaking to the shop clerk about Sentai figurines.
He looks like he is enjoying himself, so I might end up interrupting his conversation if I greet him…?

H-He’s so embarrassing… I don’t want anyone to think we know each other, so I’m leaving now before he notices me…

Midori-kun? That path will only take longer to reach home, no~? Or could it be that you know a shortcut since you live here?
If so, I would love it if you could teach me the pathway! I am very enticed by the idea of shortcuts and secret passages — they are super ninja-like~♪

No no, there’s nothing like that here…
The thought of him spotting me freaks me out, so I’d rather take the long way home than deal with that… That’s all…
C’mon, don’t stand around… He may notice us if we’re not quick enough… I really don’t want that…

Well, you see, then…
Hm? Ah! That’s Takamine over there! And Sengoku!
Fuhahaha, fancy meeting you two here! ♪

Ughh, as soon as I said that…… No, you’re mistaking me for someone else… I don’t know you…

Huh?! Why are you saying that?! Did you forget all about me during our break?!
Alright! Then I’ll just have to make you remember! I’m Morisawa Chiaki! I’m in the same Basketball Club as you!
I go by Red in Ryuseitai, and you—

You’re way too loud! Ahhh, jeez! Everyone’s looking at us wondering what the heck’s going on now…!!
I take back what I said, okay… so please don’t do anything that’ll attract attention…

Okay. I’m glad to know that you hadn’t forgotten me!
Are you helping your family, Takamine? And I think Sengoku’s helping, too…?

I had free time, so I asked if I could help out! I also get to do some muscle building with this~♪

Ohhh! That’s admirable, Sengoku! Making sure to keep up training even during holidays is a true example of a hero! I’m extremely impressed! You’re doing great! (pat pat) ♪

Ehehe…♪ But was it really okay for you to come over to us when you were having fun talking to the shop clerk?

Hm? Ahh yeah, I can talk to them anytime.
Though I haven’t been there in a while, so I ended up getting really excited talking about all the new figurines!

So you’re a regular of that shop… I’m gonna stay away from it as much as I can…

Fuhahaha! ☆ Then I’ll come over to hang out in your home once I’m done visiting the shop!

That just sounds like harassment to me, ‘kay…?

C’mon, Midori-kun… Taichou-dono, do they sell ninja merchandise in there?
If so, then I might visit it after I have finished helping Midori-kun~♪

Hmm… You’re going to have to ask the shopkeeper that.
A lot seems to have changed since I last been here — There are all kinds of figurines in there now.
It made me realize how much I’ve missed out from not visiting just because I was “busy,” honestly!

Ahh… Yes, we have been busy even during the summer holidays — what with Pirate Festival and helping out at the beach house.
I do not typically go outside during the summer holidays, but I felt like an outdoor ninja this summer.

And I just wanted to laze about in my home the whole time…

Chapter 5
You guys! Look at my buddy here!

Buddy…? What are you talking about?

Heheh! I’m talking about the Sentai figurine I’ve treasured for years! It’s exactly what I’d call my buddy, my partner! ☆
I showed it to the shopkeeper, and they praised me for keeping it in such great shape!
C’mon, c’mon! No need to hold back! Come and take a good, close look…☆

Um, I’m not really interested…

Oh, don’t be like that! I’m sure you two will learn the beauty of Sentai figurines after a thorough look at my buddy!

Wait, why’re you even carrying that around with you…?

Heheh~ See, Mikejima-san and I were having a buddy discussion together, and it brought back so many memories!

A buddy discussion… That sounds quite interesting.

Wait, no… Sengoku-kun, don’t get yourself into this convo…

Oh!? Are you interested, Sengoku!? Great, that’s wonderful! Tell me more!
What would you say is your buddy?

Ughhh… you see? Now this whole thing’s turned into a huge bother…

My buddy… That would be Peachy and Thunder~♪
Ahem. I know exactly what Midori-kun will say!

No, it’s fine… Don’t drag me into this…

Your buddy would most definitely be a mascot character, correct? ♪

Guhh… I can’t deny that… I could never deny mascot characters…
Erm, right now the one I’m most passionate about is Captain Kidoairaku…[6]
I bought a keychain when we were at the beach house, and I asked the owner to make me a plushie version, too… Now I have it in my room, hehehe…♪

You become strangely energetic whenever mascot characters are mentioned, Midori-kun~
I feel that part of you is slightly similar to Taichou-dono.

Wha… I’m not letting you get away with saying that… Don’t put me in the same boat as him…

Fuhahaha, how harsh! I can feel hurt too, y’know! I’d rather you choose your wording more carefully!
Besides, it isn’t just the two of us. Anyone would get excited while talking about something they love!
Don’t you also get that way whenever you mention Peachy and Thunder, Sengoku?

Ahh… Now that you mention it, that is true… They are both my adorable partners.
I have them as my phone’s wallpaper, and—
Mm? I cannot take out my phone while holding this box.

It’s okay, you can set it down… My arms have gone numb from holding them for so long, too…

Very well. I shall place it in a corner, far from any likely harm.
Right, this would be my cute, adorable Peachy and Thunder~♪

Uh-huh… They’re frogs, alright… But personally, when it comes to frogs, I find the mascot character Kerororin cuter…[7]

Their skin patterns are different. Which one is which?

The one without patterns is Peachy, and the one with is Thunder~♪[8]
…I just realized something; are you supposed to have only one partner?
Uuu~ But I could never choose between Peachy and Thunder!
Ahhh!! This is a major problem~!!

Hm… I don’t think you have to choose between them.
I did say this Sentai figurine’s my buddy, but I actually have so many more figurines at home, and, well…
If I was asked to choose between all of them, I’d be at a loss!
You too, Takamine — Your buddy isn’t only Captain Kidoairaku, right?

Of course not! I love all mascot characters…☆

See, even Takamine can’t choose only one.
They say the more the merrier, and that means it’s fine to have as many buddies as you like!

Ohh…? When you say it that way, it does sound good…
Or really, it is just like you to think that way, Taichou-dono~♪

Chapter 6

    Location: Bicycle Parking Area


The twilight has arrived! Ahaha, it’s night time already!
(I didn’t have to stay in school for this long, but it took a while before I could finish up everything I was asked to do.)
(There’s students who still come to school in the summer break, so yeah… But honestly, they could’ve relaxed at home for the holidays, at least…)
(Not that I’m one to talk. It doesn’t really suit my style to sit at home, so I’m also hanging around the school during the break.)
…Hmm? Oh! That’s Anzu-san over there!
Heeey, Anzu-san! Anzu-saaaaaaaan!
Hehe, did you come rushing over here because I called for you? It’s still dark even with the street lights on, so you shouldn’t run, okay?
Hahaha! I see, I see! So it was embarrassing for you!
You were all the way over at the front gate, so you wouldn’t hear me unless I yelled, y’know?
Anyways, you’re going home now, right? It’s late in the evening by now, are you going to have your parents pick you up?
Ohh, they’re gonna come home late from work, huh? Then hop on my motorbike, and I’ll take you home~♪
Ahaha, no need to be modest. We’re close, aren’t we? ♪
Huh? How close? Well, we’re childhood friends, and have an idol-producer relationship, yeah?
It’s alright, you can take what I said as a figure of speech. Point is, anyone would offer to walk a young girl back to her home at night.
And your home is pretty far from here, and, well, there’s not as many trains at this hour, so you’ll probably reach home at midnight if you go by train.
Oh, now you’re sure you want a ride home? Mhm, mhm! You should depend on your Mama like that some more~♪
Hahaha! Why’re you acting like this is your first time riding a motorbike?
You don’t have to hesitate so much, just hop on! Don’t worry, she won’t hurt you~♪
C’moon, wear your helmet! It may be hot, but you can’t let yourself get hurt incase an accident happens, ‘kay?
The helmet’s there to protect your life.
…Mhm, good girl, good girl~♪
Riiighty then. I’ll be driving safely, but you should still cling onto me as much as possible, just in case…♪


    Location: Residential Area


Heeey, Anzu-san. Your house is right around this corner, right?
Ahh, no, you don’t need to get off yet.
…It’s only a turn away, so you can walk from here?
Ah, so I was right.
Long ago, when we played in the park together until late at night, I walked you back home myself, because everyone had gone home by then.
Huh? You don’t remember? Well, it only happened once, really.
We got scolded hard for playing past curfew, so maybe you erased the whole thing as a bad memory.
Including this part, too… Oh well! It’s fine if you forgot, it wasn’t anything important.
…Hm? You might be able to remember if I talk more about it?
It really wasn’t anything important. We just talked about our favorite stuff on our way home…
And you said you really loved your teddy bear.
You don’t remember? I see… Guess you really did forget.
Hm? Yeah, I said I loved motorbike toys.
I tried to get everyone to enjoy them with me whenever I played house, but no one was interested.
Heheh, I mean, to be fair, I was playing with girls mostly, you included…
And the boys were way more interested in huge monsters and spaceships, so it made sense that no one showed interest.
Hahaha! Yep, it’s as you say! I still love motorbikes to this day~♪
That’s why I’m really looking forward to this job!
The promotional video’s briefing is tomorrow, right? I don’t have anything else planned, so I’m free to work alongside you~♪
You don’t have to bow your head down in apology, y’know? I don’t feel forced to do this, so~♪
Hm? “Thank you for driving me back home”?
Ahh! Oh yeah, we’ve finally reached your house!
Right then, see ya tomorrow. Promise Mama you’ll go to sleep as soon as possible, ‘kay? ♪
Alright, bye bye~!

Chapter 7

    Location: Garden Space


Smooth sailing! The briefing went perfectly, all that’s left is the actual photoshoot!
I’m looking forward to this even more now~♪
Anzu-san, let’s do our best for the jooooooob! Let’s shake hands on it! Here, (handshakes)…☆
Huh? “Thank you for driving me back home yesterday”?
You told me that yesterday, y’know? You’re so polite, Anzu-san.
But it’s wonderful to show your gratitude properly~♪
Besides, I’m happy that we got to talk, so—… Hmmm?

Taichou-dono~! It went over there!

I’ve got this! …Alright, it stopped moving.
Take thiiiiis…! ☆
Ahhh!? It fled right at the last second! I was so close…!

Mm… You were trying to grab it from its back.
Grasshoppers can only jump forward, so it must be caught from its front. It’s my fault for not explaining this to you earlier, though.

Ahh… That’s right, I remember doing that as a kid when I tried catching them with my hands.
Ahaha! It’s been so long since I went bug catching, I completely forgot!

Ohh… You’re catching bugs?

Ohh, Mikejima-san! And Anzu’s here, too! Today’s a wonderful day, and the perfect day for catching bugs…☆

Heheh, you’re like a little kid, Chiaki-san. But why’re doing that?

Heh! We’re collecting food for Peachy and Thunder!

Peachy and Thunder…? Those sound like names for an Iga ninja…?

That’s right! How incredible, Mikejima-dono! Yes, Peachy and Thunder are the names of my frogs~♪

Ohhhh! Now I see why they were named that way~♪

Oh? Why are you tapping on my shoulder, Anzu-dono?
Ahh, is it only Taichou-dono and I catching bugs?
Midori-kun is with us, too. Wait, I just realized he is not beside us right now…
Ah! Heeey, Midori-kun! Over here, over here~♪

Sigh… I can’t believe you two are getting this excited over catching bugs…
And why am I being dragged along with this, anyway…?
Ughhh… I didn’t have any greengrocer work for once, so I just wanted to rest todayyyyy…

Now, now! You gain more from hanging out with friends than lounging about at home, don’t you?

That may be true for you, but to me, lazing about at home is way worth my time…
Ahh, dammit…! You just had to mention you were bored…!

Hoho. Chiaki-san, you said that? You couldn’t get yourself to mention it before, so what made you change your mind?

Ah, no. I just happened to see them yesterday, that’s all. I ended up mentioning how bored I was, and Sengoku invited me to hang out.
He also had the free time for similar reasons as mine, so he was more than happy to spend time together.
Heheh, looks like I was holding back more than necessary.

I see, I see! I’m glad you got to hang out with friends~♪

Chapter 8
Yeah! There was no reason to hold back — After all, they’re my buddies!

Buddies…? I thought your buddy was your Sentai figurine?

Of course. But I couldn’t really limit myself to only one, or well, there’s no need to!
These two here, as well as my two other comrades in Ryuseitai, are all my buddies…☆

Hahaha! Ahahahaha…! ♪
Absolutely astounding! That’s how you see it, huh? Interesting!
Mhm, mhm! It’s true, I can’t imagine you sticking to only one buddy, Chiaki-san.

Got youu…! ☆
Woohoo~! I caught one! ♪ Ehehe, we should be able to get enough food for my frogs at this rate!

Huh? You’re gonna keep going…? I’m feeling thirsty, so I wanna go home…

You’re thirsty? Then we’ll buy juice at the vending machine! It’ll be my treat! ☆

Ughhh… I’m telling you to let me go home already…

Ah! Midori-kun! A cricket just jumped over there!

Huh? Huh!? W-Where did it go…?

Don’t move! You may squash it if you do~!

Aaalright, Sengoku! I’ll help you out~♪

W-Wait… How long do I have to stand still…?
Hey, are you two listening…? Quit crawling on the ground, and just answer me, please…

Ahaha, you’re all having so much fun, huh?
Hmm, so there’s no need to stick to just one… Maybe I’ll go searching for a new buddy, then.
Anyway, you going home now, Anzu-san? If you will, I’ll take you back home again~♪
“I’ll be okay, it’s still the day time”… Oh, don’t be like that! Let me do the honor!
Huh? What’s with me all of a sudden?
The producer supports the idol, and the idol lives up to their producer’s expectations by shining bright!
It’s the perfect team-up! And a relationship suitable to call each other “buddy”, don’t you think? ☆
Hahaha! She refused! But Mama will keep saying it, anyway!
Oh, hey there! Don’t try to cover your ears and run away!
Now, come on! Let me take you back home today, Anzu-san~♪ Accept me as your buddy then, okay? ♪




Translation Notes
↑ Three-pointer is a shot done outside the three-point line in court.↑ Kamen Rider heroes typically work alone, whereas Super Sentai heroes (obviously) work as a team.↑ He says beppin (beautiful lady) to describe his motorbike, so I made him refer to it with she/her.↑ “Buddy” is in katakana (so basically, in English), which is likely why Chiaki couldn’t tell what Madara meant at first.↑ He literally says: I showed it to her while saying “Look, look! It’s a drone beetle~♪”. I couldn’t put it in the translation without it being awkward, so I figured I could note it down here since it’s cute.↑ A reference to the mascot character that appears in Pirate Festival. It’s also in his card for this gacha story.↑ In Japanese, kero is the sound a frog makes, so the mascot character’s name is based on that.↑ You can see Shinobu holding his frogs in his card.]]></content>

You’re rushing this way too much, li’l miss.
I get you. You get the urge to rush when you’ve got so many deadlines approachin’, yeah? Man, you’ve been picking up way too many jobs lately.
But y’know… You’re not used to making outfits yet, so you have to sew them properly, bit by bit.
If you hand in sloppily-made outfits to your customer, they could get upset and ask for a re-do.
It’ll only hurt you in the long run. Taking shortcuts is never an option.
I’ll try and help you out, alright? And if we really don’t make it, then we’ll negotiate with the customer, or just bow our heads down in apology.
So do it slow and steady, yeah?
…Woah. Why’re you leaning on my back?
Did you start feeling sleepy and lose focus?
Haha, so you’re feeling drained, and want me to spoil ya a li’l?
There there, it’ll be alright. You’ve been working really hard — You’ll surely be rewarded for it all one day.

Kiryu! Do you have a moment to spare? There’s something I want to show—
Wh—!?
W-What are you two doing!? Why are you so close to each other!? Incorrigible!

Haah? Don’t start thinkin’ up weird things, Danna. I was just helping the li’l miss with her sewing work, like I always do.
That’s why we have pillows on the floor. But then she started to feel tired, so she’s leaning on my back.

Is that so… Well, I suppose it wouldn’t turn into some romance if you two are the ones in question.
But you wouldn’t want anyone to get the wrong idea, so you should be more wary of the distance between you.

Yeah, got it. Anyway, what did you wanna show me? Have you got a new job for Akatsuki?

Ah, no… It’s not that big of a deal, I simply found a somewhat interesting manga.

A manga…? When you find something interesting, you always come and show it to me for some reason.
Are you my kid, or somethin’? Or maybe my wife?

What’s wrong with doing that… I’m the righteous, strict, arrogant student council vice president.
I don’t have anyone to casually talk to about manga. Just follow along, please.

Sure, why not. I was only helping the li’l miss out with her outfits — I don’t have anything else to do.
I’ll listen to you. I can keep working while talking, anyway.

Thanks. …Okay, then take a look at this.

Hm? Why’re you showin’ me your phone? Weren’t you gonna talk about manga?

The influence of e-books is huge lately, so you can read practically any manga on your phone too.
Sometimes I pretend to be doing important work on my phone, and read a few pages in between my Student Council duties.

Haha, what a naughty vice president you are. Maybe I should tattle on you to the student council members, eh? I’ll tell ‘em, “Look over here~! The vice president’s slacking off!” ♪

Please don’t.
…Transfer student, you may as well have a look, too. You get all excited talking to Isara about manga, don’t you? I assume you know and enjoy quite a few.
I’ve been busy lately, so I haven’t been able to keep up with any, even the popular ones. I&#39;m not familiar with this one either, but… I’m expecting you to know something about it.

Hm? C’mon, show us.

Hm, I should’ve brought my tablet — It would’ve been easier to show you on a bigger screen.

It’s all good. I can still read it like this.
But it is small enough to be kinda unclear… My face is gonna look scary if I start squinting my eyes.

Your face is always like that, though.
Come closer, transfer student. There’s no need to be reserved.
Right… I’ll skip ahead, and show you the scene in question.

In question…? What’re you talking about? Aren’t you showin’ us an interesting manga you found?

Yeah, there’s that, too. But I wouldn’t come and show you just for that.
I want to talk to you about this because if it goes down the wrong path, it could end in chaos.

“Chaos,” he says… It’s just a manga… I don’t get it.
Hm, lemme see… “Big Hit! The New Sensation ★ Romcom in an Academy! ‘Answer &amp; Masters’, or ‘Ansters’ for short”…?[1]

Ahahahaha! How does it feel to be drenched wet, hm!?[2] So this is the so-called “Handsome man, dripping with water”![3]

………

I’ve waited for this moment! For three whole years! I’ve waited for this mere second, when you would put your trust in me and let your guard down…!


…Heh. For the first time ever, you deserve actual praise.
My friend. These three years have been hell for you, haven’t they? Three years of pretending to love your wretched foe… to serve by his side, and treat him kindly and closely.
There was no need for such a plan — I would have been fine being killed by you.

…!! There you go again, talking to me like you know it all! Like you’re above it all! Please stop sitting there and allowing me to do this, Libra!
You&#39;re only bluffing, anyway! Pretending that, even if you’ve lost the battle, your feelings haven’t wavered or died, aren’t you? But too bad for you, because your dreams are ending right here, right now!
My friend, you’re aware of my power, aren’t you? That’s right! I can manipulate every single drop of water!
But manipulating pure water combined from hydrogen and oxygen isn’t all I can do!
I can even control other liquids! And I’d like to mention that every material in this world can turn to liquid!
Even those glasses of yours — The ones holding the key to your power…!
They’re made of glass, correct? Or perhaps reinforced plastic? It matters not! I’ll be able to manipulate it with my power!
I’ll melt it down to a muddled mess — along with everything else you hold dear to your heart…!

Heh…

W-What’s so funny!?

No, it’s just… you’re acting so cocky because you “won,” but unfortunately for you, I’ve already accomplished my goal.
Now that I’ve distracted you, she will have enough time to escape.
Hm… I’ve become a much more kind being. Or perhaps I’ve grown weaker…

…Why didn’t you bestow that kindness to us a whole three years ago!?
Whatever, it doesn’t matter anymore! Perish before you spread even more grief to this world!
It’s time to say goodbye! Aqua Punisher…![4]

………

…What do you think, Kiryu? You too, transfer student. Tell me your thoughts, if that’s alright.

No, I really just… don’t know what to say to this.
You gotta let me read from the start… I’ve no idea how to feel if I jump right into the middle of it.
I don’t have a single clue who they even are, or why they’re fighting.
Also, why does this guy who looks like you have flowers behind him constantly?

That’s how he is in the story.
Ansters is usually read through the eyes of the female protagonist, and the point of the story is to enjoy romances with a countless number of handsome men.
Like this man, who suffered the atrocity of his glasses being melted…
His name’s Libra, and he’s a senior the protagonist looks up to, so he always gets depicted with flowers fluttering around him.
I don’t see it often with the recent stuff, but it’s common in shoujo manga.

I don’t get it at all… And anyway, he looks like a typical Japanese person, so why’s he Libra… What’s with the wildly random name?

I think they’re using the zodiac for names. Like, look — The guy who looks like Shinkai is called Aquarius.

Mmm… Nothing’s makin’ sense. So this is, uh… “interesting”?

It is. Since it updates pretty regularly, there tends to be some plot holes, and sometimes it feels rushed with its conclusions… But its premise is promising, so it’s fun to read in its own way. It’s perfect for killing time.
Most of the readers aren’t really hoping for something revolutionary, or something that’ll stay in their mind forever, anyway. They’re fine with being entertained in the moment.
That’s why it’s pretty popular.
The art is consistently good, so there’s talk on forums that it could be a professional artist drawing it in their free time.
If that really is the case, then you should be able to tell through their art style, but… Pros can switch between styles if they put in the effort. Only experts would be able to tell their real identities.
The artist remains unknown. I tried searching for info using their pen name, but there’s nothing written about them anywhere.
So there’s also talk discussing how strange it is that they came out of nowhere.
They’re probably hiding who they are for certain reasons…
I mean, lately new artists improve very early on, probably because of the wide range of art tools available… They could simply be an art student before their debut as a professional artist.

Correct Answer and Authors 3
Haha, you’re discussing this in some serious depth. You start to sound like an otaku[5] sometimes, Danna.

“Otaku” is a compliment.

Oh, okay… But something’s botherin’ me. This manga’s using real people and places as reference, right?
I’m guessing you call this part of the drawing the background…? I’m sure I’ve seen this scenery before. Isn’t it the park near the school?
I sometimes jog around the school’s neighborhood as warm-up for my club, so I’d know.
But eh… Nowadays, you could find all kinds of backgrounds if you searched online.
Did they draw this scenery using that place as a reference? You can’t even say it’s a coincidence — they’re pretty much identical. It really is that park.
Look here — You can tell ‘cause of that structure it has.

Yeah, someone already pointed it out online; it’s definitely that park.
But it doesn’t seem like they referenced photos they found online.
I didn’t find any photos like this, at least… Though I suppose they could’ve been deleted by that point.
I’m guessing the artist came to the park themselves, and took photos to use as reference.

Oh? Which means they live close by. Feels like we’re detectives right now — We sound a li’l too full of ourselves, but I dunno, I’m startin’ to have fun with this.

Yeah. For now, we could say that I’m Holmes and you’re Watson.
Anyhow. Anyone can enter a park, so it wouldn’t matter if it was only here, but—
The real problem is that some backgrounds are based on areas within Yumenosaki Academy.
High schools aren’t like universities — only authorized people are allowed to enter.
And we’re a private school, so if anyone broke that rule, they’d be trespassing on our property.
That said, we do have live shows where we invite guests in.
At those times, we have hired hands who’re allowed to enter the premises to prepare for the event.

Hm. We can’t narrow down the suspec— I mean, figure out who the artist could be with this.

Yeah. I do want to try and narrow down the possibilities, but we just don’t have enough info at the moment.
We’re talking backgrounds based on places within the school’s idol course — an area that’s meant to be strictly monitored by default.
They’ve even managed to draw some heavily based on the restrooms, the Student Council office… Any fatal area you could think of.
If an outsider really has managed to enter the school, and then draw those places in their manga… that would be an extremely urgent problem.

Nah, let’s think about this more logically… Doesn’t this mean they’re someone from the idol course?
They’d be able to get in the bathrooms and the Student Council office easily if they were, yeah?

That’s true. I’m considering that to be the likeliest possibility.
After all, most of the characters in this “Ansters” are based off of students from the idol course.
Of course, there’s also the fact that many students working as idols have websites with their profile pictures attached.
You could easily use those as reference were you to search for them.

Haha… It’s a li’l creepy to think that someone’s being drawn in a manga without their knowing.

Agreed. It’s even violating people’s personal rights[6] — some characters are depicted very negatively, which is essentially defamation.
For example, a character who looked like you appeared for a moment.
He was depicted as a serial killer who absolutely loves brutally murdering people in cold blood.

…Who the hell is this artist.

C-Calm down, Kiryu. Your face is looking scary. We’re already trying to look for clues, remember?
We need to find them one way or another, and express our discontent.
This may just be a coincidence, but… The characters who are based on Eichi, Aoba, and those two who transferred to other schools — Tomoe and Ran… They have a lot of scenes where they fight the characters who look like the Five Oddballs.
This particular scene is just a nonsensical battle involving superpowers, but… There’s one part in it that unfolds the same way as one of our plans did back then.
Let’s say this manga really is based on idols who were involved in those incidents and this school, and was simply drawn as a parody for laughs…
If that’s true, then fine.
But there’s also the possibility that they’ve been planning to gain popularity, then choose the perfect moment to publicly expose what we did back then…
In other words, it’s likely that it was created to be a satire, or a work which criticizes those actions.

Ohh? So basically, this could be someone we crushed in the past… and now they’re out for revenge.

Yes, but I could just be paranoid. We’ve got a shadowy side to us… So maybe I’m being unnecessarily distrustful and anxious over this.
However. If this “Ansters” really is about criticizing our revolution of the past…
There’s no harm in creating things, but we can’t allow them to keep publishing a work like this.
We’ll pin down the artist, and negotiate with them. If push comes to shove, we’ll issue them a warning to never harm our school’s reputation again.
I don’t feel right censoring all of this, but the artist has been basing characters off of real people without their consent, so… We&#39;re justified in asking them to stop for that reason, as well.
After all, this is still breaching various laws — Even if they aren’t actually trying to criticize and expose our past.

Correct Answer and Authors 4
Hmm… This manga just feels sort of a waste. I skimmed through some more pages while you were talking, and it’s genuinely interesting.

Right? I’m pretty fond of it myself.
Its worldbuilding is fantastical, but sometimes the story shifts focus to their daily lives, where all they do is play a game similar to word chain.
Which makes literally no use of its setting, but is really fun to read.
You can tell that the artist is having fun drawing it as they like.
But that’s exactly why I’d rather they draw an original manga that would be viable in the industry. Otherwise, it’s only a waste of their skill.
No, not only that— They deserve something better than drawing a manga created only for the sake of criticism and personal grudges towards us.
There’s no denying it — the things we’ve done are unworthy of praise. Akatsuki were villains of the revolution that happened a year ago.
But that story has ended.
The involved parties may not be able to think of it as something “just in the past”… But personally, I couldn’t bear to see our bright, shining dreams get ruined, or become twisted.
I want to find the artist, and talk it out. If they really do detest us, then they’re free to beat us up until they’re satisfied.
But after burying the past as “history,” along with all the grief and vile discord between different parties… we&#39;ve entered a new era of Yumenosaki Academy.
I don’t want anyone digging up the past and exposing it just for the sake of causing turmoil within the school — not after everything’s already been said and done. I apologize in advance, but I’ll be plucking any sprouts that could cause disaster.

Alright. Though maybe you’re just being paranoid, like you said.
The artist might not have had any of those intentions — They might’ve just felt like it’d be interesting, and made the story without thinking.

Yeah… At first I enjoyed reading it, myself… Then I felt bad for considering taking a beloved work away from its fans, so I had intended to let it slide.
But… Once I started to doubt the true intent behind it, I couldn’t stop fretting.
I want to meet with the artist, just in case.
If they show no signs of the motives I’d presumed, then I’ll just mention that I’m a fan, and ask for their autograph.
Regardless, I will ask them to stop including the characters that are based off of real people.
I can’t do anything about that part — It’s still violating laws. They’ll have to give it up.

Hmm… This’ll be pretty tricky to accomplish.
There’s a lotta students in this school, especially if you count the other courses. We’re gettin’ nowhere &#39;til we shorten our list of suspects.
We aren’t even sure they are a student of this school, either. We just think there’s a good chance they are.

That’s true, but it’s impossible for an unauthorized person to enter the idol course’s premises.
There would’ve been a commotion were someone to spot an intruder, but unfortunately, I’ve noticed nothing of the sort.
And back in spring, we had that terrorist warning — or, well… we had a small incident, so they’ve tightened security since then.[7]
Unauthorized people can no longer enter the school so effortlessly.

Ahh, uhh. Yeah, there was that… warning.

Hm? Did I ever talk to you about it…?
Point is. This is what I came to you for — I want you to thoroughly read as much as you can of Ansters, and find any hints of who the artist could be.
People can’t draw things they don’t know — or at least, it’s not an easy task.
Assuming that a person did the research to draw something, you&#39;d still be able to identify who they were by figuring out how they obtained their information.
Kiryu, you’re not entirely familiar with manga, so you may have a hard time just reading through the story…
But I’m expecting answers from you, transfer student. Feel free to mention anything you pick up from the story.
Though… in reality, this isn’t our job.
If we really don’t manage to find anything, I’ll hire a detective with my own money. So don’t stress yourself over it; just tell me any of your thoughts.
…Hm? What’s wrong, transfer student? Why the sad look?
“What, and here I thought the artist was Mizuhanome-sensei”…?
Rid your memory of that name. How incorrigible.

Mizuhanome…?

Forget about it. …This “Ansters” is full of crack jokes and parodies — It’s entirely different from Mizuhanome-sensei’s style.
My work— I mean, their work was much more simplistic and rough-looking.[8]
No— shoddy is what they were. You need skill and ideas to write a parody, and this artist possesses just the right amount of technique and experience for it.
That’s exactly why I want them to write a proper, respectable manga.

…Hm?

What’s wrong, Kiryu? Did you pick up a hint while reading?

No, I hear footsteps—
Woah—!


please save me, mr. [red ogre]~!

…Shinkai? What do you need me for all of a sudden?

“Save me”…? Don’t tell me you got yourself involved with a battle of superpowers just like in this story…!?

Haha, you’ve been reading way too much manga, Danna.

    A few minutes later…

Guh— The storm’s beyond intense — I keep losing my footing.
I’d known there would be a typhoon coming, but this soon?
Dammit… I got so wrapped up in my discussion with Kiryu and the transfer student that I didn’t realize.

i do not think it has [reached] here yet~ it is simply nearing closer.
this year’s [typhoon] looks to be [enormously] strong.
fortunately, it will eventually [pass through] this area… and then hopefully [veer] away from the [japanese islands].
but it is tricky. this is a [natural phenomenon], after all… it is futile for us either way.
we cannot [intervene] with the way it works. we can only pray.

What? I can’t hear you through the strong wind — It’s bad enough that you talk in obscure ways.
Although… You do try to communicate with people now, so you’re already better than how you used to be.
…Woah—!!


wah—? are you alright, [temple guy]?
you tumbled down… the wind is [strong], so you [have] to be careful, okay~?
shall i help you with a “pain, pain go away”?[9]

…I do not need that. How incorrigible.

This isn’t the time to chat. C’mon, grab my hand and stand back up, Danna.

Don’t worry about me, I can get back up on my own. We need to hurry and deal with the matter at hand.

yes, i would like that very much… i really [cannot] do it alone. please help me save [that child].

Who do you even mean by “that child”?
You said someone was close to falling from the rooftop, so we rushed over… But I don’t see anyone up here.

Don’t tell me he already fell…!?

no. can you see them? the rain is harsh, so it is not easy to [see]… but they seem to be on the [edge] of falling.
we will have to pull them up, so please help me… mr. [red ogre].
you excel at manual labor, yes? my [hands] will be slippery from the rain, so i cannot pull them up with my [strength] only…

Aren’t you stronger than you seem? Hell, we wouldn’t even know which of us would win if we had an arm wrestling match.

yes. that is why i hope the [two] of us will be able to pull them up.

Hold on, I’ll also help. Someone’s about to jump off… right? Then I can persuade him to halt.
I’m not as physically strong as you two, but these sorts of tasks are my area of expertise.

Haha, nah. I don’t think we’ll be needing that from what I can tell. Just cheer for us, Danna.

Hm? Ah— The “child” dangling from the rooftop is… that?
I must’ve broken my glasses when I fell. All I see is a surfboard.

that’s right, they are a surfboard~ kaoru always keeps them lying on the [rooftop].

I’m well aware of that. I kept telling him off for storing his personal belongings within school without permission, but he wouldn’t listen.
It was vexing, but I ended up registering his surfboard as equipment belonging to the Marine Life Club, and designated the rooftop as the storage area.
He finds procedures like that bothersome, so I did it all for him instead. It’s my job to settle things without any complications.

yes, kaoru was very [grateful] for that. he is a shy person, so i do not think he would directly [tell] you so.
you are a good person… [temple guy].

Compliments won’t get you anything from me. Things are just different from back then — I have enough flexibility now to take proportionate measures for each situation.
I became stronger, gained more authority, and acquired more clearance to work in a multitude of areas.
No, not just that. I struggled and did everything I could to finally reach this point. All so I could have this much freedom.
It wasn’t so that I could sit back and bask in my own power. It was all to become capable of accomplishing the things I wanted to do.

as living creatures, doing such things is [natural]. we were simply used as [prey] for such purposes.
it is sorrowful, but that is how it [goes]. it is the natural [law].[10]
but… if possible, please choose a much [kinder] method next time.
please settle the issue before any blood can be spilled — before anyone can die.

…I’m working as hard as I can every day for that purpose.

Hey, enough chatting — let’s get a move on, Shinkai. The surfboard’s this close to being blown down.

ah, yes. [they] would break if they fell, and kaoru would be sad… so we will pull them up some way or another.
it is best to have as few sorrowful things as possible.
if that is what you people [think] as well, then there is no reason for us to [hate] each other.
let’s allow the past to flow away with the [water], and do what we can right now.

Haha, man. We’re completely drenched.

Hmm. The transfer student is still at the dojo, so I’ll contact her to prepare a change of clothes for us.
I think you still have some sample outfits in there, so.

Yeah, using those is fine by me. Let’s get outta here — The rain’s just gettin’ worse.

Alright. …You come with us too, Shinkai.

……♪

Hmph. You’re so strange — Why’re you so happy with that surfboard…
It’s merely an object belonging to your friend. It’s his fault for leaving it to rot instead of securing it when a typhoon was coming.
You could’ve just pretended you didn’t notice it falling.


no, no~ a hero would never turn his [eyes] away.
i am also a member of ryuseitai, so i will [save] as much as i can.
it is only for selfish reasons, though. both kaoru and chiaki will surely praise me for it. and i… will be [satisfied] with just that.

please excuse meee~♪

Yeah, come on in. I’ll get you a towel, so dry off. You’ll catch a cold otherwise.

i [prefer] to be drenched wet, though~♪

Hold it! Don’t walk on the tatami mat in that state, Shinkai. In this season, it could grow mold if we aren’t careful with it.

Haha, the dojo’s been waterproofed for whatever reason, so it should be fine.
I heard there was a time it was crumblin’ down, and they did some extra touch-ups during reconstruction.

Ohh, really… Hm, for a place that goes so far back, it does feel brand new.
Anyhow. Transfer student, it’s really late by now, so I’ll be taking you back home.
The typhoon’s only getting closer by the minute. You need to go home while you still can.
As for us, we can stay in school overnight if it really gets bad. As long as we contact our homes beforehand, it should be fine.
…Except you, Shinkai. I assume there’d be a commotion if you didn’t go home soon.

yes, i think so~ they do not really [like] the idea of me sleeping [away] from home.
it is already bad enough that i have been getting scolded for doing things that are “not like me” lately…
is it not [like] me to act this way? i do not know myself… what do you think, [temple guy]?

Don’t ask me such a difficult question. “Like oneself” and “like a human” aren’t things you can calculate. They’re vague concepts.
The majority of the world — in other words, oneself — will have to go through conflict after conflict until you find an answer that satisfies you.

Did you get that idea from my brother, Kei-chan?

…!? Where did you emerge from, Sakuma’s little brother!?

Do not call me that. I’m not his accessory, ‘kay?
Anyways. I was sleeping outside like I always do, but suddenly it was pouring rain…
So I tried to get to shelter as fast as I could, but every single door around was shut.
I was stuck until Anzu noticed me and showed me inside the dojo. It saved my butt~ Vampires just can&#39;t come in unless invited.
And well, then she dried me up with a towel, and gave me a change of clothes…
I started to feel at ease again, so I took a short nap.
I heard the place where I live is completely flooded, so I can’t go back home. I plan to sleep here tonight instead.
Vampires can’t cross running water, so yeah… Wait, I don’t need to explain this in detail to you, Kei-chan. Or do I?

Don’t call me that. People are going to think we’re close or something. Incorrigible.

Eh~? Aren’t we, though~? You and Anija may have quarreled and split up, but it’s got nothing to do with me~
If we act all buddy-buddy together, Anija’ll feel awkward about it, which would be most delightful~♪

You’re truly ill-natured… So you haven’t changed either. If you keep being mean to your brother, it’s just going to come off as affection instead.

rei’s [little brotheeer]~! good evening! act all [buddy-buddy] with me, too~♪

Ughh— I can’t deal with this person… Don’t hug me when you’re drenched wet, I do not find that delightful, okay!?

Haha. I dunno what’s goin’ on, but it’s gotten real lively here.
I think you guys’ll be fine together, so I’ll take li’l miss back home. Try to get along in the meantime.
It’s not so easy to “allow the past to flow away with the water,” but… The possibility’ll remain as long as you’re alive, so, well… Let’s all work hard with whatever we can.
Right then. Let’s go, li’l miss. Hold onto my arm so you don’t get blown away by the wind.

………

Hm? Why’re you starin’ at me, Shinkai? Did you wanna take her home instead?

(Right now, it’s really calm outside for some strange reason, but who knows when the rainstorm will come back again… Relocating isn’t a viable option at the moment.)
(I want to let our clothes dry off too, so the only option is to stay here and pass time…)
(But I just don’t have any common topic to discuss with them. If I really had to pick something, I suppose I could get things moving using embarrassing stories of “Sakuma-san”, but…)
(If I start talking about him, we might end up on some stories of the past that I don’t really want anyone bringing up… Mmm, what do I do… This is so incorrigible.)
(I mean, I don’t have to force myself to talk with them, and I don’t think either of them are the type to dread silence…)
(But I personally can’t handle this… This isn&#39;t some Buddhist memorial service; it&#39;s only wasting precious time to stay quiet when there&#39;s three people gathered here.)
(Hm… Oh, right. I may as well mention that while I can.)
…Hey, do you like manga?

fwah—? where did this come from, [temple guy]?

Manga…? Maa~kun adores them, so I’m trying to read some and learn to like them myself. But why&#39;re you suddenly asking that, Kei-chan?

Well, you see, things happened… And so recently, I’ve been reading a manga called “Ansters”.
I’m at a dead end with this issue, so that’s why I’m asking you two as well. Do either of you have any idea who the artist could be?

mmm~ i have never read manga before, so no.

…What do you mean you’ve never read manga!? Are you even Japanese…!?

huh? is that bad? when i try to read a [book] in general, it gets [soaked] for some reason, so i could not read it even if i wanted to.
after all, [books] are [impossible] to read once they are wet, yes?

That’s because you’re always soaking wet for some reason. Don’t take it so far with your enigmatic acts — You’ll cause trouble to everyone around you…
And anyway, if you want to read books, then there’s plenty of different ways to do it.
There’s waterproof books made for reading in the bathtub, and if you’re reading an e-book, you could always put a plastic cover over your device and read that way.

well, i do not want to read that much…
hmm, it really is a [strange story], though.
so there is someone out there drawing a manga [based] on us?
i am a little curious. if it is all right with you, please let me try reading that [manga].

Alright, I’ll place my phone on the floor. Tell me when you’ve read the page, and I’ll turn it to the next one. You come closer too, Sakuma’s little brother. We’ll read it together.

Ugh~ It’s already hot enough, and now you’re telling me to huddle close to two other guys…?

fufu, these kinds of things are sort of [fun] for me, though… waah~ this is such pretty [art].
hm, so how do i read this? am i meant to follow the line of words? it is a little difficult…
wow, so this is a [manga]…♪

You… Have you been living deep in the mountains without ever conversing with anyone?

no~ i live in the [ocean], as you already know. you are the one who lives in the [mountains], yes?

It’s more like I’ve come down from the mountains, and now intend to live a non-religious life.

ooh, so there is that sort of [system] over there. as for me, i have been a [god] from the moment i was born, and will be one until the day i die.

Haha, that’s pretty similar to my family. That must be what let you get close to my brother, huh…
Hm? Hmm…?
Hey, could this be the character that’s based on me?

Yeah, I think it is. There’s a different character that’s based on your brother, so.
The one that’s swinging a knife around everywhere and laughing maniacally must be you.

…Why did I get turned into this bratty delinquent. Pisses me off.
I should’ve been given something more like a prince or princess role, where I get to live happily ever after with Maa~kun.

There’s no point telling me that. It seems that this artist thought up their own personality based off of how you look.
You barely show yourself at the front, and you don’t answer any interviews either.
There’s not enough information about you out there, so it seems like you’ve been turned into a random, irrelevant character.

Mmm, if they’re so unsure what to do with those cases, then they could’ve just not added me into the story.
I don’t wanna be this kinda character… Why is he even licking the knife? Is he trying to get some iron inside of him?

Heheh. If you don’t want to be misunderstood, and have people think up their own version of your personality…
Then appear at the front of the stage more often, and show the audience how you truly want to be seen.
Don’t just keep sleeping; work some more.
You too, Shinkai. One of you sleeps everywhere, and the other bathes in water… Your eccentric acts are frequent, so people could easily misinterpret you. You should be more careful.

Correct Answer and Authors 8
Moving on. This manga tries to avoid having characters with overlapping personalities…
For example, Kiryu has a terrifying delinquent look to him, so his character is depicted with emphasis on a violent nature.
Like it or not, each character seems heavily influenced by the way they look over anything else.
Eichi’s depicted as a perfect, virtuous, beautiful, royal noble, and your brother is portrayed as an evil, mighty demon king with monsters for servants.

That’s completely different from my impression of them…
Mmm… This artist doesn’t really care about us, do they? They don’t sound like they know us very well.

That’s how I feel too. Yet, for some strange reason, the backgrounds drawn are exactly the same as our school’s.
Even areas that can only be accessed by authorized people, such as students or teachers, are drawn with elaborate detail.
If they have access to these areas, then they should be able to find out the way we behave in private, as well.
Although, if that were true, they wouldn’t depict any of us in these nonsensical ways.

Hmm… Maybe they aren’t from school, and they’re drawing this based on information given by someone else.
So like, the one with the info and the one drawing the manga are two different people.

Ahh, so you mean there may be an accomplice.
I didn’t think of that. Incredible… You’ve inherited that quick thinking from your brother.

I’m not smart ‘cause of my brother, ‘kay?
Anyway, I think the one who gathered all this info must have done it in several intervals, when no one else was in school.
I feel like the manga’s based on a previous version of the school.
Our school goes through changes constantly, yeah?
Like, old facilities getting demolished or remodelled, or areas that were barely used being opened again.
But all that new stuff isn’t in this manga. I skimmed through the whole story, and it’s been the same exact set of backgrounds.
It’s possible that the artist drew these chapters in a short amount of time, or maybe they didn’t bother to adjust the backgrounds to the new changes…
We won’t be able to know if either are true without asking them firsthand, but…
The things the characters say seem similar to recent interviews, so it’s kinda weird that it’s only the backgrounds that aren’t up-to-date.

ah, you are right. what chiaki said in the [manga] is exactly the same as what he said in an [interview] the other day.
the artist really is doing their [research].
if that is true, then they would try to be much more precise, and make sure their [story] was accurate to the current reality, wouldn’t they?
yet, the [characters] are written in a bizarre way.

Huh, your thoughts are very useful. I see… I’m starting to get a better understanding of who this artist could be, and how all this information was obtained.
Of course, these are still all assumptions.
Maybe this really is too much for me to handle…
I thought I might be able to settle this issue on my own, but I’m starting to feel like it’d be a lot better if I left it to the police instead.

…? what do you mean?

This isn’t the result of a personal grudge against us… but rather, it may be related to some business scheme.
Of course, I still need to investigate a little further before I’m fully convinced it’s as such.
This manga’s such a shame, honestly… The artist clearly has talent… and it’s an interesting story, but it just had to be related to some foolish scheme. How incorrigible.

……?

Yo, I’m back.
…What’re you guys doing? Why’re you huddled so close to each other?

Ah, Kiryu, welcome back. We were just… I figured it would be a good icebreaker, so I suggested we read that manga.
Anyhow, you came back really quickly, Kiryu.
If I remember correctly, the transfer student’s home isn’t that far away, but the rainstorm was so harsh… I thought you’d take longer.

Oh yeah, about that. It was really weird — Both the rain and storm just came to a stop on our way there.
We were able to get there easily. I think we just so happened to be at the eye of the typhoon.

fufufu~♪ i see~ i am [glad] to know it went well.

…? What’s up? Why’re you so happy about it?

you see, i made a small [request] for the [typhoon] to go far away. i [prayed], and [offered] a dance in return…♪

Ahh, you were dancing with that fan for a while.

Oh? So you turned the typhoon away. Thanks, Shinkai. It really helped me out.
If the storm had kept going like that, even I would’ve blown away.

Hmph, there’s no reason to thank him, Kiryu.
Humans can’t stop a natural phenomenon — Shinkai’s prayer has nothing to do with the weather changing.
This isn’t some manga — You have to separate reality from wild dreams.

I know, but he prayed for our sake. Of course I’d be happy about that, that’s why I’m thankin’ him.

fufu. there is no need to thank me at all…
as i have said before, this is [repayment] for [helping] me save the surfboard.
it is wonderful to repay [kindness] with [kindness], and [gratitude] with [gratitude].
that is why — while we do not live in a [manga] — i wish for the [world] to work that way.
i will alwaaays be praying for that.

Epilogue

    Location: Dojo



    One week later…

Hup— Haa—! Toryaa—!!

……~♪

…Hey. Your staring’s been botherin’ me. Have you got somethin’ to do here, Shinkai?

no, not at all~ i am watching how you [move], so i can use it as [reference] for action moves.
we often do [acts] that require fighting lately, you see.
i am still not used to it, so… i have to study more.

Ahh, Ryuseitai’s always doing hero shows, yeah…
So you’re trying to learn a few fighting skills for that, huh?
Haha, isn’t that great — you’re actually thinkin’ to put in effort and learn.
Until recently, you always seemed like you had no interest in anything at all.

yes. because i was disinterested~
i simply watched it all float by, as if it was a [story] of a distant world… just like a [manga].
but, doing that was [wrong], and i realized how lonely it was… that is why i have been working hard lately.

That so? Great, I’m cheerin’ you on. You two really are childhood friends, huh… Mikejima said the same thing once.

…i have no motivation to do anything all of a sudden.

What, why? Really though, I do think you two are similar…

Excuse me. Do you have time, Kiryu?

Yo. What’s up? Did you find another interesting manga?

hello, [temple guy]~♪

Heyo, Kei-chan~♪

Woah, what the—!?
Why are you lying on the floor — I was this close to stepping on you…
Kiryu’s currently in the middle of his club activities. Stop getting in his way, you two.

I’m not, though.
We slept over together on the day there was a typhoon, right? It was pretty cozy, so… I’ve been sleeping here nowadays.
The whole academy’s been bustling with activity, especially indoors… I’ve been wanting another place where I can sleep easily.
Heheh. I’m gonna make this my campsite from now on~♪

No, just go home and sleep there.
For goodness’ sake… Didn’t I tell you to moderate your eccentric acts? Incorrigible.

fufu. i’m sorry, was i a bother?

Nah, not one bit. There aren’t many members in the Karate Club, so no one uses this place when there aren’t any activities going on.
You could make this a sleeping spot or a hang out spot — Wouldn’t bother anyone.

Don’t spoil the troublemakers, Kiryu.
Anyhow, I’m here to inform you about what happened to that Ansters manga.
I doubt you’re worried over it, but I feel it’s my responsibility to tell you.

Oh yeah, that manga. What happened to it in the end?

Yeah, well, the exact details are vague, but… I did the appropriate procedures and reported the issue, figured out who the artist is, and negotiated with them.
I still feel bad about it, but the manga will be put to a stop.
However, as I had guessed, the artist had no ill intentions, so no further actions were necessary. The issue was settled with a negotiation only.

Ahaha, you’re pretty soft yourself, Kei-chan.

fufu, and yet that sort of person was able to be so [cruel] towards us…
it is almost strange, or rather, it really was a sorrowful [era], wasn’t it?
but anyway. who was the artist? i am a little curious.

Right. I won’t disclose their identity, as it would be shameful for them… They’re an average artist who has talent, but are still far from reaching fame.
Nevertheless, they’re a professional, and anyone who knows manga well enough would be surprised to find out who it really was.
They’ve got absolutely nothing to do with Yumenosaki Academy, and live far away from here.
However, they were able to exchange information through the internet, so that never hindered their drawing progress.
Apparently, they were commissioned to draw Ansters by someone. For an extraordinary amount of money, mind you… I can’t begin to comprehend for what purpose.
According to the artist, the commissioner told them to focus on making the manga gain popularity and recognition.
And so, they became engrossed with drawing the manga, and put all their effort into it — that’s all.
Authorities also conducted an investigation, and there wasn’t anything fishy about them.
They came over with a box of confectioneries to apologize, and well… They were such a humble, good-hearted person. They immediately accepted their mistake, and apologized for everything. I almost felt sorry for it all.

Hm. So the real mastermind here wasn’t the artist, but the commissioner.
What on earth were they trying to do… And who even were they?

I’ve no clue. They used a disposable email to contact the artist, and the payment was done through a fake name.
They’re a professional in these things… Authorities are still investigating for more information, but it seems like they’re at a loss for who it could be.
Apparently, it could be related to Cosmic Production, or a related enterprise.

cos…mic…?

It’s an idol agency that’s been gaining power lately.
This matter was probably one of their schemes to eliminate this academy, as we still have our place in the business world.
This is only what I presume, but… With the manga increasing in popularity—
They could then show negative depictions of Yumenosaki Academy, as if such things were the truth, all to bring bad reputation to our name, and to make us lose fans…
Or they could expose the truth of what we’ve done, and ruin our reputation…
I could go on with many different tactics. It’s similar to past revolutions, where books were used to spread demagogy, and create certain images of certain people.
In this current era of Japan, you could say those “books” were the manga.
How wretched… I know this is common knowledge, but manga is meant to help you have a nice, fun time.
Thankfully, we were able to shut this down before it caused a disaster, but I think there’s other similar tactics being used all over the place.
We need to be extra careful. In order to avoid having our reality — our story — be destroyed freely.

Gotcha. Let’s get rid of this useless scheme, and draw the story we wish for… Mizuhanome-sensei~♪

…………
…Hold it. Kiryu, why did you call me by that name?

Haha. Y’see, that day there was a typhoon, li’l miss and I talked about a bunch of things while I took her home.
I got curious about that name she mentioned, so I tried to ask her about it.
She seems to be a big fan of Mizuhanome-sensei.
At first, she didn’t answer me out of respect for you, but once she opened her mouth, it all spilled out.
I got to learn a lot more about you thanks to that, though. You should let me read your work sometime.
I bet I would enjoy it way more than some goofy manga with weird ideas about us.

Just forget it. All of it…
Curse you, transfer student… I kept telling you never to tell anyone…

Oh? What’s this? What’re you guys on about? I smell a great story~♪

mizuhanome… i know of her. she is the water goddess, yes?

Arghh, you’re all so noisy! Don’t get involved!
This discussion is over! I’m going back to the student council office — Thanks to this unnecessary mess, I’ve had a lot of work piled up!
I’ve no time to chat over manga! My hands are full just trying to live my own life!




Translation Notes
↑ In Japanese, Ensemble Stars is あんさんぶるスターズ (ansanburu sutaazu), so Answer &amp; Masters is written as アンサー＆ますた～ず (Ansaa &amp; masutaazu). It sounds similar to the original, but switches the hiragana and katakana around (あんスタ for Enstars and アンすた for Ansters, both pronounced as ansuta). Thankfully, a similar difference is shown in English with “Ansters” (The e and a switched around). Also, the story’s title “Correct Answer and Authors” is meant to be a parallel to the name.↑ Aquarius speaks in kanji and hiragana, unlike Kanata. Libra speaks similarly to Keito.↑ In Japanese, mizu mo shitataru ii otoko means a super handsome man, but there’s also a wordplay that it’s a handsome man dripping with water.↑ Aquarius says 深海煉獄殺, which is romanized as “Aqua punisher”. The kanji would be deep sea depths - purgatory - murder.↑ Otaku, i.e the Japanese word equivalent to a (manga/anime/video game/etc.) nerd.↑ As in, it’s violating people’s image, especially without their consent.↑ A reference to what happened in Gang.↑ i.e 素朴 (pure and simple), and 硬派 (having a rough feel), whether art style-wise or story writing-wise. He’s sort of vague about it, probably to give leeway to interpret it as you like.↑ Saying itaino itaino tondeke is what parents usually say to their kids who got hurt, typically while patting the injury or kissing it. It’s cute, so here’s a video.↑ To put it simply: how animals live by eating other living things, but applied to humans as well.]]></content>

Content Warning: There are casual suicide mentions in this story.


    Season: Summer


    Location: Set Piece Storehouse


Heeeey!! Is there anyone out there~!?
Heeeyyy! Somebody~!

Ain’t there anybody out there~!? We’re trapped in here~! Anybody~!

…It’s no use… I don’t hear a single person outside… and we’ve been banging on this door and yelling this whole time, too…

Uughh… The set piece storehouse is in the back of ES, after all… I usually wouldn’t be ‘round here, either…

Siiiighh… What are we supposed to do…
(Ahh… How could this happen…?)


    Location: Cafe Cinnamon



    Two hours ago…

Alright, then sign here please… Thank you.
Well then, I’ll be going now. Please order from Takamine’s Greengrocer again…♪
(Whew. I think I’ve delivered everything…?)
(I have to check through the sale slips first. My mom’ll be so mad if I miss anyone… I really don’t wanna go through that.)
(Ermm… so we have the teishoku place[1] in Saison Avenue, ES’s Cafe COCHI, the staff cafeteria, and… Cafe Cinnamon.)[2]
(Mhm, that’s definitely all of them.)
(Delivering to only four places may not sound like much, but I had to carry a lot of vegetables to each place since they serve so many customers a day…)
(It used to be really easy to deliver stuff since I did all of it in the shopping district, but that started to have problems of its own…)
(A while back, I tried to deliver around the district, but then people started to gather around me… and it turned into a whole mess…)
(Life gets really annoying the more well-known you become… I don’t even wanna stand out…)
(Well, it’s not too bad though, since our shop’s thriving ‘cause of it…)
(I guess you’d call this a first world problem…?)
(Well anyway, I have to keep succeeding in as many jobs as I can, no matter what—)
(There’s not much I can do about this “problem” of mine, so I’ll try not to think about it for now…)
Alright, what should I do now? I’ve got some free time, so… hmm…
(I’ve got dance practice to go to later, and I was planning to head to it after I was done delivering—)
Ah! Actually, I may as well go to Season Avenue while I can and look around for some new mascot character goods…♪
(—Ahh, never mind. I just realized none of the shops are even open at this hour…)
(And even if I did find something I like, I wouldn’t be able to buy it… My allowance is really short this month… so depressing.)
(Actually— Isn’t it too weird how I work a huge ton as a greengrocer and as an idol, yet I’ve only gotten a thousand yen raise since last year…?)
(My mom just decided on this amount without ever letting me have a say in it, saying that it’d be enough for a second year high school student, and I just kinda went with it…)
(Well, on the brighter side, none of this has been affecting any of my jobs at the moment, since I’ve been using L$ for any Ryuseitai expenses, and getting money from my parents whenever I need it…)
But I wish I was paid enough money to buy an extra large plushie without going broke… I really wanna be soothed…
Uuu… The more I think about everything, the more depressing it gets…
Ugh. Just think about something else for now… I need to think of somewhere I can go kill some time.
Uurmm…? There’s all kinds of places like that in ES, but I dunno, I don’t feel up for it…
(Everyone’s working really hard day in and out, and I feel like that’ll make me restless… Like, I dunno, it’s not the best place to go to for relaxation…)
(So another place I could go to is—)
…Hm, okay. It should still be cool outside right now, so I’ll have a small walk around the ES building.
I feel calm whenever I look at plants, and it won’t cost me a penny… It’s just perfect…♪


    Location: ES (Exterior)


(Breathes in and out) Haah… phew…♪
Maybe I was right to go with this idea… The air feels so nice… I haven’t had the time to take a stroll like this lately.
But man, it feels so good that I might end up forgetting all about my lessons, and I really hope that doesn’t happen…

Where’d ya gooo~!? I’m beggin’ ya, give it baaack~!

Hm? I heard a voice from afar… They sounded panicked, maybe I should go help…?
(Ugh, but I don’t wanna… I bet it’s gonna be yet another troublesome problem… But I think it’ll haunt me for the rest of the day if I ignore it…)
(Ahh, man… I used to be able to ignore every bothersome thing without a second thought…)
(But thanks to a certain someone, I now have something like a hero’s voice inside me, constantly poking me to not be that way…)
(I feel like his overbearing blood is consuming my body, and it makes me wanna die… It’d be a different story if it’s just learning from someone, but this is—… I really just don’t wanna be infected by that guy of all people.)
……Ah! I’m not supposed to be thinking to myself right now—
Um, okay. The green flame is the mark of compassion! The great nature, growing infinitely! Ryusei Green, Takamine Midori! — Alright then.
I’m on my way to you~ I’m not sure if I’ll be able to help, but please wait a little longer, okay~?

Content Warning: Casual drowning mention.


    Location: Forested Path


Hm… I think I heard it coming from here…?
Hmm? The person over there… is that Kagehira-senpai?

Ngahh~! Come on out already~! I’m beggin’ ya~!

Ummm…? Good morning, Kagehira-senpai. What’s going on here…?

Nngah! Midori-kun! Did ya come across Daikichi-kun anywhere!?

Ugh—You mean Akehoshi-senpai’s dog, right…? I’ve got bad memories of him…[3]

Ya too!? He’s drivin’ me crazy right now~!

Huh? Really?
Could it be that you’re thinking Itsuki-senpai turned into a dog…?
Oh, don’t worry. I can assure you that’s not what happened. Daikichi-kun is a real, genuine dog…♪

Oshisan turnin’ into a dog…? Ummm… What’re ya on ‘bout? Daikichi-kun’s obviously nothin’ but a dog, an’ people can’t turn into dogs either, so…?
Ahhh!! But at this rate, I bet he will get angry at me like a growlin’, menacin’ dog~!! What do I dooo~!?

(Huh? Did I jump to conclusions too fast…?)
(That’s so embarrassing… I wanna go drown myself in the sea…)
Ughh… I’m sorry. Please forget what I just said…
Um, so you’re looking for Daikichi-kun? What happened…?

Y’see… Daikichi-kun nabbed my ID ta enter the ES buildin’… an’ ya can’t enter without it, right? That’s why I’m lookin’ fer him~

Huh… Yeah, that’s definitely a problem. I heard that the procedure to reissue one is a real pain, and it takes forever to get a new one…

Exactly! That’s why Oshisan warned me not ta lose it when he handed mine over ta me!
I gotta get it back, or he’ll be super mad~! Uuu, what do I dooo… He’s totally gonna give me hell fer this…

Wha—He’d go that far…?
(Mmm… He really sounds like he’s in trouble…)
(It’s gonna be physically painful to search for one dog in such a huge place, though…)
(But I’m sure if Morisawa-senpai were here, he’d immediately help out without a second thought…)
(Sigh… Well, I’m here now, so I can’t pretend to be a bystander, or I’ll just feel bad for the rest of the day. I guess I’ll help out until it’s time for practice…?)
Um… If you don’t mind, I could help you find Daikichi-kun?

R-Really!? Yer alright with that!?

Yeah. I still have time before I need to go, and I was only strolling around to kill time.

T-Thank ya kindly~! Yer like my savior~!
Ah— But yer part of Ryuseitai, so I reckon ‘s completely natural for ya ta help people out… Was that rude fer me ta say?
Yer just what ya’d expect from a hero of justice~♪

Ahaha… I’m not that noble of a person, y’know…?
Ryuseitai has had joint lives with Valkyrie a few times before, and we’re indebted to you, so, yeah…
I can’t sit around here and do nothing while a colleague is in trouble, that’s all…
Thanking me for something like this would only make me feel awkward, so… Please don’t worry about it.
Anyway, let’s go search for Daikichi-kun before he gets any further.

Nnah, yer right! He dashed from the front of the ES building over t’here, so this is where I lost sight of ‘im.
Did he go far into the woods…?

I’m looking around, and I don’t see a uh, shadow? of a dog anywhere, so… I think you might be right…
How about we try calling for his name while walking further inside…?

Aight th—Wait! Midori-kun! Ain’t that a dog over there?

Ah, you’re right. It looks like one.
…Ahh, it ran even further inside.
That looked like Daikichi-kun, so let’s hurry after him…!


    Deeper into the forested path…

Daikichi-kuuun! I’m beggin’ ya, come on out~!

You’re stressing out Kagehira-senpai! You need to return his ID~! Daikichi-kuuun!
Sigh… He’s really nowhere to be found, huh?
This is the first time I’ve come this far down the path. Nobody walks this far inside, huh…
Ughh… The plants are so thick, it’s kinda creepy… and there’s barely anyone around… It’s kinda scary — I’m starting to feel anxious…
Wasn’t there a huge storehouse for keeping set pieces and props around here…?

Mhm, ‘s first time I’ve been here myself… I heard anythin’ hard ta store within the buildin’, like stuff used in photoshoots, gets stored in there.
I reckon they’ve been renovatin’ it since last week?

Huh? Really?

They’re gonna make it bigger or somethin’, an’ they’ll make a proper path from the back of ES for easier access ta it.
That might be why there’s barely anyone ‘round here.

Huh… I didn’t really check up on that. That means we need to catch Daikichi-kun and get out of here as soon as possible.

Ah! Ain’t that big buildin’ the storehouse we were talkin’ about?

—! Did you hear that bark just now…!?

Midori-kun! Ain’t that Daikichi-kun near the entrance ta the storehouse!?
—Ah, he’s goin’ inside. The door was left slightly open… That’s so careless of ‘em.

Oh, but this puts luck on our side…♪ He won’t have anywhere to escape, which means we’ve got ourselves a fish in a barrel—
—Wait, that doesn’t make much sense. He’s a dog, not a fish… Umm, then dog in a barrel?

Nnahh~! Never mind that~! We gotta get my ID before he escapes again!
I’m not lettin’ ya escape this time! Chaaarge~!

Ah—You don’t have to run…!
Ahh, jeez! Please wait, Kagehira-senpai! Don’t leave me alone here~!

Chapter 3

    Location: Set Piece Storehouse


Daikichi-kun— You’re not getting away this time!

Give it up an’ gimme back my—
Wawa—!? Midori-kun, don’t just stand at the door~ Couldja go in already~?
We’re both gettin’ wedged in the door~! Why’d ya charge at ‘im at the same time as me?

U-Um, it’s just that you were yelling “charge” at him, so I…
Wai—Kagehira-senpai, don’t push me, the door is too small…!
I’m way too big, I’ll get sandwiched by the door— Stop, stop…!
Waah~!? —Gah—ow!
Owow… I crashed straight into one of the setpieces…

Nnah! M-Midori-kun, ‘m so sorry…! I pushed ya way too hard… Did ya get hurt?

Oh, I’m alright. I’m pretty sturdy, so…
Actually, I’m more worried about the setpiece… I’m pretty huge, so I might’ve done something to it… I dunno what I’d do if it breaks… I don’t have the money to pay for it to be fixed…

I reckon it’s all good! I don’t see a scratch on it! It ain’t broken at a—
Mm? It’s kinda wobbly…? It keeps teeterin’ back and forth like it’s losing its balan—
Aaaaaaaah!? It’s fallin’ down~!

AAAAAAGH?!

…………

…………
(Cough, cough…) So much dust…
Ugh… I almost thought I died from the impact… I’m so lucky that they’re huge pieces without any real weight…
I gotta get out of here… Huff, huff…
There’s dust all over me… so depressing…
Ah—! What about Kagehira-senpai…!?
Aahhhh~! He’s buried inside…!
Are you alright, Kagehira-senpai!? I’ll lift the sets now, okay!?

I-I’m alri—Achoo! Haa-choo!
Nnaah~… The dust’s makin’ my nose tingly…

Heave-ho… I’ve got it up, so please come out of there now.

Thank ya kindly~♪ Huff… Ahhh~ That scared me… I’m so glad it wasn’t heavy…

Um… I’m so sorry. I ended up crashing into it because of how huge I am…

Huh!? Why’re ya apologizin’!? It’s all my fault, y’know!?
I’m sorry for puttin’ ya in danger by pushin’ ya… I’m so glad yer alright.

Huh? No, it’s my fault for—
Um, why do I feel like there won’t be an end to this…
Alright then, let’s consider it both our faults… Let’s be more careful from here on in. It’s really dark and messy in here, so…

Mhm, thank ya kindly, Midori-kun~♪

Ah, those setpieces blocked the entrance… They’re all pretty light, so we’ll just need to move them out of the way.
But maybe that’s a good thing? Daikichi-kun has no way of escaping now.
Let’s catch him and then move them out of the way.

Aight~ Ummm, is he all the way in the back? It’s real dark in here, so we gotta step carefully… Daikichi-kuuun?
Ah! He’s near the wall!
…Hm? Huh? I chased after ‘im here ‘cause I thought he was Daikichi-kun but… maybe I was wrong? It does look similar to ‘im, though.

Ah, you’re right. I couldn’t tell from afar… It’s thinner than Daikichi-kun, isn’t it? So it was a different dog all along… Maybe it got lost?

Ahh! It escaped through the little window over there!

Mm? But it dropped what it was holding…
Isn’t that your ID over there?

Waaah, yer right! What a relief~ Thank ya so much, really~♪

I didn’t really do anything except run around with you… I don’t think I was even useful in the end…
But I’m glad you found it…♪ Alright then, let’s go back. I should be heading for practice now, anyway—
Huh? Actually, what time is it anyway…?
(Umm, let me check on my phone… Oh, my phone’s almost out of battery. Did I not plug it in correctly last night…?)
(Oh well. I can charge it during practice, I just need to know the time right now—)
—! Ahhh!? It’s already this late!? Crap, I have to go now or I’ll be late!
Kagehira-senpai, let’s hurry back!

Y-Yeah! Let’s get these outta the way. I’ll lift it from ‘ere, so ya should take the other side.

Okay! Let’s do this~ One, two, three— Heave-ho…!
I think this’ll be enough for the door to open?

Mhm. It should be—
Mm? Mmm~!?

…? What’s wrong? I’m in a hurry, so… Could you please open the door already…?

…M-Midori-kun. W-What do I do… The door won’t budge…

Huh!? P-Please move aside for a moment. I’ll try opening it…!
Mmm~! Huff… Huff… Mmmrgh~!!!
…It won’t open. Maybe we’re supposed to pull it, not push…?
Nghhh~!!
Nope… It won’t budge… Why…?

D-Did… the impact from the pieces falling lock the door by accident somehow…?

Which means…

We’re…

Trapped in hereeeeeee!?

Chapter 4

    Back to the present…

Siiiighhh… This is so depressing…

L-L-L-Let’s just stay c-calm now, y’hear?!

You need to calm down more than I do… Take a slow, deep breath.

(Breathe in, breathe out)…
Ahh… Yeah, it really helped me calm down a li’l…♪
Yer amazin’, Midori-kun. How’re ya so calm? An’ I’m the senior between us, too… Real pathetic of me.

Oh, no, it’s more like… I get self-aware, I guess? I feel more calm when there’s someone else panicking.
By the way, do you have your phone on you? Could you call for help…?
I could use mine, but it’s almost dead… I don’t think it’ll survive long enough for a phone call…

—! Ahh, yer right! We could do that! I was so panicked, it totally slipped my mind~
I’ve got mine! Gimme a sec, I’ll ask Oshisan for help! ♪
Mm? Mmm? Huh!?

…? Kagehira-senpai, why’re you patting yourself all over?
You look like the penguin-mascot character “Pen-tagon”, it’s kinda cute…♪

…Um, Midori-kun. ‘m real, real sorry…
Y’see, I must’ve dropped my phone somewhere while runnin’ around…

Whaaa!? You dropped it!?

Nnaaaah~! I’m so stuuupid~! Why am I so unlucky today!? Is this meant to be the unluckiest day in my whole life…!?
Ngh, this is real pathetic of me… From now on, I’m “Kagehira Moron”! Moron, y’hear!

Calm down… There’s no point in crying over spilled milk, so don’t be so hard on yourself, okay…?
Sometimes it’s just one of those days… When everything goes wrong no matter what you do, and you keep tripping up no matter how careful you are… I have those days too, so I know how you feel…
And anyway, I still have my phone with me, so it’s alright. I don’t know how much longer it’ll hold, but I’ll try calling for help.

Uuu… Thank ya kindly, Midori-kun…

(Mmm… I think it’ll die while trying to call someone, so maybe I should send a message instead…?)
(I think they’ll be able to understand what’s going on if I send a message saying, “Kagehira-senpai is stuck with me in the set piece storehouse”…)
(Now it’s just deciding who to ask…)
(Ughh… A certain overbearing face keeps popping up… Go away.)
(Umm, maybe I’ll ask Tetora-kun… Ah, but he said he’s gonna be a little late to practice because he has a job to finish first.)
(Maybe Shinobu-kun then…? Mmm… But he mentioned something about playing around with encrypted messages—)
(He may think I’m just sending him one of those and end up not getting what I mean…)
(Then there’s Shinkai-senpai… It’s completely random if he’ll be around, which is anxiety-inducing to say the least…)
(So the last person left would be…)
Ahh, dammit— Why does he come to mind when I’m in trouble… Is it because he’s a hero? (mumble, mumble)

M-Midori-kun? Why’re ya mumblin’ ta yerself while typing…? Yer face’s scarin’ me…

Please don’t mind me. I just felt a rush of irritation well up inside me…
Umm… “Kagehira-senpai is stu—”
—Ah, crap! The battery’s gonna die! …Ahh, forget it, this’ll do! Go, send!
…aaand it’s dead. The message sent, right…?
But I couldn’t type the whole thing… Will he understand…? Actually, I wouldn’t mind if he comes over ‘cause of the message cutting off so strangely…
I can’t even manage something as simple as this… Sigh, I wanna die…

—! Don’t die, Midori-kun! Yer still so young! Yer parents’ll cry fer ya if ya do~!

Huh? Ahhh… I just have a habit of saying that… I don’t really mean it. Please don’t take it seriously…
Well, I guess it’s my own fault for constantly babbling on about depression and wanting to die…

Oh, fer real? That’s a relief, then.
Well, ya did what ya could. We just need ta believe in ‘im and wait…♪

That’s true… You’ve really calmed down now, huh? You were so panicked earlier…

Ahaha, yer right~ It’s like ya said; ya feel calmer when ya see another person bein’ all anxious.

Hehe, right…?
Anyway, what’ll we do now…? Should we find a place to sit?
We can’t sit on the floor since it’s so dusty… But this is a storehouse, so there must be something we can sit on.

Yeah. I see some chairs over there — let’s see if we can’t sit our butts down on ‘em.

Ummm? Ahhh, there’s a cover over them, but we should be able to sit on one if we take it off…♪
I’m pulling the cover off… Huh. This setpiece is way too fancy, it&#39;s actually kinda weird seeing it sit in a place like this.

Yer right. Aight, let’s wait here fer our rescue. Though we look kinda silly dilly dallyin’ while we’re trapped in ‘ere.

Hehe, true. But I wouldn’t wanna stay in a place like this for too long, so I really do hope someone comes to our rescue soon…
(Please, notice our SOS…)
(I don’t have that much hope in you, but I at least know you’re a hero who’ll come to the rescue, Morisawa-senpai…)

Chapter 5
He’s still not here…!

Huh? Ain’t ya askin’ fer too much? I reckon it’s only been five minutes, y’know?

Whaa… Only five…? Every minute feels like a century…
We’ve got nothing to do while we wait, so I keep having horrible thoughts, and it’s seriously depressing…
Doing something should keep my mind off all that, though…

Yeah, I get ya. So how’s about we explore the place?

Huh? This dirty storehouse…? I doubt there’s anything interesting, though.

Huh, ya think? But that’s what I like about it…
Hehe, maybe I’ve gotten used ta this place?
Being surrounded by all these huge setpieces makes me feel like a little doll — it’s kinda excitin’.

Ahhh, now that you mention it—
It’s cute how that Scandinavian house set looks like something you’d see from the Sylvanian Families.[4]
I think my anxiety’s fading away a little just looking at it…♪
Alright, sure. There’s not much else to do here, so let’s try exploring the place.

Aight, then how about we go deeper inside? I see a huuuge stage set from ‘ere.

Okay.


…Alrightie. Look, look, Midori-kun! This set looks like a huge dollhouse, it’s so cute~
This sofa also looks great, don’t it? It would suit Madonee perfectly…♪
I wonder what show they used it for…? ——Huh? Midori-kun?
Midori-kun, ya listenin’? ‘s lonely when I’m just talking t’myself, y’know…?

Uwaaaaaah…♪ It’s the legendary “Niku-nikumatan☆”[5] stage set~…♪
It was a show where you did stretching exercises with this bear mascot who loves building muscle—
But Niku-nikumatan☆ immediately pulled a muscle on the first episode, and it was never aired ever again! It’s like the show was just a dream! Uwaaaah…! I can’t believe it’s right before my very eyes~☆

Mmm? I don’t really get how that works…?

Exactly! He loves muscle building, yet he’s doing stretches on the show! And pulling a muscle during stretches makes absolutely no sense, which is just beyond perfection…!
—Um, huh?
Oh, I didn’t notice the other side because this set was hiding it, but… This looks like the restroom, huh…? There’s a kitchen, too — though it only has the basic stuff…

Ah, yer right. Maybe they’ve got ‘em here so it’s easy to fix up setpieces while yer inside the storehouse?

Looks like it. Guess we won’t have to worry about hurting our bladders or finding something to drink. We’re in a life-or-death situation now, so…

There’s all kinda big setpieces here, so there’re probably more hidden places all over…
Woah! This is huge… And I don’t get what it’s s’posed to be. Whaddaya use it fer…?

Mmm? I think this is that giant robot we had in front of the ES building for an event a while back… I think it’s the chest piece?
Morisawa-senpai went nuts over it and sent me a whole bunch of photos, so I sorta remember it…

Ahh! That robot, huh?
I wouldn’t have noticed unless ya told me. I couldn’t tell by the body parts alone since it’s so huge…
Wow, we really are like toy dolls right now, ain’t we?
From a doll&#39;s perspective, stuff belonging to human beings would be so big, ‘n they wouldn’t know what it’s fer—
I reckon they’d use a sofa for a trampoline and stuff.

Oh yeah, there was a nursery rhyme like that — where the toys come out to dance and play in the night behind the humans’ backs.[6]

Mhm. I used t’sing it ta my li’l siblings back in the day.
When I was a kid, I used ta dream of stuff like, “if I could be as small as a doll, I could eat lots and lots of cakes, and live in a fancy dollhouse~”.

Hehe, I used to think about being super tiny, too. I wanted to nap on the belly of a fluffy mascot character…♪
But in the end, I just got bigger and bigger… Sigh, so depressing…
Oh yeah, hasn’t enough time passed since I sent that message? I wish he’d notice the SOS and come rescue us already…

Yeah, hmmm… I still don’t hear anybody outside, though.

Ughh… Weren’t you supposed to be a hero to anyone in need…? You always stick your nose in my business even when I say no, so what gives…?
I know there’s that whole “a hero always arrives in the nick of time” saying, but can you not do that this time…?


    Location: ES (Exterior)


Mm… Where on earth is Takamine? It’s already time for practice… I think his phone is dead, because I can’t call him, either.
(I tried asking around, and it sounds like he was delivering vegetables early in the morning…)
(The manager of Cinnamon said that he finished his delivery over there, so I don’t think he’s still delivering anything…)
(I accidentally mentioned that I couldn’t find Takamine anywhere and made the manager worried… I feel bad.)
(I’ll have to let them know when I find Takamine that everything’s all right.)
On the other hand, Takamine sure is hardworking! He’s been properly going to school, doing his jobs, and even helping out his family’s greengrocer!
The manager also praised him a lot, and hearing it made me feel proud~♪
But if I said any of this to him, he might get angry at me again and tell me off for treating him like a kid… But I can’t help it! I’m so happy to hear my junior getting praise and recognition!
But really, where is he?
I got a message from him earlier saying, “Kagehira-senpai is stu”… What on earth does it mean…?
Oh! I shouldn’t just think to myself right now.
I’ve asked the other three to start practice without the two of us, but I’m still making them wait on us either way. I’ll think about the message while looking around!
A detective’s work involves using his feet! This is just like Space Sheriff Gavan — I’m all fired up~♪


    Location: Set Piece Storehouse


Ah, speaking of which — I’ve been curious about something…

Hm? What’s up?

I know this is a remote area, but isn’t it a little too weird how nobody has walked by here…?
If they’ve been renovating since last week, then you’d think there’d be someone around here by now…

Hm? Ain’t that exactly why there’s nobody around?

Huh? Haven’t they started the work since last week, though?
That would mean they’re still working on it, so shouldn’t a worker have shown up by now? Isn’t it weird that there isn’t anyone?
Like, I figured that even if Morisawa-senpai doesn’t come save us, we could bear it until tomorrow when a worker comes in here… Hence why I wasn’t really worried or anything…
But there really is just nobody around, huh…?

Nnaah! No, no! Ya got it all wrong, Midori-kun!
They may have started a week ago, but the actual construction with the machines an’ all is gonna start next week!
They’re just makin’ it off-limits to be ‘ere, is all. But that’s still counted as “under construction,” y’see?
So I doubt anyone would come by ‘til next week…

Whaaaaaat!? Why didn’t you tell me that earlier!?

Nnahh, sorry fer thinkin’ ya got what I meant… I knew alla that already, so my explanation was real lackin’…

That’s why you’ve been panicking this whole time!?
Uwaaaaah…!!! W-What do we doooo!? We can’t just wait for help…! We have to find a way to get out of here!
We’ll die if we wait a whole week… I can’t stand the thought of my usual phrase becoming real…

Chapter 6

Mmrgh~! M-Midori-kun, could ya go a li’l higher? Just a li’l more… Just another ten centimeters…!

You’re asking for too much… I’m stretching as far as I can…
Also, ten centimeters isn’t just “a little”… Please don’t underestimate how tall that’d make a person…

Nnaah~! The ceilin’ window strategy’s a flop after all…

Alright then, I’ll put you down. —Here we go…

…Phew. Ngh, it wasn’t enough… I was able ta open the window, but I can’t lift my body up ta it~
I must’ve been real heavy on yer shoulders, huh? ‘m sorry.

It’s alright. I’m always carrying heavy boxes of vegetables, so I’m used to the weight.
But you’re pretty light anyways, so I could probably even run while carrying you on my shoulders.

That’s good, then~
Ah! What if I stand on yer shoulders instead!? I should be able to reach then!

Um, I’ve been thinking, but… Let’s say you did manage to get out through the window… Wouldn’t you just immediately fall to the ground…? Do you have some sort of plan?

Umm…
Oh, yer right actually.
Ahaha, I hadn’t thought about what would happen after I got out~

Thought so…
Let’s forget about this idea. Things would only get worse if you hurt yourself.

Aight… That’s a shame.
We can’t get out from the bottom window the dog went through, so I figured this’d be our ticket outside…
I guess this means we need t’think up somethin’ else…?
Ah! There’s a vent over there, how ‘bout that?
Y’know, like ya see in spy movies? Where ya go through the vents~

We can’t. It’s as high up as the window, and it’s locked with wiring. There’s no way we could get it open normally.

That’s no good either, huh…

Mmm… Maybe if we could drop something outside as an SOS…

Somethin’ as an SOS…
Ah! Then how ‘bout we hang the words SOS outside the window with these here ropes?

With rope? We don’t have scissors or tape— How are we supposed to make the letters?

Well, y’see~ Ya link the letters like a single stroke… then ya tie it here, and—
There, if I keep doin’ this and then make it hangable, it’ll turn into an SOS sign~

Ohh, I get it! Wow, you really are a member of the Handicrafts club, huh?

Hmhm~♪ Ya can leave the thread kinda stuff ta me~ Though this is just rope…
Aight, I reckon I could hang it up if ya lift me one more time? My hands reached the window, so it should work.

There’s a lot of trees around here, so I dunno if anyone will notice, but… This is all we have right now. Let’s try it.


    Location: Forested Pathway


Mmm… He isn’t here, either…

Mmm… He isn’t here…

Hm? Did someone just say the same thing as me…?
Ohh! Aoba! Have you been looking for someone, too?

Oh, Chiaki-kun? Fancy seeing you here~ Yes, I have. You see, I spotted this on the ground earlier.

Hm? Is that a phone?

Yes. I didn’t know who it belonged to, so I had no choice but to peek in to know… It looks like it belongs to Mika-kun.
I figured he would need this back, so I’ve been looking for him, but — I can’t find him anywhere.

Oh? What a coincidence! I’m also looking for Takamine!
Oh yeah, that reminds me — Takamine’s message earlier mentioned Kagehira-kun’s name.

Message?

Takamine didn’t pick up the phone when I called him because his phone died, but before that, he managed to send me this. —Ah, here it is.

“Kagehira-senpai is stu”…? Is this all?
What a strange message… What could it mean?

I have no idea!
But my guess would be that he was trying to say “staple”!
The superhero staples are the basic foundation for all heroes of justice! Examples of them would be the storylines of Anpanman, Goranger, and Ultraman!
Ahh, but lately, tokusatsu shows are really starting to stray from those elements…
Well, never mind that.
In other words, Takamine is talking to Kagehira-kun about superhero staples, the shows that pop into your head when you think of them.
They might be playing pretend in one right now, so he wanted to message me saying he’ll be late…!
But gosh, he’s such a ditz — He sent me the message midway~☆

Mmm… Personally, I don’t think that’s what it is…
Also, if he meant staples, wouldn’t he have said “sta”, not “stu”?[7]

Mm~? Huh, you’re right… Then what could this message mean…?

Who knows…? But this may mean they’re both together right now.
But honestly, it’s strange that they disappeared just like that. Did they get spirited away?

S-Spirited away!? No, that’s impossible! People can’t be spirited away; there&#39;s no scientific evidence of it happening, so that&#39;s why I’m definitely, absolutely not scared by the thought of it!!

Really? But there’s folklore for every place you go, as well as cases of it happening, so I would assume it’s likely possible…?

No, really, there’s no way it could! We should stop talking about this, okay!? If we keep this conversation going, it may actually— Nono, it won’t happen, it won’t!!
C’mon now, let’s talk about something fun! Something as bright as the sun! …Maybe we could talk about the sun?

Ahaha, that does sound nice, but we should continue our conversation after we’ve found the two.

Ah! You’re right! We should accomplish our goal first!

Chapter 7

    Location: Set Piece Storehouse


Sigh… Nothing, huh…

Oh man… I looked ‘round the place again, but there really ain’t no other way ta get outta here.
Will we just be stuck ‘ere forever…?

…………

Nobody’s gonna be comin’ to our rescue after all…

Huh…?

Ah! I’m only gonna make ya anxious if I keep talkin’ like this, aren’t I? ‘m real sorry!

No, um… By that, do you—
…No, nothing.
(Did I disappoint him…?)
(I bet I did… There’s no way this could’ve gone well…)
(I mean, there’s still nobody coming to our rescue…)
(The more I grow up, the more I learn the hard truth… Nothing’s convenient in this world…)
……………
(Why won’t you come save us…?)
(Isn’t a hero supposed to always come to the rescue whenever there’s danger…?)
(I didn’t believe that at first…)
(But you’d always, always arrive on the scene — and you’d always, always, always, always be shouting as loud as you could…)
(And before I knew it, I started to think… maybe even believe, just a little, and yet—)
(It’s not that I thought you’d never lie, but…)
(I felt like… you wouldn’t let it be a lie. I really started to feel that way.)
(That was enough for me to keep working as hard as I could…)
(Because I didn’t wanna think that what those people said about us back then was true…)[8]
(And I didn’t wanna let all our hard work be a complete lie…)
(So why…? Why won’t you come…)
(…No. I’m already aware… I’m just taking it out on you.)
(I didn’t wanna accept the truth, and it’s been making my heart race like crazy…)
(Because what’s really making me mad… the one who’s really pathetic right now is—)
…………

Midori-kun? Why’re ya crouchin’…?
Ya must be real anxious… ‘m sorry. If I just didn’t run straight inta this place without a second thought, you wouldn’t be stuck here…
I’m sure someone’ll find our SOS, so don’t be so down, aight?

…No. —That’s not it.
I’m… I’m sorry, Kagehira-senpai.

Huh!? What’s wrong!? Why’re ya apologizin’ outta nowhere!? It’s my fault that yer here, so I’m the one who’s supposed ta say sorry!

No, not that… It’s just, you’ve been thinking up so many ways to get out of here, and all I’ve done so far is reject each and every one of them…
And like, I haven’t even bothered to come up with anything on my own.
I’ve just been waiting for someone else to come save us… When I’m the one who’s supposed to save you…
Ryuseitai—and everyone around me, they do that all the time, yet I can barely do the same…
When we were called hypocrites and frauds… I was so angry that someone who didn’t even know a thing about us was telling us off…
But in reality, I actually can’t do anything — all I ever do is vent my frustrations…

……

All I ever do is whine, like I’m doing now… I even told Morisawa-senpai not to show an uncool side to us, like an arrogant idiot…[9]
But in the end, I’m the one who’s the really uncool, pathetic loser…

Woop! (Claps his hands as hard as he can)

Eeeeek!!
Y-You surprised me…! Please don’t make a loud sound like that… The echo in this place is insane…
Also, I was being serious here, y’know…?

Ahaha, ‘m sorry. I figured it’s best ta start with clearin’ the mood in here.
Being locked in a dark place really starts ta make ya feel like yer down in the dumps, don’t it?
I dunno how yer feeling, but—
Is it really that bad ta be uncool?
Would that mean that kids can’t become heroes just ‘cause they can’t do what the heroes on the screen do?
Y’see, where I used ta live… Whenever we used ta watch Super Sentai shows, all my li’l bros would start sayin’ they wanted ta be heroes.
Does that mean they can’t become one?

…………

I don’t see it that way. They may jus’ be kids now, but… as long as they believe, hope, and do their best—
Some day, they’ll go from bein’ my li’l bros to bein’ heroes, y’know?
I don’t ever wanna reject kids who have that hope in themselves. I wanna cheer for ‘em. Just like how I was cheered on—
Y’know, ‘m sure heroes and idols are the same kinda thing.
As long as ya believe and wish fer it, yer path ta yer goal will get clearer ‘n’ clearer — but that path’ll stop short if ya don’t believe in yerself.

…Is it really alright that I can’t do anything right now? Is it really fine to be this pathetic…?

Even the heroes on screen don’t win every battle in a cool way, y’know?
There’ll always be a time when they get into trouble, get close to losin’ — and get beaten ta the ground…
But they always get right back up, and that’s what makes ‘em so cool. That’s just another reason why kids admire ‘em so much.
That’s why yer not even a li’l pathetic right now, Midori-kun.
Yer just workin’ yer way back up! And besides, yer savin’ me a whole bunch!
Ya helped me find my ID, and the anxiety woulda been overwhelming if I were stuck in this place all alone!
Y’know what? Nothin’ spells “hero” more than someone who isn’t even aware of just how much they’ve been savin’ people~♪

…Then please say all of that without surprising me…
Gosh… Thanks to that shock you gave me—all my moping just flew right out of me.

Chapter 8
Aight then, let’s get back ta thinkin’ up ways ta get outta ‘ere!

Kagehira-senpai, let’s try throwing ourselves against the door to break it open.

Whaaa!? Where’d that insane idea come from!?
I doubt that’ll work…? I mean, it’s made outta iron…
—Wait, yer stretching already!?

We don’t have to make a hole in the door or anything — all we need to do is bend it open a little. It should be manageable with two guys.
I mean, it would be great if we actually did manage to break it open — but also, someone might hear our banging at least.
Besides, it may be made out of iron, but it doesn’t seem to be that thick. Or else it would’ve been so heavy, you wouldn’t even be able to open the door.
Not only is dust going to get in our faces, but it’s also gonna hurt, and we’re gonna have to hope we don’t get injured… Honestly, I don’t actually wanna do this, but—
We’re not gonna be falling straight out a window at least, so I figured I could try my best for this.
But we’ll stop if either of us get close to an injury, okay? There’s no point in acting cool here.

Ahaha, ya sound so much more confident now.
Aight then. Let’s try it~!


    Location: Forested Pathway



    Deep into the path…

Uu… The woods are so quiet, it’s a little unsettling…

You’re right. And there’s renovation going on right now, so it’s even quieter than usual.

Are Takamine and Kagehira-kun really over here…?

Who knows? We checked the entire area and couldn’t find them, and this is the only place left, so maybe they’ll be here…?

Oh! There’s a large building over there! The rusted exterior makes it look so eerie…

Ahh, that’s the set piece storehouse. It’s the building they’re going to renovate.
Hm? There’s rope hanging out the window…?

Ah! You’re right!
Umm… “202”…? What does that mean?

I don’t have a clue… The first thing that comes to mind is an apartment room number…

An apartment room number? Here? We don’t have a room by that number in ES, either… Maybe it’s a phone number? Like the number you call in an emergency.

I don’t think there’s a telephone number for 202, though…

What a mystery… Mmm…?
—! Huh? Something’s starting to come to me when I tilt my head…

Me, too… There was a similar trick in the mystery novel I read…
If you read it diagonally… no, in the opposite direction…?

Opposite direction… “es-oh-es”…?
Ohhh! Flip it around, and it becomes “es-oh-es”!

Ah, that’s it! They call it mirrored writing~ How interesting, it’s like a visual illusion~♪

…SOS!?

W-What’s going on!? Why is there a request for help outside the storehouse!?

Chiaki-kun, about the message you received earlier…
That “stu-” part… maybe it was meant to say “stuck”?[10]

So that means… What Takamine wanted to say was—
“Kagehira-kun is stuck with me in the set piece storehouse”!?


    Location: Set Piece Storehouse


Alright then, we’ll charge on the count of three.

Aight!

One—

Takamineeeeee!!

Mika-kun, are you okaaaaaayyy!?

Gaaaaaaaaaaah!?

Are you alright!? Are either of you hurt anywhere!?

Huh? M-Morisawa-senpai…?

T-Tsumuchan-senpai…? Why’re ya…?

Ahh, I’m so glad you’re safe…
We were looking for you two. I found your phone, so I wanted to return it to you.
Then I spotted Chiaki-kun looking for Takamine-kun, so we tried working together.
That’s when we saw the SOS sign outside the window and rushed over to help.

Ah! Ya found my phone!? Thank ya kindly~!

Wait—Forget that, how’d you two unlock the door!? Did you have the key or something!?

Hm? Key? There wasn’t a lock or anything, though?

Huh? B-But, we couldn’t open it no matter how hard we pushed or pulled…!

Ummm…? It’s a sliding door, y’know? Look—It opens when you slide it.

Hm, yeah, I don’t think pushing or pulling it would work on this door.

Wha…

A-Ahaha…
We were so panicked, we never considered the possibility of it bein’ a sliding door…

…I’m depressed and wanna die. Do not search for me, please.

Ha ha ha!! ☆ Don’t be that way, Takamine! You two are safe, and that’s all that matters!
Don’t worry about it! We all have days when we fail — that’s what makes us human! Failures are the key to success!
If you’re a boy, then leap forth with full confidence! Jump out and reach for your future! ☆

Shut up. Don’t you dare say “failure” again.
Sighhhhhh… What the hell, so it was all just a big waste of time… I’m so depreeessed…
…Well, it wasn’t entirely a waste… But, still, I just… (mumble, mumble)

Ehehe, a lot happened, but ‘m glad we’re out now. Thank ya kindly, really~♪

Thank you too, Kagehira-senpai…♪

Oh? I didn’t think you two would be so calm after being stuck here… Did something good happen?

It’s a secret~ Ya gotta protect a hero’s secret~♪

(This sure was a mess… Oh well. At least something good came out of it.)

Ah, I almost forgot! The other three are waiting for us in the practice room!
Takamine! Our comrades are waiting for your return! Let’s return at the speed of a shooting star!

…………

Hm? No response!? What’s wrong, what’s up!?

(He’s the same old overbearing Morisawa-senpai, right…?)
(My eyes must’ve tricked me for a moment. It was pretty dark in there… and out of nowhere, it suddenly got really bright…)
(I’m sure that’s the real reason why Morisawa-senpai and Aoba-senpai looked like heroes…)
—He’ll only get more overbearing if I say that out loud, so I’ll keep it to myself.

Did you say something, Takamine?

Nope.
Yeah, you’re right. That’s enough darkness for one day. Let’s go somewhere brighter.

(Sigh… I’m sooo depressed… I wanna die…)
(Everything feels so exhausting… Both physically and mentally… I want something soothing… Like Anzu-san’s mascot characters, or Master Artist’s drawings… Or even a calming event where you get to play with small animals…)
(How does everyone put up with this exhaustion…)
(They’re all just doing whatever interests them, so maybe they don’t have to worry about it so much…)
(I still can’t completely reach that mindset… I need some kind of reward…)
(Well… I’m starting to enjoy doing things with Ryuseitai… But it uses up all of my energy and willpower…)
(I don’t have the motivation to do anything else afterwards… So I end up putting off all the annoying stuff I don’t wanna do by telling myself I’ll do it tomorrow…)
(Then that day comes and I wonder why I didn’t work on it just a little bit every day… That’s the situation I’m in right now…)
(Ughhh… I was supposed to carry a bunch of vegetables to the school’s cafeteria every day… But I started skipping out on it &#39;cause it’s such a pain, and my parents got mad at me for it…)
(Now I have to spend half of my entire day just carrying all the boxes of vegetables that piled up…)
(And it has to be on my day off, too… I was hoping I could lie around inside with the heater on all day….)
(Ehhh… Complaining won’t get me anywhere, though… And if I put it off any longer, my brother might offer to do it for me… I have to get this done on my own somehow…)
(Just three more trips should probably be enough for today…)


(…Hm? I think I hear some drumming sounds from the gym…)
(I’m pretty sure the Basketball Club has today off, though…)
(Hmm…? Am I remembering things wrong…? Maybe I should double-check when I’m done, just in case…)
(Since Morisawa-senpai gets really annoying when I skip out on the club…)


    Location: Gym


(Hmm…? Huh? There’s no one here…)
(But I thought I heard some dribbling going on a second ago…)
(Did I just imagine it…? I mean, that kinda sound lingers in your ears…)
(Hrrnn… But there’s a ball and a uniform lying on the floor for some reason…)
(Someone must have been doing some solo practice ‘til a second ago…)
(Hmmm… The number on the uniform is four… Which means this is Morisawa-senpai’s, I guess… But he’s not really the type to just go home without tidying up after himself…)
(Maybe he just went to the bathroom…?)
…Eeek!!
Wha—Huh? What just…? A-A dog?
(A dog just came right out of the uniform!?)
Eeek…! W-What’s with this dog…? Don’t come near me…
I’m fine with fictional mascots, but real dogs are alive and can move around—I don’t know how to deal with them…!!
Don’t mooove… Don’t get cuddly with me, I’m not your owner…
(What do I do now…? And whose dog is this… I feel like I’ve seen it before… Maybe I should check for a collar…)
Eeek!! I’m sorry, did I tickle you? Please don’t make a weird noise…
(Ughh… Now that I think about it, I’ve been seeing a lot of dogs around school…)
(I kinda remember an announcement saying not to feed the dogs, &#39;cause if it gets any worse than it already is, they’ll have to get rid of them by calling over the health department…)
(Sengoku-kun said something like that in one of the lunchtime broadcasts…)
(Eeee!!)
W-What is it, doggie…? You’ve got something in your mouth…… Are you… giving that to me…?
Ooooh~ Getting a gift from a small animal makes me feel like I’m in a fairytale~♪
Hmm… This is some student’s notebook… Their handwriting is all cluttered and doesn’t stay on the lines… Whose is this…?
Wha—This is Morisawa-senpai’s notebook…?
(Umm, what…? Why did it give this to me… Now it’s looking at me with a straight face for some reason…)
(I-Is it trying to tell me something…?)
Ummm… Are you telling me to give this notebook to its rightful owner…?
Eeek—I-I’m wrong? Don’t bark, okay…?
(I don’t get what it’s trying to tell me… It’s starting to hit its paws on the photo of Morisawa-senpai…)
(Yeah yeah, get ‘im~ Punch him real good~♪)
(No wait, this isn’t the time… It really is trying to tell me something…)
(I know stuff about plants and vegetables, but I don’t really know what an animal could be saying…)

Chapter 2
(Hm… The doggie slipped into Morisawa-senpai’s uniform and started playing with the ball… Looks like it’s having fun…)
(It kinda reminds me of someone I know… Wait—Could it be…?)
Um… I honestly doubt it, but… are you Senpai…?
Ahhh—! Please don’t bark! Was that a “yes”…?
No way… That kind of magic doesn’t exist in real life… Then again, a book I borrowed from the library had a story like that…
But… Ehhh…? Ughh… I guess it could exist…?
Um… Tell me if I’m right, okay…?
Morisawa-senpai, did you transform into a dog…?


Hey! What are you doing here!?

—Eeeeee!?

There are going to be exam students here for a meeting this afternoon, so the gym is off-limits!
If you’re here to help out with preparations then be my guest, but if you’re not, then leave immediately! Otherwise, you’ll only be getting in the way!

Ah—Uuu…?

Hm? Is that you, Takamine? You’re from Ryuseitai, right? What’s wrong? Why are you just standing there? Where’s your captain, Morisawa?

U-Um… I—Uh…
(W-w-w-what do I do!? The Vice President is here…! I’m scared!!)
(I’m pretty good about following the rules, so thankfully I don’t ever come face-to-face with him, but… He gets super angry at any first years who break the rules…)
(Seeing people get angry makes me anxious…)
(We did talk a little during Scroll of the Elements, but it’s still hard for me to interact with him…)
(Ughh… I gotta get out of here before something bad happens…)

…? What are you hiding in your clothes?

Huh? Uh, um, nothing…?
(Crap… I just stuffed doggie-senpai into my cardigan without thinking…)
(It’s struggling around for air… The Vice President is gonna get suspicious…)
Umm, I ate way too much and gained weight! So, uh, my belly’s gotten bigger…! That’s all!

…You’re going to get sick if you don’t take better care of your health.
Well, it doesn’t matter. You’re an honest kid, and you didn’t really do anything wrong, so just put the ball back in its place along with the uniform and go home.

Y-Yes! Understood…!

…By the way, this has nothing to do with anything… But since the meeting is coming up soon, the health department is coming over to seize any stray dog that’s around the school.
We don’t want those dogs near our visitors, after all.
If the department gets hold of them, they’ll probably be euthanized.
There’s a member in your club who owns a dog, right? Probably leaves him around without a collar…
So if you find his dog, keep it safe. Otherwise it’ll be swept away with the rest.

(Wha…? The health department is coming…? No, this is awful timing! They’ll euthanize doggie-senpai if they find him…!?)
(That’s just too much…… I have to save him…)
E-Excuse me! I’m going home now!


Ah—Hold it! Hey!! You didn’t clean up after yourself!!

I-I’m not the one who left them lying around…! Please excuse me, sorry!!

Huff… Huff… That was exhausting… It feels like it’s been ages since I ran that hard…
(I think I should be fine here… He wouldn’t chase after me, right…?)
(T-That was a ridiculously heroic rescue scene just now… And I didn’t even save a heroine or anything, it was just a dog… This whole situation’s so weird…… Ughhh, what am I gonna do now…?)
Hm…? What’s wrong, doggie-senpai…?
You sound like you’re whining… Are you… worried about me…?
You’re always like this… Even though you’re the one who should be feeling weird here, after turning… transforming…? into a dog…
You’re always, always worrying and fussing over other people all the time…
That’s why I think it’d be terrible if something bad happened to you… Um, like… I can’t put it in words well, but… It just wouldn’t be fair…

Chapter 3
It’ll be okay… I’ll do something about this, so don’t worry… For now, I’ll keep you safe at my house until the health department’s gone…
I’ll also ask Shinkai-senpai or Anzu-san for some help… Shinkai-senpai seems like he’d be pretty good with weird stuff like this…
I’ll do something about this and turn you back to normal…


Back to your silly, peaceful daily life…
So don’t look so anxious… Everything will be okay… There, there…♪
Eee—Ahaha… Please don’t lick me just &#39;cause you’re a dog now… The moment I remember it’s actually you in there, it starts to feel really gross…♪
Hehe, I’m feeling hungry after running all the way here… It’s noon by now, so it’s time for some lunch anyway…
You’ll have eggplants for lunch, Morisawa-senpai… Just kidding~♪
I’m kidding, I’m kidding… You hate eggplants, after all…
(…? Huh…? Doggie-senpai is happily sniffing the eggplant… and licking it…?)
(That’s weird… He always freezes up at the sight of eggplants…)
(Maybe turning into a dog made his taste buds change…? Hrrmmm…? I feel like I might have made a huge misunderstanding right from the start…)

Yooo, Takamin! Yahoo, yahoo, yahoo~! ☆

Aaah!! Huh!? Akehoshi-senpai…?
Welcome~ Are you here to buy something for lunch?
There’s some good corn that just came in today…♪

Ahhh, no no! Takamin, you took care of Daikichi for me, right?
The Vice Prez said something like that at the gym!

Huh…?

Ah, there you are, Daikichi! Come over here~! Your owner’s here to pick you up~♪

Daikichi… Ahh, that was the name of your pet dog, wasn’t it…? So he’s yours, then…?

Yep! His name’s Daikichi! It’s a good name with a good omen to it!
Wait, have you never seen him before?

Sigh… Um, so this dog really isn’t Morisawa-senpai…?

…? Why’re you bringing up Chi~chan-senpai? I don’t get what you mean, but this here’s Daikichi!
We were raised together like brothers, so his interests are the same as mine. Whenever I’m practicing basketball, he comes over to play with the ball!
But his paws are usually dirty from the mud, soo~ He left footprints everywhere in the gym.
The place looked really bad, so I had to go and get the mop and dust cloth!
By the time I got back, I heard you’d taken him away, so I had to come all the way here for him!

B-But he had Morisawa-senpai’s notebook and uniform for some reason…

Ahh, he was also practicing with me! Actually, we’ve been there together since this morning!
Daikichi had Chi~chan-senpai’s uniform in his mouth when you saw him, right?
He’s a clever dog, so he tends to bring back stuff to its owner~
Takamin, you smell like Chi~chan-senpai, so he must’ve thought it was yours.

I smell like that guy…? N-no……

Well, don’t you? Since he’s always hugging you!
A dog’s sense of smell is two million times stronger than a human’s… Wait, or was it just twenty thousand? Well, basically he can identify even the faintest smell!
Anyway! Chi~chan-senpai’s mopping up the gym right now, and I wanna go help him, so could I have Daikichi back? The health department’s coming soon, so I gotta take him home.
……Thanks for taking care of Daikichi, Takamin. Actually no, you saved him~♪

No, I didn’t really do anything… I just misunderstood what was going on and started running all around for no reason…
Gahh, I feel like a dumbass… This is so embarrassing, I just wanna die already…
Eh, Wha—? What is it, umm… Daikichi-kun, I think? Please don’t rub against me…

Ahaha~ Daikichi’s also saying thank you~♪

No, no… There’s not really anything to thank me for…
Well, whatever… I did something really embarrassing, but… it would’ve been awful if he was taken away and euthanized…
In the end, nothing bad happened, and that’s what’s most important… No, actually… The most important thing is peace…♪

    Location: Hallway, Second Floor


(Hah… It’s gotten so late already. It’s completely pitch-black outside, as well.
If I don’t hurry home, the Young Master will be upset.
Recently, the Master and Mistress have been away quite often.
The Young Master likes to put up a strong front, for some strange reason. And as a result of that, despite his own loneliness, he hasn’t had the opportunity to allow himself to be pampered by his sister, or the servants.
Well, it is not as if I can place the blame for his behavior on the Master, though.
The strengthening of the Himemiya family’s foundations is necessary, while the Young Master takes his detour from his responsibilities and aims to be an idol.
When the day comes that the Young Master is the head of the Himemiyas, once he returns to his original path… he will be able to begin his life again, from that point of high standing.
The Master’s actions are out of concern for that goal. By no means, is their absence a result of some hatred towards the Young Master.
As far as I can tell, the Young Master is aiming to be an idol with a surprisingly unordinary amount of passion, though…
It is possible that this detour will lead to the place where he finally settles, I suppose.
An idol and the head of the Himemiya family; there is a possibility that he will come to embrace both roles.
In that case, there would be no loss in improving the status of the Himemiya family.
You are truly wonderful, Master. Being able to look ahead, towards the future, and taking action in accordance with it… The family’s status has not reached these heights simply because of luck, after all.
…Hm?)
Please forgive me. Whoever is hiding in the corner of the hallway over there, do you have some business with me?

Eek!?
H-how did y’know I was here… Yukkun?

‘Yukkun’? Ah… is that you, Kagehira-sama?

Yeah… I’ll come out now, so please don’t do anything t’me.

I have no intention of doing anything to you, though…
Why are you so frightened? We are classmates, are we not? ♪

Nnah~… Well, I don’ really get why, but y’ seemed kinda scary, Yukkun. It felt like somethin’ cold was slitherin’ up my spine, or somethin’.

Fufu. Have I become duller, I wonder? Or, are you especially sharp, Kagehira-sama… at sensing danger, I mean.
Regardless. What are you doing here, staying at school so late into the night?

Aren’t we both here super late, though? I was doin’ my school part-time jobs like I always do, but after everythin’ was done I got tuckered out and fell asleep, I think?
When I woke up, it was this late… Nnah~, Oshi-san will be mad that I’m gettin’ home this late.

Haha, you do often doze off in the middle of class, Kagehira-sama. You seem to be wearing yourself out, so please take care.

Mm, thanks a lot. Anyways, it’s ‘cause we don’t have a lotta money for funding Valkyrie activities.
Well, compared t’doing lives, school part-time jobs are like a drop’n’the bucket as far as money goes.
But still, we need funds t’put on lives in the first place. Like they say, even a pile of trash becomes a somethin’-somethin’, y’know.[1]
Anyways. I’m glad I met y’here, Yukkun. It’s so dark, it’s kinda scary… If a security guard found me, they’d probably be mad, I think, so that’s why I’ve been pacin’ in the corner here.
If it’s no problem with you, d’you wanna walk with me out to the school gates?

Hm… Alright, very well. Let us be off, then.

Okay! Ehehe~ Yukkun, you’re really kind, huh?
You always clean up the classroom when it gets all dirty, and you always are lookin’ out for anyone who seems t’be in bad shape… Always made me think you were a real nice person. ♪

Do I truly appear that way? That is an honor. ♪
…Have I been behaving as a proper butler would, I wonder?

Mhm! Well, I don’t know any other butlers, so I can’t really say.
Whoops. We shouldn’t be chattin’, huh? Let’s head home.

Yes. I think the school gates are typically closed by now, so let us collect our shoes from the racks at the front of the building, and leave out another exit.
It seems we’ll have to take a detour. Yumenosaki Academy is in the process of strengthening its security, so it would be quite the troublesome situation if we were found by someone patrolling.
Rather than just receiving a drawn-out lecture, we might be punished instead.
If we both were to be suspended, it would cause quite the issue for our units, would it not?

Nnah, that would be bad! I’m already a burden to Valkyrie, as it is! If I caused a problem, then Oshi-san would definitely throw me away!

Fufu. No one is going to throw you away or pick you back up, you’re not a dog.

I guess…
Besides, is it true that they’re tightening security? Was there an announcement about that? Did I hear it, and just forgot about it?

No, normal students would not know.
I was assisting the Young Master with his work in the Student Council room, and I simply overheard it.
In any case, it seems that Yumenosaki Academy received some notice from a terrorist.

T-terrorist…?

Yes. It seems we received threats concerning a school bombing, or something of that sort. Typically, this is the sort of thing that you would just laugh off, but the letter of intent seems to have been sent by some professional.
Just to be safe, we have strengthened our security.

Nnah~, ‘s that true? Sounds like a movie or somethin’.

Truly. However, in the case that something does happen, it would be quite grave, so precautions had to have been taken.
In this peaceful country, everyone seems to have forgotten; dangerous people do not just exist in movies…. they are a part of our reality.

Midnight Gangsters 2
Huh. I was wonderin’ why you were at school in the middle of th’ night, but it’s &#39;cause that “Young Master” kid forgot somethin’ here?

Correct. I was keeping an eye on the Young Master’s studies at the house, like always. However, the Young Master appeared to be quite flustered, and suddenly shouted “I forgot my homework at school!”
I thought he was using that as an excuse to get out of doing his work. “I forgot my homework, so I can’t do it now,” …something like that.
However, when I looked into his eyes, trying to figure out if he was lying or not, I could tell that he was telling the truth…
Reluctantly, I decided to come and retrieve it from the school.
Of course, I made it clear to him that if this had been concerning official school documents, saying “I forgot” would not be a sufficient response.
In any case, it is not as if I could allow the Young Master to walk around after dark.
It is a bother, but I have come here in his place.
I heard him out, and it appears that it was homework assigned by Kunugi-sensei.
He is very strict, and so I expect that the Young Master would be unable to get away with acting innocent, in the event that he forgot to complete his homework.
He’ll be scolded in front of everyone for forgetting his homework.
That would be quite embarrassing, and is why the Young Master was so flustered.
Well, it is his own fault, after all, and it would probably be good for him to be ashamed as much as possible, for his own good… or so I thought.
But, he would likely start crying pitifully, and so I caved in to avoid that situation from arising.
Honestly… I really should avoid spoiling him this much, shouldn&#39;t I?

Fufu. Yukkun, you’re like that “Young Master” kid’s mother, huh. ♪

I will humbly refuse being called that.
He shouldn’t need it, that troublesome brat… Besides, if you’re going to make that comparison, shouldn’t you refer to me as a father, not a mother?

But y’have that sorta feel t’you, Yukkun… y’have a real kind way about you; even I think you’re easy to talk to. ♪ I’m pretty bad with manly people, y’know.

……

Nnah, ‘m sorry? It’s rude for me t’say that to guys, right? You’re real cool, Yukkun, I swear, so don’t worry!

Oh, that’s not it. Please be quiet for a moment.
…Did you hear any suspicious noises, Kagehira-sama?

Wha? Don’t say anything scary like that! Is there someone else who stayed late…?

…Don’t speak. Come this way, Kagehira-sama.

W-what? What’s goin’ on…?

It would be nice if I was worrying over nothing… my body is starting to become roused, and I feel that’s a bad sign.
Perhaps, there is a possibility that the terrorist who sent that threat is lurking about in the darkness.
There is a chance that that is the case, so we need to be on high alert.
If this worry passes, then this can be a funny story for later, when we look back upon it.
But we need to take caution for now, and stay hidden as we leave the school, just to be safe.
…Let us not become separated, Kagehira-sama.

Oh, okay… Yukkun, you seem like you’re havin’ a little too much fun, here?

Oh, do I seem that way?

Uh huh. Yukkun, you’re smilin’ and everything.

(Hm… it’s not as if I feel particularly pleased, but when I touch my face, I can definitely feel a smile there.
Well, it is said that when beasts are on the hunt, they possess expressions like that of smiles. That must be what this is.)


(Ah, how nostalgic, this feeling… My senses are heightened, and my thoughts have dissipated. I truly am a beast on the hunt for its spoils.
I had forgotten it for a long time—the scent of the battlefield.)

    Yuzuru Fushimi’s Childhood, in the fields of a private military company…

(………
Ah… This place is soaked with the scent of gunpowder.
To think that the day has come, where I miss the sweet smell of the Himemiya residence gardens.
It’s not like I’m thinking about going back there, though. A guy like me fits in with this place much more, I think.)[2]


397! 398! 399! 400…!
Instructor, sir! I’ve completed my four hundred squats, no problem… ☆[3]

Ibara. Several times during the two-hundreds, you were slacking off on your yells and movements to make it seem like you were doing them, right?
This is training for a reason. Instead of pretending to do it right, follow the rules and do it the proper amount of times.
Since you were trying to trick me, do one hundred more squats as punishment.

Wha? Tch… You were spacing out so I thought I could get away with it!

I always must keep an eye on you. Honestly, to think I have to put up with such a problem child like you.

That’s what I should be saying to you. Shouldn’t you be going back to your mansion already, Your Highness?[4]
We are risking our lives every day. You’re such an eyesore, playing around without a care in the world, Mr. Make-Believe Soldier!

It’s not like I can do anything about it; I’m here at my parents’ will. The Himemiya family is just starting out in the world, so they have a lot of enemies. I’m training so I can protect their heir in case an emergency happens.

Ahaha! Imagine, parents who would throw their beloved child into a military company!
If you call that familial love, then this world is really sick. Ah, I’m glad I don’t have either of my parents…☆
I don’t take orders from anyone, and I can grab hold of whatever I want in my own hands!

Well, if you want that to be true, then you shouldn’t be slacking off right now. Relying on mutual support is a comfortable way of life, but living on your own requires you to get stronger first.
And now you’re trying to trick me again, by distracting me with talking and skipping numbers. You’re doing fifty more after this.

Whaaat? Hey, aren’t we gonna be here forever at this rate!?

Enough with all the worrying, it’ll be over as soon as you get going. C’mon, you can do it…♪

Ughh~ You monster! You drill sergeant! You son of a b*tch![5]

    One Year Ago…

You absolute idiot!

…Well, that’s one way to say hello. Why’re you so out of breath, Morisawa?

Are you seriously asking me that? I’ll be angry if you’re actually being serious, Kiryuu!
…I know I shouldn’t be harsh on you like this, but I just don’t understand. Why did you do that?
Without my knowledge, you threatened my seniors from Ryuseitai for always being mean to me…
I got worried when they stopped coming to school all of a sudden, so I went over to visit them, and that’s when I heard about what happened. They were practically shaking in fear. I felt really bad for them.

Haha, they bullied you, didn’t they? There’s no reason for you to worry about guys like that.

But they’re still my comrades, technically… It is true that they were awful to me, though…
But at this rate, they may never come back to school.
If I could just keep the unit running together with those seniors, things would start improving, and we would finally be rewarded for our efforts.
I truly believed in that possibility… But now you ruined it.

Is that why you’re so angry at me?

What I’m angry about, is that you&#39;re not taking care of yourself.
This issue was settled before things got worse, but… We’re idols. It doesn’t matter if what you did wasn&#39;t violent; if you let even a single rumor like that spread, then your future’s done for.
You could’ve lost all your dreams, just because of me.
That’s why I’m angry. You need to take much better care of yourself…
You’re a good guy, after all. I refuse the idea that you won’t get rewarded for being one. I’d despair if that happened.

…My bad. Guess I&#39;ve just been too stressed out lately, and I ended up taking it out on them.
I’ll be more careful next time, so just let this whole thing go.

A-Alright… Sorry, I made it sound like I’m blaming you.
I’m happy that you did something for my sake. So thank you.
But please, no more of this, Kiryuu.
I’ll be fine. I’ll make sure to live a happy life under my own power, even without you protecting me.
I promise you that. So please, don’t do anything dangerous anymore.


    Location: AV Room



    Present Time…

Yo, Morisawa… Why doesn’t Ultraman just transform so he can fight already?

Alright, let me explain! Ultraman can only fight for a few minutes, so he has to make sure to time his transformation properly!
Besides, Jack—Oh, that’s what fans call the Return of Ultraman franchise, by the way.
Anyway, he can only use that power to fight for the sake of justice!
He can’t transform for his own personal gain! He can’t use it just to show his good side to people, or just because it’s easier to do things by transformation!

Huh… Oh, it’s like how policemen can’t fire a gun like it&#39;s nothing.

Yep! Using your immense power only for the sake of justice—That’s exactly what being a hero means!
The moment you ignore that fact is the moment you become one of the giant monsters yourself! It would just turn to violence! And mayhem!

Haha, there’s a lot more to these kid shows than I thought.

Yeah! Jack has all kinds of life lessons that anyone could learn from, I almost wish it’d be used as part of the school curriculum!

Uhh, I dunno how that’d work out… I mean, he beats down the monsters with violence at the end of the day.
Sure, you could show it to kids who know how to control themselves… But no one could ever become Ultraman.
If people start thinking that they’re heroes, that they’ll beat up all the evil monsters… then all I can imagine is a future where people start beating up their own friends.
This ally of justice business should just be left to the police.

But what if the police were also, in some way, evil?
Police are called “burglars in uniforms” in some countries, you know?
Some use violence to quickly solve things for their own selfish gain… They just become the same thing as gangs.
If those that were meant for justice turned evil… What would we do then?
Let’s take a moment to think on it! And I’ve got just the thing for this—I present to you a special edition book of all the Imitation Ultras…☆[6]

Morisawa. It’s midnight by now, shouldn’t you be going home? Your parents are gonna be worried sick.

I could say the same to you. It’s not like you to stay here late, usually you go home early so you can pick up your sister.

My dad said he got out of work early today, so I let him do it.
Besides, I think she’s rebelling against me lately… She gets really angry at me when I come pick her up.

Ahaha, it’ll be fine, she’s your sister! Your sincerity will get through to her!
There has to be a reason why she’s acting so cold towards you! Let’s think about it together! ☆

Should you really be worrying about other people right now? You’ve also got your newbies in Ryuseitai who&#39;re getting annoyed at how much you pay attention to them.
Neither of us should be interfering too much on stuff, huh.

Yeah… Knowing how to treat your own juniors is tough…
I thought up so many different things that I wanted to do for my juniors, once I’d scouted them in my unit, but, you know…

Ideals and reality are completely different from each other. Just take it easy, all you gotta do is go face-to-face with them about things, yeah?
You can’t simply fix everything up with a happy ending after defeating all the monsters.

Yeah, that’s exactly why we dream of being heroes! Okay, how about we finish off the rest of Jack for tonight! For the sake of understanding the great wisdom from our predecessors!
The night isn’t over yet, Kiryuu…☆

Whaa…? How many episodes are left? Aren’t we still at the prologue…?

Midnight Gangsters 4
(Ahh man, what now… he’s not budging one bit… He really doesn’t look like he’ll be going home anytime soon.
He may look like the type who’s easy to convince, but he’s actually got a stubborn side to him…
That side of him hasn’t changed at all… He’s looking a lot brighter since we became third years, but he’s still the same old Morisawa.
I don’t wanna make him miserable again… Yeah, I should quit it with this dumb business, and just go home.)
…Morisawa. I just got a message from my dad, he asked me to come back home ‘cause he can’t make dinner on his own.
Sounds like there’s no food, so I gotta buy some groceries first. I wanna feed my sis proper food, so I’m gonna head home now.

Hm? Oh, then let’s go home together! Give me one moment—All these DVDs are mine, so I have to take them back home with me!
If it’s alright with you, please help me put everything back in my bag! I’ll help you out with your shopping in exchange!
Takamine—I mean, one of my unit’s newcomers is from a greengrocer family, so he knows where the good shops are! I’ll ask him right now!

Don’t, it’s the middle of the night. Let’s go quick, it’s getting really, really late. I’m making my sis wait for me on an empty stomach.
…Hmm?

What’s wrong, Kiryuu? You’re wrinkling your eyebrows again!

Ahh, I think it’s becoming a habit of mine… Idols should always be smiling, or it’s just no good, ain’t it…?
(…But what is this presence I’m sensing? It gives off a real intimidating aura… I’m actually getting goosebumps.
I really did let my guard down… I’ve been around so many weak guys since I got into this school, that I misinterpreted it as me just being really strong.
But when it’s the real deal—When it’s guys who fight for a living… that’s when you’re never sure if you’ll win or not.
I really was stupid for thinking I could get rid of this terrorist problem.
But… If we’re talking about something valuable about me… The only thing that comes to mind is my experience in these things, and the ability to fight.
Becomin&#39; the shield to all those people who’re living peaceful lives, even if I have to use violence…
This is how I can be useful… ain’t that right, Hasumi-danna? That’s what you told me, but maybe I’m being mean for interpreting your words in this way.)

Kiryuu!

…Oh. What’s wrong, Morisawa? Keep it down a li&#39;l.
I’m gettin’ a bad feeling… Someone suspicious may be in school, so just leave your stuff here and go home immediately.
I’ll escort you to a safe place.

You absolute idiot.

…Huh, that’s the second time you’ve called me that now. Brings back memories.

Is this really the time to be laughing? If a friend of mine is about to do something stupid, then I’ll do whatever it takes to stop them!
I’m not entirely sure what you’re trying to do, but I won’t let you go ahead with it.

…Ohh? Now this is interesting. Go ahead and try, then.
…Wait, this ain’t the time to be playin’ around.
Okay, okay. I won’t do anything dangerous, alright? We’ll leave that sort of thing to the police and go home.

A-Alright. Yeah, that’d be nice.

Haha, you’re a hero, aren’t ya? Say a cool catchphrase, or somethin’.

Yeah, but there’s no such thing as a script in the real world. But really, why were you staying here so late today?
You were acting strange, so that’s why I tried to hang out with you.

Ahh… I think you could already tell, but all that stuff about my sis being hungry and needing food was a lie. Oh, but I really did leave the job of picking her up to my dad.
Truth is, during my unit practice session, Hasumi was talking on the phone about something suspicious…
Yumenosaki was sent a terrorist warning, y’see. Something about putting a bomb in the school soon enough.

B-bomb…?

Yeah. But there’s like a billion students roaming around in this school—It’d be impossible to place one during the day.
If I were a terrorist, I’d put it in the dead of night, when no one’s around, and where no one could find it.
So I decided to be on the lookout for any sign of a terrorist for the night, and capture them if I find them.
But then you pushed this whole “watching tokusatsu shows together!” thing on me to hang out with me, so I couldn’t keep up my lookout.
Anyways, I don’t even need you to tell me how stupid it was to think of doing this in the first place.
I must’ve been out of my mind. I guess I got hasty… Y’see, the student council’s been on the receiving end of some harsh comments lately…
Hasumi’s acting like everything’s okay, but he’s actually really stressed.
Even innocent ol’ Kanzaki’s been feeling dejected about this.
I couldn’t stand to watch them be that way. That’s when I decided to save the school from the bad influence, and make this school’s reputation a little better.
But that was reckless and idiotic of me.
…My hands have been dirtied since a long time ago. It’s too late for me to try and be a hero, anyway.

You’re a hero in my eyes. You’re always saving me.
Isn’t it enough that I see you that way?

Yeah, I suppose it is. I’m such a lucky guy… I should be satisfied with just that, shouldn’t I?
Let’s go home, Morisawa.
…I meant it when I said I sensed something suspicious, though. Just be as cautious as you can.

A-Alright.
Ahh, man… Everything was supposed to have become peaceful in this school… So why is this happening…?

    Location: Private Military Company Practice Grounds



    Back to Yuzuru Fushimi's childhood…

………

Ibara~, are you alive? Let’s take a break from morning training, and have lunch.
Look, I borrowed the kitchen today, and I made some food.
There were enough ingredients to put something together, but there wasn’t enough seasoning. I asked one of the merchants who comes here sometimes to order some.
You eat nothing but rations, so to make sure you still have taste buds, you should eat something delicious sometimes and get back your energy.

You acting like that is making me remember that you’re supposed to be a butler when you grow up~. Honestly, I think that being a soldier or a hitman is more your calling.

What do you mean, ‘when I grow up’? I’ve been a butler since the moment I was born. That’s not going to change, whether I wanted to be a butler or not, you know…
…Anyway, could you get rid of the piece of glass you’re hiding by your chest?
I’m not going to give you any openings.

Hmph~… So you caught me. And here I thought today would be the day I ended your life.

Why are you being so prickly?[7] It is as if we were fated to meet here, so let’s do our best to get along.[8]


…Even if we become friends, aren’t you just gonna go home soon?

Well, eventually, yeah. But until my parents say I’ve completed my training, I think I’m going to be staying here forever.
This could go on for years… my family is very strict.

Haha, no wonder you’re a sadist; you got it from your parents!

Who are you calling a sadist?
Speaking of which, Ibara, do you seriously not know what your parents were like at all?

You sure don&#39;t hesitate in asking the tough questions… I dunno~, I don’t really care.

Is that right… well, if you’re interested, it’s possible that I can ask the Master of the Himemiya family to investigate, you know.

It’s none of your business. My parents threw me away, like I was some used-up roll of tape. Even if we were reunited, we’d all just be unhappy.
This isn’t some sappy reality TV show. If I met up with them, I’d pretend to cling to them with tears running down my face, only to strangle them to death.
“Daddy, Mommy, thank you for giving me this life! Now die!”
Don’t you feel that way, too? They’re parents who abandoned their young child at a private military camp; don’t you resent them for that?
Can you even call them your family?

…I have thought that, before. But, I also understand that this is a necessary thing for me to do.
The Himemiya family that I serve is a nouveau-riche, so they’ve been facing jealous people with grudges from every direction.
The family is a bit showy with their money—they are the ones who own this military camp, after all.
So that the next heir to the Himemiya family, the Young Master, does not get abducted or assassinated or face any hardships…
I plan on serving him, at his side forever, and so I need this sort of military training.

“Let him who desires peace prepare for war.”—you’re one of those types, huh?[9]

Who even said that?

It was just in a holy scripture that I managed to pick up in my spare time. When I actually sat down and read it, though, it seemed like there was some pretty great stuff written in it.
Anyways. That being that, in order to be the perfect butler, you’re here to pick up some skills, huh.

Yeah. For that reason, I’ve been training here at this military camp.
I think that memorizing housework and courtesy is more fun, but I’ve found that this sort of thing is fun, too, now that I’ve gotten used to it.

It’s not normal to find this fun~. Even the adults who come here for training end up giving up.
Aah, that pisses me off. You must be a talented person, huh… I guess “God never gives two gifts” is a lie, then.

Ibara, if you keep at it, you’ll improve too. You have good muscles, after all.

I don’t wanna work hard. If anyone appears to have strength, they’ll be let out onto the actual battlefield, and I don’t want that.
I don’t wanna die yet~. Not without having anything that I was glad to be born for.
At the very least, I want to get my hands on something that I’ll find myself spending my whole life treasuring.
If I head to my grave, without bringing with me something like that, there will be nothing left of me, like ash that flies away when it’s blown on.
Don’t you think that’s incredibly hollow, Instructor, sir?

Please don’t call me that…
I’m something like a guest here, more or less. I may be treated like a superior, with too much respect, because of that—but the truth is, you’ve been here for longer than I have.

I started training after you, though~.
Up until then, I was staying in an orphanage-like place, that takes care of kids who have nowhere else to go. Once you’re old enough to graduate from there, you get thrown straight into this place.
What a lovely system for mass producing soldiers cheaply~. It’s disgusting.
No one takes out their wallet for charity cases. Ahh, it makes me sick… I bet even God is too disgusted to look.
Money, money, money… Those who have money are celebrated, and everyone else is just trash.

How ill-natured, you are… If you came into money somehow, you would just be resented, just as my Master is.

What luxurious problems that guy must have. Love doesn’t fill your stomach, you know, Your Highness?

But it does satisfy your heart. I think. I can’t just believe in lip service like that, though…
But that’s what my grandparents and parents, who have served the Himemiyas across generations, have said.
In my case, those feelings have yet to spring forth within me. It sounds almost too good to be true.

Midnight Gangsters 6

    Location: Hallway, Second Floor



    Present Time…

(Honestly… Everything still seems unbelievable, like a dream, right now, Ibara.
For the sake of my master, and for the sake of the Himemiya family, I desperately trained, but my body has still not made use of the majority of those skills that I burned into it…
Now, I am somehow living my life as an unbloomed idol.
I wonder where you are, and what you are doing at this very moment. Did you ever find that important thing, that you want to carry with you to your grave?
I, myself, have found it.
After being left at the military camp training school for such a long time, without ever being allowed to return home, my young self began to sulk…
But it was befitting of my nature to remain there, so I had rigorously immersed myself in training.
I thought it better to face the battlefield and dissolve like the morning dew, than to spend my entire life as a millionaire’s pet dog…
Taking hold of my own life, standing in a place where I can control everything—I thought there was no more satisfaction than in that freedom.
However. When I said that as a joke, you were seriously angry with me, weren’t you, Ibara.
You, who always told pointless lies, and was ill-natured.
You called me someone who lived luxuriously—that I should have been satisfied with my life, because I could obtain anything and everything that I could possibly want.
Despite him being such an sorely prideful person, Ibara had even said that he was jealous of me.
And then… Well, I reluctantly came back to the household. Now that I think about it, I suppose that really was my short-lived rebellious phase.
Back then, I truly wanted to die on the battlefield, just to make my parents feel miserable, didn’t I…
I wanted to hurt them, since they had hurt me.
But, well, that immature melancholy of mine was blown away in an instant.
When I returned to the mansion… by chance, my parents were absent, and I was embraced by my sobbing Young Master, who was house-sitting all on his own.
“I was so lonely, please stay with me,”
I will never forget the warmth he gave me, at that moment.
Rather than being a beast that ends others’ lives so cruelly, I realized that it would be better to be a person who protects the life of someone so small and precious.
That there is nothing which can compare to the value and meaning of doing such a thing.
I truly, finally came to see that. I do not know if I am doing a well enough job, and my parents’ scolding still has not faded away, even now.
But I want to stay true to being a butler, and do the best that I possibly can.
For the sake of my Young Master, and for the sake of making using of my life—my existence—in a meaningful way.
I shall carry it with me, to my grave—this lovely warmth.)

Um, Yukkun, is it okay if I talk now?

Hm? Oh, yes, go ahead.

Okay. Man, when I say stuff like that, I feel like someone who can’t get a hint… I don’t like it.
Even I know that I’m the type a’person who’d die first in a horror movie…

What are you talking about?

Never mind. Um, aren’t we walkin’ kinda slow? Yukkun, I know y’said we should be sneaking around ‘n be careful…
But at this rate, by the time we get home, it’ll be morning already.
O’course, I get it, there might be a dangerous scary person lurkin’ around somewhere.
If we do somethin’ careless, then we might never get to go home ever again.
I don’ want that t’happen… But if I take a while to get home, there’s a chance that Oshi-san will come an’ meet me here. He’s actually quite the worrier, y’know.
If Oshi-san got attacked by that, um, terrorist person &#39;cause of that, it&#39;d be awful. I’d carry the regret with me beyond the grave.
So. Yukkun, can you gimme your phone for a sec?
I just wanna call Oshi-san’s house. I wanna tell ‘em that I got all fired up at karaoke with you and we decided to pull an all-nighter.
Then, even if somethin’ bad happens, at least Oshi-san won’t hafta get involved.
So, is it okay? I don’ have my phone on me today, so I wanna borrow yours.

Hm… I agree with you. It’s always important to keep the worst possible outcome in mind.
Indeed, there is the possibility that my Young Master will become worried over me and come to the school, as well.
Even though he is quite the crybaby and generally timid, he can be surprisingly decisive at times. It is thanks to that that I am always being dragged around by him.

Ahaha, my Oshi-san and your Young Master sound kinda similar, somehow ♪

Fufu. We both go through difficulties, don’t we, Kagehira-sama.
Just a moment. I’ll give you my—
…Hm?

I dunno who’s over there, but you’ve finally given me an opening.
I’ve been waiting for this. In battle, patience leads to victory…!

…Kagehira-sama, get behind me!

Nnah, wha? Wh-wh-what’s goin’ on?

(You’ve finally made your appearance, criminal! It might seem as if I’ve left you an opening, but you’ve been thoroughly ensnared!
You seem to be a formidable opponent, but… Trained warhounds can completely take down wild, carnivorous beasts, such as yourself.)
Prepare yourself…! I have no prior resentment towards you, but you shall die for the sake of a safe future for my Young Master!


Huh? Wh-, wait, wait, wait! Stop! Did you just say, “Young Master”?
You… Are you actually Fushimi, from fine?

Oh? Are you not Akatsuki’s Kiryu-sama…?

………

…Well then. For now, shall we share what we know with each other, and figure out what is happening?
It seems as if we may have wasted quite a bit of time doing something incredibly foolish.

It was all just a misunderstanding! I’m glad! There were no bad guys in this world after all!
It was only a tragedy brought about by a terrible misunderstanding between one another! Let’s do our very best to learn from our mistakes so that this never happens again! Promise me that! ☆

Morisawa, you’re seriously loud… We haven’t actually made sure if the terrorist is around or not… Also, it’s midnight right now, so you’re gonna bother the neighborhood.

Ahh! Sorry! A weight was lifted off my shoulders, and it put me in a weird hyper mood!
It’s like, I’m suddenly really exhausted, but I’m also feeling super hyper! Fuhahaha! ☆

Totally getcha. It’s like this loud guy says, I didn’t even do anything, but I feel tired all of a sudden…
I always sleep at this time, so I’m feelin’ sleepy now that I’m at ease…

Ahh, yeah, it’s pitch black now.
…Uh, Kagehira, you live with Itsuki, right? It’s dangerous at night, should I walk you home?

Nnah?! No no! I’m like, just fine, really!

Both you and Itsuki don’t seem fine, though… Meh, I guess I don’t really have the right to say anythin&#39;.

Everyone~♪ I’ve finished calling. I requested the family chauffeur to escort us out.
You will be brought safely back to your homes, so please, do not worry.

Oh, sorry for the trouble. Thanks a lot. My neighborhood ain’t the safest place, so I didn’t want to be walkin’ around there this late at night.

Fufu, we are all idols, after all… You must keep yourselves safe, and not take any chances.
It is quite presumptuous of me to go to this length, but please do accept this favor of mine.

Yukkun, you’re usin’ too many big words, so I don’ really know what you’re saying…
Um, so you’re bringing me home by car? Thank you very much ♪
You’re a lifesaver. I’m so tired I don’ think I could walk. I’m gonna try and sleep in the car.

Same here! What a strange night we had… I feel like I got some valuable experience out of it.

You think? All that happened tonight was two morons mistakin&#39; each other for a terrorist, and then almost startin&#39; a fight over it.
Anyone watchin&#39; would think it’s some ridiculous joke—This is so idiotic, I swear.

But I’m glad nothing bad actually happened. We’re looking back on it and laughing because we now know it was all a silly misunderstanding.
If something like this happens again, don’t try to solve it by yourself. Please just contact the police authorities.
I don’t want to see you get hurt, Kiryuu.
After all, a civilized country is a place where the law judges the people. People aren’t supposed to be doing the judgement.
Heroes who take down evildoers by themselves can only exist in tokusatsu shows, unfortunately.

Haha, can’t believe you of all people would say something Danna would say.
You’re a proper hero, alright? Even if you don’t ever punch bad guys.

………

…What’s up, Fushimi? Everything’s been settled. Why’re you still making a face?

No… Something seems a little off.
(As a butler of the Himemiya family, my handling of the situation should be correct. I shouldn&#39;t be trying to deal with this matter on my own, and instead should leave it to the professionals.
I reported it to the security firm held by the Himemiyas just a moment ago, and they quickly dispatched their personnel.
In fact, if the terrorist really is lurking about, they will be able to handle it perfectly.
But, I wonder what this discomfort is… No, this feeling of déjà vu, rather.
I have this unsettling feeling, as if I have been skillfully manipulated by someone.
As if my thoughts and actions have been read, and been conveniently used.
It would truly be nice if everything was a misunderstanding—including this feeling, too.
‘Nothing bad happened’, ‘there was no ruffian’, ‘nobody was hurt’…could we really let this all end with a ‘happily ever after’?)
…Fufu. This isn&#39;t good, I let myself become too nervous over things.
It seems the car is here to pick us up. Let us head home, everyone.


    Location: Hallway


♪~♪~♪
Alright everyone, attention! From here on out, under the pretense of searching for the terrorist lurking inside the academy, we’re going to thoroughly investigate every nook and cranny! Salute~☆
It doesn’t matter if it’s trivial!
Who likes who, their weak subjects, their test scores—investigate every single thing about these students, and compile the data.
There will surely be a day when it all becomes useful. Fu fu fu, everything is going according to plan…♪
(Obviously, after receiving a terrorist threat, Yumenosaki Academy would make their security stronger.
However, as they have directed security reinforcements to search for this terrorist, they have left quite the hole in their plan.
Within their security personnel, I have placed my own people.
Those comprising of Yumenosaki Academy’s defenses are branches from that private military company, after all.
There exists many people within this company, that I have soaked with poison to do my bidding.
They are being controlled, exposing Yumenosaki Academy’s weaknesses and flaws through their positions.
This is not some TV program. Wolves are always lurking in sheep’s clothing.
Even if it is corrupt, Yumenosaki still stands at the top, as the industry leader—it is a nuisance to the rest of us.
The day will come, sooner or later, when we will clash. That is why I must build up my forces, until they are flawless.
Let him who desires peace, prepare for war.
I said that to you, but you still wound up forgetting it… Instructor.
When I saw your name on the list of students enrolled at Yumenosaki Academy, I broke out in a cold sweat, but… you’ve gotten surprisingly dull. It’s a shame, really.
Ever since then, I’ve rigorously trained, built up experience, and gotten stronger~. Different from you, who’s been lazing about in this peaceful place.[10])
If we met on the battlefield, it would be my win. I would kill you in one clean shot, right in the head.
Ahh, I cannot wait for that day to come!
Life is truly wonderful, ahahahaha!! ☆)




Translation Notes
↑ Mika says 塵も積もれば何とやらやろ here, which is supposed to be the idiom 塵も積もれば山となる (“even a pile of trash becomes a mountain, if you keep piling it up”). Either he decided to cut it off, because he figured that Yuzuru knows the rest, or he simply forgot how the idiom is supposed to end.↑ Yuzuru uses 俺 (‘ore’) here, instead of his usual わたくし (‘watakushi’) for his pronoun. It’s a lot rougher and more boyish than what he typically uses—‘watakushi’ is quite formal, like the rest of Yuzuru’s current speech style. I believe he is trying to distance himself from his position as a butler, and fit in more with the atmosphere of the military camp. Also, while current Ibara speaks in formal speech, young Ibara speaks in typical casual speech here. He also uses 'ore', similarly to young Yuzuru.↑ This is the only moment Ibara speaks in formal speech, as it was his attempt to deceive Yuzuru into thinking he completed his squats.↑ Ibara calls Yuzuru お坊ちゃん (‘obocchan’) here. Basically, he’s trying to mock Yuzuru, since he comes from a well-off place, even if Yuzuru isn’t actually a Young Master, like Ibara is calling him.↑ Ibara doesn’t exactly use ‘drill sergeant’ here; he says something more along the lines of “demon general”. ‘Drill sergeant’ fits nicely though, considering the situation and what he was going for. And yes, Ibara does call Yuzuru an (albeit censored) son-of-a-bitch.↑ Imitation Ultras, also known as Fake Ultras, are basically villains who pretended to be Ultraman for the sake of infiltration, ruining Ultraman's reputation, or just to be as powerful as Ultraman.↑ This is a play on words. Yuzuru says ‘prickly’ here, meaning ‘ill-natured’, but it is also a reference to Ibara’s name, which means ‘thorny shrub​’.↑ Yuzuru says 袖振り合うも多生の縁, which essentially refers to someone who you meet by chance, who you feel to have had a connection with in your previous life. It’s really quite profound, considering that Yuzuru is pretty young here.↑ Ibara is quoting Publius Flavius Vegetius Renatus’ De re militari, Book III, here! The actual Latin is si vis pacem para bellum! It’s a Roman military tactics book. This book isn’t actually a scripture, but Ibara seems to consider it to be one.↑ Ibara uses ‘ore’ here. Nowadays, he typically uses ‘jibun’.]]></content>

The Cursed Ox Statue 1
Location: StarPro Office


Ah, the weather is quite lovely today. Despite the lingering summer heat, it’s the perfect day to go to school.
Having graduated, I can’t help but feel somewhat nostalgic watching those who commute to school as summer vacation ends.

……

Putting that aside—Yuzuru. Keeping quiet won’t get you anywhere.
You probably want to give me your report and head to school as soon as possible, don’t you? There’s no need to put it off, you can go ahead and tell me.
About that certain phenomenon involving you all, that is.

My apologies. I did mean to inform you; However, it became difficult to summarize, and I myself am somewhat disoriented as I am not quite sure where to start.
Since I can’t seem to find a way to put it shortly, I suppose I will tell you the story from beginning to end.
This is how the state of affairs at the Starmony Dormitory came to be.

Location: Old Starmony Dormitory


Time: Immediately following the MDM, in the old Starmony dorms, ALKALOID’s room

Good morning, esteemed members of ALKALOID. Have you finished your preparations in order to move out?

Indeed, I don’t have many belongings to begin with, so it did not take long.

It does all appear to fit into a single cardboard box. Fufu. By the looks of it, you’re a minimalist quite like myself.

Minimalist…? What does that mean?

It refers to an individual with a principle not to carry around more than that which is indispensable. Since the dormitories are quite small in comparison to our residence, I had been trying to educate the Young Master on the concept…
From now on, the four of you belonging to ALKALOID will live in the new Starmony Dormitory building alongside the rest of your fellow idols.
As the old building will become unoccupied, I must advise you to please ensure that you do not leave any of your belongings behind.

Fufu, so this day has finally come.

I feel as if a weight has been lifted from my shoulders… It’ll be lonely to live in separate rooms, but I’m so glad we didn’t get fireddd…♪

Indeed.
I’ll miss all of you dearly as well, but whenever there is a parting, a meeting shall follow.
I’d like to express my thanks to the old building for taking us underachievers in our time of need, and let us look forward to the next chapter of our lives.
Now then, shall we take our things and go our separate ways?

Huh, you guys are ready to leave already!? Am I really the only one who hasn’t finished packing yet?

You still aren’t finished yet, Aira?

Watch your mouth Hiro-kun! That isn’t very nice of you…
I have a lot of items to pack so it takes time. Someone with so few things like yourself wouldn’t understand!

Indeed… If that’s the case, you should become a minimalist like Fushimi-senpai. It takes a lot of time to pack up if you have a lot of stuff, after all.

Hey, don’t think I’ll just let you get away with saying that!? My ‘stuff’ isn’t just stuff! It’s treasure! My treasured idol merch!
Idol fans are totally the opposite of minimalists!

Is that so? The antonym of ‘minimalist’ is ‘idol fan’. I understand now.
It’s amazing how many treasures you have, Aira!

That’s not what I’m trying to say at all!

Fufu. You two get along so well.

Ummm, Aira-san, would you like me to help you? If you don’t mind, that is…
I tend to sweat the small stuff since I’m so nervous, so I’m quite good at organizing important items— if that makes sense…!

No worries, I got this! I’m gonna live under the same roof as idols I totally look up to― so I have to take care of myself!

You do have a point Aira-san.
From now on, you will be living with other people. Living with a stranger will require you to be more independent.
Yuzuru-san, I apologize for the fact that you had to come all the way out to the old dormitory. Would you kindly give us a bit more time to vacate the room?

Please, do not fret. You mustn’t worry for me.
This job was assigned to me by Eichi-sama, which grants us a certain lenience in terms of schedule. Furthermore, I have enlisted the assistance of a few more helpers from StarPro.

Helpers…?

Indeed. I had them wait outside for a moment in consideration of your privacy, yet I believe it is about time to call them in.

Yuzuru? Can I come in already?
I’m tired, I seriously can’t deal with Morisawa-senpai anymore!

Oh, my. Speak of the devil.
Yes. Young Master, Morisawa-sama, you may come in.

Fuhaaahahaha~! I’ve kept all you good kids waiting!
Ryusei Red is here to aid you in your cleanup!
Now then! Which luggage should I carry first? It’s always sad to say farewell, but our passionate hearts can blow those feelings away! Come, let’s move all your luggage with high spirits!

All this energy’s got me exhausted by now…
It’s not like I wanted to show up in their room uninvited, but think about how I feel being stuck with this guy!

Oh, what’s up, what’s wrong!? I don’t sense any energy from you, Himemiya!
We can’t be like that! It’ll make it harder for ALKALOID to part ways, you know!?

No, no, it’s not that kind of vibe at all here. They’re still gonna be close enough to see each other whenever they want anyway, it’s not really that serious.

…As you can see, the Young Master is acting as a supervisor. We requested Morisawa-sama’s help with the transportation of the luggage.
A baggage handler could have been contacted, yet Eichi-sama considered us qualified as “no one would be as understanding as a fellow idol”.

I see. Communal life necessitates communal work.
Thank you for taking time out of your busy schedule to help us. The lord will surely take note of your good deeds.

The Cursed Ox Statue 2

Time: A few hours later

Phew, all done~! I finally got everything packed!

Good job. All that is left to do now is to carry these boxes to the new building.
The sun may have set, but fortunately, we will be able to finish moving by tonight.

It seems I’ll be sharing a room with Koga-san. He seems rather difficult to get along with, I’m a bit concerned I may accidentally upset him.
As for everyone else, who do you all share your new rooms with?

I’ll be with 2wink’s Aoi Hinata-kun, and Crazy:B’s Shiina-san. Fufu, so Crazy:B are also moving out of the old dormitory.

I… I ended up with Mashiro-san of Ra*bits.
Oh no. I wonder if we can live together without any problems… Now I’m getting nervous…

You’re a very compassionate person, Mayoi-san, you should have no trouble. You love thy neighbor as thyself.
…And Aira-san, who are you sharing your room with?

I’m… with Tenshouin-senpai and Sakuma-senpai…
No way! I can’t, I can’t! Ohmygosh I’m gonna dieeee!

Well, if you’re unhappy, I’ll switch rooms with you?

That’s not what I mean, you idiot! I’m so happy it feels like my heart is gonna stop! I’m gonna die because I’m so happy― that kind of feeling!

…? I don’t really understand that feeling, but, I suppose things are fine as is.

Now then, please leave the remainder of the work to me. I’m sure you’re quite busy with the new semester starting tomorrow, so allow me to complete our moving paperwork.

You have been such a great help to us, Tatsumi-senpai. Even today, you’re taking care of us as the eldest in ALKALOID.
Just thinking back on it, the time spent in this room is full of precious memories.
Even though it has only been a month, it feels as if more has happened here than in the decade or so that I spent in my hometown.

Yup, I agree.

I feel the same.

And I as well. I feel as if I’ve been saved, and I have you three to thank. I must give my thanks to this room, the place where I was able to live together with you all.

Then I shall also say thanks! And now we press onward― to Starmony Dormitory!
We’ve taken our first step as idols, and I can only hope this new building will treat us well.

Location: Starmony Dorm Common Room


Yuzuru-san, I’ve filled out the paperwork, will that be all?

Let me see.
…Yes, there are no mistakes here. That concludes the procedure of moving into the new building. Thank you all for your hard work today.

I should be the one saying that to you― thank you for staying here so late. Your classes will start tomorrow as well, won’t they? I truly do appreciate all you’ve done for us.

Oh, there is no need to worry about me at all.
Besides, the members of ALKALOID aside from yourself have classes tomorrow as well, do they not?
I truly hope that everyone will be able to rest well, although the new environment may cause a certain uneasiness.

Fufu, after overcoming such an ordeal as they have, they should be fine.
In any case, there seem to be many Yumenosaki students in their new rooms. I think they’ll fit right in.

Fufu. Tomorrow, the Student Council is gonna give a speech to the whole student body, so you’d better be excited for it ♪
It’s a shame that it’s gonna be the new prez giving the speech and not me, but we’ve gotta show those guys still holding onto summer vacation the power of the Student Council!

Indeed. This is an opportunity for Isara-sama to prove himself.
Oh, come to think of it, before we part—there was a forgotten item in the old building, so I must ask you as a final request to please take it with you.

Forgotten item…?
That’s unusual. I don’t recall seeing such a thing while we were cleaning.

I was surprised myself. I found it while I was checking the old building as we were about to leave. Does this ox statue ring any bells, by chance?

Hm…?

Huh, this is one strange-looking object, isn’t it?

Ugh, so tasteless… Does this belong to someone in ALKALOID?

I’ve never seen such a thing while I was residing with them… How about I reach out to them over Hold Hands and send a photo?
…Ah, it appears they’re just as lost as we are.

Hmm… Then what was this thing doing in the old building? It seems pretty unlikely that those Crazy:B guys would’ve left it there as a joke.

That’s true. Crazy:B would always go for tactics that make them stand out— Plus, one of them cares deeply about his brother. I can’t imagine them going for such a subtle kind of joke.

I don’t think they’re responsible either. We all lived in the old dormitory together, but they hardly interfered with us.
Given the circumstances prior to MDM, I wonder if something was left behind in the room after all…

But in that case, who should it be returned to…? I haven’t got the slightest idea.
For the time being, I believe we should leave this statue at the Starmony Dorm as a lost item.
It does not appear to be expensive, and if it is placed in the common room, its owner may eventually find it.

Indeed, that seems like a suitable course of action.
O ox statue with nowhere to go, may you find your rightful owner in the end― Amen.

The Cursed Ox Statue 3
Location: Starmony Dorm Room (Tori, Yuzuru)


Time: The next morning

(Fufu. Reading in the morning turned out to be surprisingly enjoyable.)
(Since I no longer reside in the mansion, I have no use for the time I spend awake after waking up at sunrise…)
(Fortunately, I discovered the joy of reading through my participation in the filming of Fist of the Shangri-la Idol.)[1]
(In this way, I can make use of my spare time thinking of and envisioning lives vastly different from my own. By learning of the world that surrounds oneself, one can also gain knowledge applicable to their own life.)
(To be a proficient butler for the Young Master, I should keep in mind the various teachings and philosophies that I have learned and put them into practice myself.)

Hmm… (mumble mumble) …Yuzuru, I can’t eat that many manjuus…

What is he dreaming of, I wonder…?
It is about time. Young Master, please wake up. The second school semester will start today. As part of the Student Council’s leadership, we cannot afford to be unpunctual.

Ugh… five more minutes…

If I were to give you five more minutes, we would be late. Is something as disgraceful as arriving late to the Student Council’s speech truly the impression that you wish to give to the entirety of the student body?

Okay, okay, I’ll get up…
Look! I got up, Yuzuru~ Help me with the usual routine.

Of course. First, you must attend to your appearance. Please wash your face in the bathroom.

Alriiight.

Young Master, here is your towel.

(scrub, scrub)…♪
There. Now it’s time to get dressed, and after that we’ll go to the kitchen for breakfast, right?

Right. I have prepared your clothes for you. Everything has been cleaned spotless.
Despite how you proclaimed that you would &quot;take care of the unpacking yourself&quot;, the uniform was still in the closet, so I took it upon myself to clean it up ♪

That’s our Yuzuru. Number one in thoughtfulness ♪
…I mean, I would’ve done it if you just told me! I said I’d take care of my own matters by myself, didn’t I?

Sigh. Your unceasing stubbornness is quite troubling.
I am more than aware that you wish to become more self-reliant, but you cannot go to school wearing a uniform covered in lint and dust.
Furthermore, you postponed washing your uniform to the point that there was no choice but to order a new one, did you not?

Hmph. Well, I don’t want to go to school looking all shabby…

Time passes

…There. I’m done changing. This is fine, right?

No. Your tie is crooked.

S-so you noticed. You see, I was actually testing you!
Anyways. Now that we’re ready, let’s go have breakfast in the common room!
Hm~hm~hm ♪ Today starts~ the new semester~♪ Let’s have fun this new semester~♪
Gyaah!?

Young Master!?

T-T-T-T-Th…

What is the matter? Pointing your finger—
Hm. That is the ox statue from last night. I cannot fathom why on Earth it would be in front of our dorm room…

Hey, Yuzuru! Can we cancel today’s plans? Someone definitely has it out for us!
Someone who fears the Student Council’s authority put the statue here as a warning to cease all Student Council activities!

Where did you get that idea…?
In any case, be at ease. If anything were to happen, I would protect you, so let us head to the dining room without a worry.

Even if you say I shouldn’t worry, I’m still worried! Waaah!

Y-Young Master, please calm down. Even if this truly was an act of malice towards you…
There would be no need for such a warning to be expressed in a manner as roundabout as an ox statue placed in front of our room.
If you think about it rationally, does it not make much more sense for it to be a simple coincidence?

B-but, I’m scared! Yuzuru, do somethiiiing!

Sigh. This is quite the elaborate prank.
Was there any particular motive to put the statue here, I wonder…?

    Season: Autumn


    Location: Classroom 1-A


Wassup, Midori-kun! Since you’re hanging around in the classroom during lunch break, I’m guessing you’ve got nothing to do? You’re in the Basketball Club, so we should go and play some basketball.

Basketball…? Nono, I refuse…!
I’d rather stay in this air-conditioned room than suffer outside in the heat… And if I play basketball, I won’t be able to escape being reminded of how suffocating Morisawa-senpai is.
I wanna soothe myself with mascot characters during my break time, at least…

Uumyu… But you’re so tall; it’d be a waste not to make use of it through playing sports. Also, I’m just hanging around doing nothing ‘cuz I have nobody to exercise with, y’know~
Ah! We could do karate instead! We can do it indoors, and it’ll cool you down!

No, really, can we just move away from sports first…?

Yo, Tetsu.

T-Taishou!? Why’re you here?
Could it be… you noticed that I wanted to exercise, and came over to train me!?
Wow, you’re awesome, Taishou! I’m in awe!

That isn’t why I’m here. Since you’re here, this must mean it’s classroom 1-A, right?

Hmm? Yeah it is, but… Wait, I’m not mixing things up, am I, Midori-kun?

U-Um. You’re not…

Oh, you were talkin’ to Tetsu, I see. I’m here for that first year boy.
Long time no see, Takamine. I got lotsa help from ya Ryuseitai folks back when I was practicin’ my role for the drama shoot.[1]

Ah, yes…
…Wait— D-D-Does that mean you have something to talk about with me…!?

‘Course I do. That’s the reason I came all the way here. Lemme borrow ya for a moment.

Ohhh!? I never would’ve expected Taishou to ask Midori-kun for anything…!
Are you gonna invite him to the Karate Club? But he’s already in the Basketball Club, y’know~! And I mean, like, look at him — He’s shaking all over!

Uuu… Am I gonna be tied up and thrown into the ocean…? I’d rather die than be tortured alive… I wanna die…

Whaddya take me for…?
Chill, I’m not doin’ anything to ya — I just need to talk to you about somethin’ important.

You heard him, Midori-kun! You’ll be fine, Taishou’s much kinder than he looks. I’ll even be there to hear him out with you~♪

Oh, nah. Sorry Tetsu, but I’d rather you don’t join us.

Whaaa!? W-Why not…?

It’s a li’l complicated. Takamine, couldja come with me alone to the rooftop?

O-Okay… Ahh, this might just be where my life ends…


    Location: Rooftop


Good, nobody’s around.
Let’s get right to it. I got a lotta things to ask ya — answer ‘em for me, aight?

U-Um… Did I ever do something to anger you?

…That isn’t why we’re here.

I-I’m so sorry. I’m being a shameless first year, aren’t I? But I really, really can’t think of anything I’ve done to you…

No, really, that isn’t what I’m tryna say.
My bad. I look like a punk, so I must’ve given you the wrong idea.
Takamine. I heard you know a lot about mascot characters. Tell me a thing or two about ‘em.

Huh…?

Y’see, it’s a li’l hard to talk about this in front of Tetsu. He admires my masculinity, so it’ll hit me hard if he calls me a siscon or an overly affectionate big brother.
…I think you saw her last time, but I have a li’l sis, y’see. She told me that there’s a certain mascot that’s been popular around her school lately.
But I dunno a single thing ‘bout what’s trendin’ these days, so she snapped at me, tellin’ me I’m ignorant. She’s right though, I’m such a shameful big bro.

Kiryu-senpai…

That’s when I remembered Tetsu tellin’ me that you know a lot ‘bout mascot characters.
I know this is sudden, but if it’s alright with ya, couldja tell me a li’l about ‘em? Please, I’m beggin’ ya here.

P-Please stop! You don’t have to bow…!

Nah, I gotta, or I won’t feel right about asking you for this.
…Or what? You think it’s weird that a punk-lookin’ tough guy like me wants to know more about mascots?

N-No. I’m pretty timid despite my height, so people often tell me that I’m different from what they expected…
Also, mascots are loved by everyone, regardless of gender. I refuse to let anyone make fun of a guy for liking them.
I could teach you anything if it’s gonna be about mascot characters. But I always ramble on for days about them, so… Are you sure you wanna know…?

Yup, that’s just what I wanted. You’re free to ramble for the rest of our lunch break.

O-Okay then…
Ummm… What type of mascot is popular in your sister’s school…?

Ahh, I think it looks like this plushie here. You really can’t tell whether it’s meant to be an alien or a veggie, huh…[2]

Wha— You mean Carrotian!? Wait, isn’t this handmade?

Yeah. Made it by watchin’ how plushies are made. I was gonna give it to ya as thanks.
Tell me if it looks too shabby or nothin’ like the mascot. Sewin’ up a plushie requires a different method from outfits, y’see.

That’s amazing…!
I already knew that you make unit outfits, but I didn’t expect to see you manage to recreate Carrotian’s cuteness perfectly…!
Heheh, he looks adorable… I’m so happy…♪
Carrotian barely has any merchandise, so finding out that he’s not only popular among kids, but even has his own handmade plushie feels like a dream come true…♪

It makes ya that happy to know that this Carrotian dude is popular?

Yes. He’d been struggling for a long time as a low man — low mascot on the totem pole.
I’m from a greengrocer, so that’s another reason why I’ve been secretly cheering him on… I’m so, so happy to hear that he’s finally getting popular…♪

Haha, low man on the totem pole? He sounds like one of us idols~♪
But it sounds like I could get to know him better than I thought. I feel like I get why he’s trendin’ now — and why mascots are a thing.
Aight then, how about you start tellin’ me his story from the time he was at the bottom?

Okay, I’d be glad to…♪

    Season: Summer


    Location: Running Grounds


One, two, three! ♪

Ow, owow!! Please do it gently, Mitsuru-kun! My spine will break~!

No way it will! You’re more likely to get hurt if you don’t do some stretch exercises, anyway!
C’mon, just bear with it! One, two, three~♪

Owow… You’re too rough… It’s just like how a guy would do it…

You’re a guy too, y’know? I’m sorry, I don’t really know how to hold back…

Ah, it’s alright. I’m just too weak.
But I’m always causing trouble for everyone because of my lack of stamina, so I have to build more muscle.
In fact, I’d like to become more strong and energetic, just like you~♪

Ahem. That’s right, you should learn from me some more~♪

Heeeey! Mitsuru-saaaan!! Yoohoo, it’s Mamaaaaaa~! ♪

Ugh— Mike-chan-senpai, you’re gonna practice today…?

Hahaha! You’re being too formal! C’mon, you’re free to call me “Mama”!! ♪

You’re not my mama…
Wait— Oh? Anzu-neechan!

Oh, Anzu-san. Hello~♪
You look like you’re ready to do exercise. Are you thinking of exercising for the same reason as mine?

Heheh, Hajime-chan’s worried about his low stamina… So he wanted to do some runs with me~♪

Ahaha. Surprisingly, performing as Ra*bits needs a lot of stamina, since we tend to jump around.
I’ve been falling behind thanks to it…
But I can’t continue to let that happen. That’s why Mitsuru-kun is helping me out by training together…♪

Well done! A gold star for you! Anzu-san’s the same — she’s been feeling tired lately, so she said she wanted to build more stamina.
Though in her case, it’s just because she’s been overworking.
Since she’s not gonna be decreasing her workload anytime soon, I suggested her to build stamina instead, under my training plan.
You may end up feeling worse with the wrong type of training, so yeah.
I plan to instruct her in every step, like a gym instructor.
If you two are okay with it, we should build muscle together~♪

Waah, it would be a lifesaver. Mitsuru-kun is the genius type of kid, so he doesn’t seem to be the best at teaching.
Honestly, nothing he’s saying makes much sense to me…

Hrmph! I don’t get why it’s not coming to you! You just gotta move your body like, bam!

Sound effects won’t help me understand… I-I’m sorry.

Nah, it’s my fault for sucking at explaining things.
…Sooo I guess we’d benefit way more if Mike-chan-senpai teaches you instead?

Yes-siree! I haven’t been doing anything club captain-like — I gotta guide my juniors every once in a while~♪
Well, in your case, Mitsuru-san… You have a specific goal to beat your current best record, so a typical, straightforward training wouldn’t hurt you.
But these two just wanna build more stamina, which is a more broad kinda goal.
We gotta figure out a fun way to train, so it can encourage them to keep at it.
And so! Let’s play tag! ♪
I’ll be “it”! I’m gonna chase after you guys once I count up to a hundred, so run away now! Ooone! Twooo! Threee!

That was outta nowhere… Uh, huh? We’re gonna be playing tag?

Hahaha! Kids grow stronger through all the outdoor games they play! Well, in the olden days, at least.
Have fun, enjoy yourselves, and grow up big and healthy! I want you all to become great adults!
You’ll grow bored of training if you keep stressing yourself to do it just ’cause you gotta. The most important thing right now is to enjoy yourself.
Let’s have tons of fun today! You’ll wear yourselves out with too much work. It’s good to have a fun day every once in a while~♪
Nooow then! Start running! Run as hard as you can, even if you’re just playing!
Hmmm, if I call myself “mama” instead of “it”, would Anzu-san and Mitsuru-san start calling me that, too~?
No matter! Eiiight! Nine! Ten! Twenty! Thirty!
Hahaha! I may have said I’d count to a hundred, but I never said I’d count one by one!

Ah, you cheater~! You’re always like this! You just do whatever you want~!
We gotta run, Hajime-chan, Anzu-neechan! Who knows what’ll happen if he catches us~!

Ah— Wawawa? Please don’t pull me over, Mitsuru-kuuun~!
Ehehe, but this is fun already. It really is nice to train stress-free…♪
Mikejima-senpai knows what’s most important, doesn’t he?

Don’t get impressed yet! I won’t believe it until I see proper results from this “training”! He could just be playing with us, y’know?

Ninety! One hundreeed! Alright, alright! It’s festival tiiime! Here I come here I come here I cooome!! Let’s have some fuuuuuun!!!

Eeek! W-We gotta run, now! He’s really like an ogre![1] He’s gonna gobble us up if he catches us~!!

I’m not an ogre, I’m Mamaaa!! C’mooon Baby-chans, Mama’s gonna embrace you gentlyyyyyyy!!!

(Sticks out tongue) Bleegh~! You never show up to our club, so there’s no way you could beat me in running!
You’re not gonna get me! Dash, dash, dash~!!
C’mon, c’mon! Come catch me if you can~! Hahaha! ☆

    Season: Summer


    Location: Arcade


Yes, yes! This is the commoner&#39;s amusement facilities, the so-called arcade, right!
Good work on guiding me here, Jun-kun!
Your weak point is that you only do what you&#39;re told, but your strong point is that you do what you&#39;re told well!
A Plus Minus Zero☆
Keep at that, today, tomorrow, and the day after that too! As long as you keep serving me to the minimum of my expectations and not betray them! Ahahaha! ☆

Ohii-san, you&#39;re waaay too loud. Quit making a racket in a way that disturbs the social norms~ Just being with you is embarrassing.

Jun-kun, Jun-kun! I&#39;m in a pinch! You see, I don&#39;t know a thing about this!
I’m wondering what I have to do so that I can play the games here in this arcade thing! You should teach me from top to bottom!
That&#39;s your duty, isn&#39;t it, Jun-kun!

…I always say this, but could you please listen to people when they talk?
How about at least pretending to listen to what I&#39;m saying, hm~? Ugh, you really irritate me.

Just kidding! I hear what you’re saying, but I have no reason nor obligation to bother with listening to your requests, so I only ignore them.
Hey, Jun-kun! If you still don&#39;t get it, then let the kind me teach it to you!
I&#39;m at the top, and you&#39;re at the bottom. Those who stand at the top have the right to choose, correct?
I&#39;m the main show, but you&#39;re only an extra, yes?
The one who chooses where to go is me, so the ground that’s only being stepped on saying &quot;Walk here&quot; is simply nonsense, don’t you think?

You&#39;ve got that kind of personality yet you still managed to live this long without being stabbed, amazing… In a way I&#39;m impressed, Ohii-san.

I&#39;m often told that! But the real world is unfair, you see? No matter how much the weeds wail in despair, the food chain will never change!
But you know, while I was chatting and pretending to make sense, I&#39;ve been so graciously awaiting your answer!
So you better answer what you were asked for, Jun-kun!

Yeah, yeah… Hmm, I&#39;ll explain from the start, in a way that assumes you&#39;re an idiot who knows nothing.
An arcade is a place to play games.
Is there any game you want to play, Ohii-san? Or is it that you simply wanted to inspect the common people&#39;s playgrounds?

Yes, yes! I can&#39;t quite spread myself out there when I&#39;m in Reimei Academy, after all.
Now that we&#39;re far away from it for the sake of Summer Live, I&#39;m seeing this as a vacation to enjoy myself as much as I want!

And now you&#39;re talking about a completely different topic… I&#39;m used to it though.
We&#39;ve got some work to do, so don&#39;t go and relax yourself too much, alright~?

How boring of you to say that, Jun-kun! You win first prize for &quot;Being Boring&quot;! Congratulations! I&#39;ll smash your head open for you with this prize trophy!

Are you a demon that kills when someone answers wrong…?!
We&#39;re coming here as representatives of our school, so I&#39;m only saying not to do something that would be embarrassing for us.

There you go again, saying something boring!
Its fine. As long as we show results, no one will complain, right? If we keep ourselves on guard all the time, our performance will only falter.
Although, I actually thought our opponent would be Eichi-kun, and had my guard up…
But after talking to the representatives, going by the name &quot;Trickstar&quot;, I got to understand what they are.
Their extent of talent is the kind I&#39;ve turned into stepping stones and devoured up to reach my current social status.
There&#39;s no need to have our guard up, because they won&#39;t possibly be able to trip me off my feet.
Honestly, what a let-down…
That’s why this time that we&#39;re outside of the academy, I want to successfully try something like &quot;My very first time experiencing the arcade!&quot; so that it doesn&#39;t go to waste, you know?
Also, I got jealous when I heard you played in an arcade thing by yourself!
I don&#39;t think that kind of head start is good you know, we&#39;re meant to be two souls in one!

What &quot;two souls in one&quot;… you&#39;re just saying whatever you like… I did the job you were asked to do by an acquaintance in your stead, remember?

Oh, that&#39;s right. I was asked to test play a new game, yes~ But it was a pain so I pushed it all on you!

I feel like my life&#39;s crammed up with all the stuff you keep pushing onto me, y&#39;know~?

Yes, yes, that&#39;s what your life is! I want you to thank me, you are truly blessed!

Can this person just die already… I wish he&#39;d get his divine punishment… Please do your job properly God… (mumble mumble)

But if I die, you&#39;ll only go back to a miserable life again, won&#39;t you? That&#39;s what I meant when I said we&#39;re two souls in one.
We’re united, so let’s get along to the best we can.
It&#39;s thanks to me that you were able to be out in a place full of light, and that&#39;s why you can&#39;t defy me.
You can only be a slave that is completely obedient to me.
That kind of person, the kind that can never get away from me is just what I need. So let&#39;s get along to the best we can, Jun-kun~♪

Yeah yeah… If that&#39;s what you wish, Ohii-san.
So how about we try the games you think you&#39;ll like? And treat me to this, at least every once in a while~ Ain’t you rich?

Jun-kun, Jun-kun, I want to try that! The gun shooting one! It looks absurdly fun, c&#39;mon, hurry!
Be my meat shield guide! I’m going to go right in there through the shortest route!

Heeey, don&#39;t push aside the other people playing~… He has no manners at all… This bastard of a noble…
Honestly, I feel like a servant of a selfish princess…

    Season: Spring


    Location: Classroom 1-A


Thank you for your hard work on class duty, Tomoya-kun. Do you have anything at the Drama Club today?

Nah. I was actually just thinking about whether I should head home or check out the shopping center.
What about you, Hajime? We haven’t been walking home together lately unless we have something to do as Ra*bits, soo~ Come and join me if you have nothing going on.

Heheh, the Tea Club has the day off today, so I also have free time. I’ll accompany you anywhere~♪

…………

Woah, Takamine…!? At least say something if you’re gonna get so close to us…
Mmmrph—!?

Shh, shhh…! Please, please don’t speak so loudly…!

Heeey, Takamine! Where did you go~! Come on out wherever you are~!

Eeek!? He’s already here…!?
N-Neither of you tell him I’m here, please…! I’m begging you…!

Phew…! Ahh geez, don’t cover my mouth outta nowhere…
…Wait, huh?

Takamine-kun went to hide under the teacher’s desk~ He seemed really frightened, so let’s not talk to him for now.

Got it… He looked like he was freaking out. Maybe something awful happened and he’s now running away from it?

Takamine! There you are! Let’s go play basketball and shed the sweat of youth once more…☆
Wait, huh? Umm, you two are in Ra*bits, right? Is it just the two of you here?

Y-Yes. Umm, are you looking for Takamine? He was here a moment ago, but left ‘cause he had something to do.

Mmm, so I missed him by a second. Alright, thank you for the information!
Takamine~! I’m going to make sure I find you no matter where you go! Fuhaaahahaha!! ☆

…Takamine-kun, he left. You can come out now.

T-Thank you… He’s extremely insistent… I’m so grateful that you managed to make him go away…

Don’t sweat it — it’s just what classmates would do for each other.
Anyway, that guy’s a third year, right? Is he chasing after you ‘cause you messed up somehow?

No, he just comes over to pick me up from class every time we have club practice, which is super annoying… so I had to run away…
Ughhh, it’s already bad enough that we’re in the same unit together — why does he have to pester me when it comes to the club, too… so depressing…

Erm, I think you should go to your club, though… Didn’t you join it because you like basketball?

Not at all… I was just invited by Morisawa-senpai, and had no choice but to join… I don’t actually have any drive to play…

Oh yeah, ‘cause it’s mandatory to participate in club activities in Yumenosaki… I think there’s plenty of guys like you who had no choice but to join one.

Oh, I see~ Personally, I joined the Tea Club because I always liked tea.
I’m always feeling excited all day whenever it’s time for the club to get together~♪
Our club president is very kind, and he’s always teaching me how to properly brew tea. He even brings over such delicious sweets…
He’s perfect at the job — sometimes I feel like I’m being served at someone’s house.

Sigh, I’m so jealous… Our team captain is like that, so… I just feel suffocated and annoyed and frustrated…

I know exactly how you feel. Well, no — ours isn’t suffocating or anything, but he’s so extreme with everything he does…
I would’ve quit instantly if Hokuto-senpai wasn’t around.

You sure talk about him a lot… Oh yeah, I think there were a few Trickstar members in the Basketball Club, too…?

Hold up, you only vaguely remember your club members…? Oh well, I guess you haven’t been there for that long… I know who’s in mine ‘cause there’s only three of us in the club.

Huh? Only three…? Can you still do club activities with that amount of people…?

Dunno… I was told we’ll be doing something soon enough, so something should start happening in the club.
And actually, there were way more first years at first, but they all ran away thanks to that masked freak. I’m the only one left.
…Like I said, if Hokuto-senpai weren’t there, I would’ve ran away myself.
That’s just how mentally tiring it is to be alone with that masked freak.
But Hokuto-senpai’s always covering for me and encouraging me, and he’s so cool—
The masked freak may be a weirdo, but I respect Hokuto-senpai from the bottom of my heart~♪

Oh, what… You may be complaining, but you’re also enjoying your club in the end…
I’m not enjoying it at all… Not my club, nor my unit, nor my school life… I’m going through the gloomiest youth…

Awawa, please cheer up~!
To be fair, I’m not always having fun at the club—
Sometimes I feel really stressed, or rather, I get very nervous when it’s my turn to brew tea for my club members.

Yeah, I get nervous when I have to perform an act in front of Hokuto-senpai. I do get complimented, but there are waaay too many times I’ve messed up.
But he’s always clearly explaining to me how to improve my acting — it makes me wanna practice even harder and meet his expectations.

I know what you mean~! I’ve made mistakes before, but they always tell me what to do.
They praise me whenever I’m lacking in confidence, and it made me want to work harder to brew better tea~♪

Ah—…

What’s up, Takamine? Did something come to mind for you, too?

Ummm… I’m new to basketball… So I’m always just standing there, without a single clue on what I’m supposed to do…
That’s when Morisawa-senpai tells me to go for the shot… I just throw it without thought, and it doesn’t get anywhere near the goal, as you’d expect…
But he still praises me for it… Telling me that I’ll be able to do it next time, to practice hard and go for it again…
I get annoyed from all his blabbering… so there was once a time when I tried shaking him off by throwing the ball randomly, and managed to score a goal…
That moment felt so exhilarating that… I might have found basketball fun to play…?

I see, I see! You really were having fun with us, then!

Eep— M-Morisawa-senpai? W-Why’re you here…!?

A hero will always come rushing to the person who calls for him! ☆
…That was only a joke — I just couldn’t find you no matter where I looked, so I tried going back to places I’ve checked before.
Then I heard your voice from your class, and came rushing before I knew it!
I see now, so you’ve finally realized the joy of basketball. I’m so happy~ Today will be a basketball day to commemorate! ☆
Now then, let’s head off! Let’s enjoy a sparkling youth together! ☆

Eeek— Stop, don’t grab the back of my collar~! S-S-Save me, you twooo…!

Please do your best, Takamine-kun!

Break a leg, Takamine!

Arghh, dammit— Don’t just stand there…!
I wish I never said anything if it was gonna end like this…!!

    Season: Autumn


    Location: Starmony Dorm (Mitsuru, Midori, Tsumugi, and Ibara’s Room)


—Mm?
Midori-chan, Midori-chan!

Hm? What’s up, Tenma-kun?

One of your plushies fell down! The poor little guy is all on its own~! Here you go~♪

Wha!? —Ah, you’re right! Thank you.
I’m so sorry for dropping you on the floor, Pen-tagon…

Ahaha, is it called that ‘cuz it’s a pentagon-shaped penguin? That’s sooo weird~

Exactly! It doesn’t make any sense, right!?
It’s so stiff-looking without the round shape of a penguin, and yet the mascot still acts exactly like a penguin would! It’s adorable!
I just love the contrast in the design so much, it’s the cutest bestest thing in the world~☆

Ohhh~? I’ve never seen you this eager before! It’s kinda refreshing!

Ah—I’m sorry… I blabbered nonstop… I can’t hold myself back whenever I’m excited.

‘s all good, I know how you feel~! I get just as excited about my interests, like, I can’t hold in the urge to dash all over the place~♪

Ah, personally, I wouldn’t run around, but… I’m glad you get me~♪

Excuse meee~... Could someone open the door~?

Hm? Did someone say something just now?

Yeah, someone asked for the door to be opened!
Okie-dokie~! I’ll open it now, gimme a sec!
…Um, why’s there a cardboard box at the door?
Wowie~! Midori-chan, Midori-chan, look~! A cardboard box ghost came to visit us~!

Ummm… Isn’t it just someone carrying a lot of boxes? I can’t see who it is, though.

Yes, that’s correct, Takamine-kun. Um, could I come inside now, please~?
I can’t carry these boxes any longer… I feel like I could lose my grip any moment now.

Oh—! I can see a face from the side! And that voice sounds like Aoi-chan-senpai!

Woah, woah—! Be careful!

Aoi-chan-senpai, we’ll help ya out~!

Ahh, thank you so much, this is a huge help.

Here we go~ Hm? Wow, these huge boxes aren’t so heavy after all! Carrying them is no-problem-o~

Oh, you’re right… Veggie boxes are waaay heavier than this…

Ahh, that’s because there are sweets inside, so they’re easy to carry one by one.

Huh!? Sweets!?

Are you planning to eat it all, Aoba-senpai? It seems too much for one person, though…

Then I’ll help ya get through ‘em~! ♪ We’ll be able to eat them all if we share!

Ahaha, neither of us can eat these.

We can’t? What do you mean?
Mmm… Is this a riddle? I don’t get it~

Oh no, no. Umm, you see, I’m going to need them for a workshop that ES is hosting next Sunday.

Workshop?

Yes, we’ve invited children to come visit ES for a field trip.

Ooh… Like, the typical touring around the place and seeing how people work in the company?

Yes, you could say that.

Huuuh… Okay, but then why sweets?

Well, it’s Halloween soon, right? So we’re planning to have the children wear costumes so that we can hand out sweets to them.
It fits the season and all, and we figured it’d make the kids happy, so I decided to split the sweets into their own wrappings as hand-outs. It’ll be like a small souvenir for them.
I was planning to do the wrapping at the office, but I had another job to deal with first…
But I won’t be able to make it without making use of my free time, so that’s why I’ll be doing it now.

Ooh~ —Ah! Then I’ll help you out, Aoi-chan-senpai!

Wha—? No, no, I’d feel bad. It’d just be volunteer work, you know? I don’t have anything rewarding for this… Also, I’m sure you’re busy with end-of-the-year plans, aren’t you?

I’m not busy this week, though~! Also, I don’t want a reward for helping.
I just wanna help make all the little kiddies be super duper dazzled by us idols!
Wouldn’t it be awesome if we could inspire all of them to become idols too when they grow up~!?
Plus, you look super tired, Aoi-chan-senpai! You’ll be able to rest a li’l if I help out, right?

Um, Aoba-senpai… I don’t think I’ll be able to help as much as Tenma-kun, but I could at least help with splitting the sweets into their own wrappings…

Thank you so much. Alright, I’d like to take up on your word then.

Mhm~! You can aaalways count on me!
—Ah! I don’t want money or anything, but if there are any sweets left over, I’d love to have ‘em!

Hehe, that’s completely alright with me. I’ll prepare some sweets for you good boys, too.

Woohoo~! ♪ Ah, but that’d be more like Christmas than Halloween~

Chapter 1


    A week later. During the qualifying round, the final stage…

“hello okinawa, and welcome~! mensooore~♪”[1]

“Fuhahaha! Thanks for coming to see our Ryuseitai and Akatsuki live show today! We&#39;re extremely happy to see you all…☆”
“♪~♪~♪”

“~…♪”

…I thought we weren’t gonna perform a live show…?

Yeah… This is the exact opposite of what they said we’d do… Also, I can’t tell if “mensooore” is being used correctly; I can&#39;t trust anything Morisawa-senpai says—

It was Shinkai-do—Shinkai-senpai who said it, and one can only be a ninja by adapting to every situation, Midori-kun!

I’m not a ninja…

Ahaha. Why&#39;s all this talk taking me back to the old days? Shinobu-kun speaking normally ‘cuz of his order sounds so weird, though.
Anyways, apparently it’s fine ‘cuz it’s a joint live performance, and not a live battle.
Since it’s not a competitive stage of winners and losers. Even if we end up with the worst case scenario, nobody will have their SSL$ confiscated, either… Well, they said something like that.

Really? Isn’t that just how our seniors are putting it…?
But I guess back when we were all in Yumenosaki, we managed just fine by believing in their words and pushing through together…

yes~♪ but ever since ensemble square was established, we also have made a lot of Mistakes—
so i suppose it is Understandable to lose Trust in us.

Eep—! Please don&#39;t jump into the conversation out of nowhere, Senpai!

you should not be Talking right now, anyway~
the people of okinawa are not Familiar with the yumenosaki Tradition to Chat on stage~♪

That’s true. Okinawa may have alotta tourists from all over, but that doesn’t mean everyone’s accepting and understanding of ES’s ways.

Mhm, when in Rome, do as the Romans do!

Well, personally, I think it’s okay to behave freely to a certain extent! On the contrary, different cultures and the strange antics that go along with them can actually be amusing to the audience!

Speaking of strange antics, Morisawa-senpai’s been acting weird since we came to Okinawa, but…
You gonna be okay from here, Ninja-man? You’re not gonna disappear on us in the middle of a performance, are you?

No worries! I’ve calculated and prepared everything to make sure I only disappear for a moment, without it being unnatural!
I even double-checked with the SS administration committee to make sure if the way I planned it was okay, and they were alright with it!

Morisawa-senpai’s strong point is that he can casually ask questions even to people who could be attacking him with malicious intent… I could never do that…

Heheh, I don’t think we need to imitate our seniors. Our differences are what makes us special, and that’s what Ryuseitai’s all about!

…Yeah, I can’t help but find it a bit off when Shinobu-kun speaks like a regular person.

Mhm! But I think it’s pretty nice — it makes you look smarter than usual, Sengoku!

Does that mean I usually look like a bumbling idiot!?

Whaa…!? Don&#39;t take what I say in the wrong way! Why do you guys keep doing that these days!?

yes, it is sad, isn’t it? i do not recall having brought you up to Behave this way, you know~?
but it cannot be helped. after all, this is likely to be a Rebellious phase that came a little late.

It really annoys me when I get told that I&#39;m going through a rebellious phase, ‘cuz it makes me feel like I’m being treated like a kid…
But the very fact I feel that way is a sign that it is that, isn’t it?


Yeah… But please don’t worry, we don’t plan on going against ES’s orders on top of that…
Just ‘cause I can’t stand the higher-ups doesn’t mean I&#39;m gonna disobey them and risk getting told something stupid again, like to revert Ryuseitai back to its original shape…
Besides, my order was super simple — I just had to avoid touching that thing I love during the qualifying rounds…
And I’m not an infant or something… I can put up with it during the rounds just fine…

That thing you love? Oh, I get it now! So that’s why you kept your distance from me all this time, Takamine!

You were the one doing all the avoiding, and I think he’s talking about mascots, y’know~?
By the way, I had some pretty dangerously close moments, like when we were tryna stop Kanzaki-senpai. One of my weaknesses is that my brain stops workin’ whenever I’m overstimulated.
But nobody from the SS administration committee said anything, so I guess that means I didn’t go overboard.

Hmm, so… Was Tetora-kun’s order something like, “no violence during the qualifying rounds”?

Oh, you could tell just from what I said? — Wait, no, I almost forgot that I shouldn’t confirm anythin’.

You’re on a roll, Sengoku! You’re a paragon of intelligence! Also known as the Genius Sengoku…☆

I’d rather not be called by something that sounds like it came from a dictionary… It’s just that I know everyone so well by now, that I can easily tell when they’re acting differently from the usual.

Yeah, I get you… Whenever we have a sleepover, Tetora-kun always works out at every opportunity, and it’s really overbearing…
That&#39;s why I thought for sure his order was “no working out”.

Well y’see, whenever I work out, I also practice karate forms. I’d hate to have those moves be seen as “violence”, though, so…
Like, y’know how Kanzaki-senpai is a surprisingly calm person who pretty much never resorts to violence, but just seeing him with his sword is enough to freak you out?
So yeah, same thing here — I thought it might be outta line to make any move that a viewer could consider “violence”, so I avoided it just in case.

Tetora-kun, you’re a lot more particular about things than one would expect, huh? Like you can’t help but overthink things.

We’re all pretty sensitive people… The only ones in our unit who’re broad-minded and chill enough to get through anything are Shinobu-kun and Shinkai-senpai… the ratio is two to three…

Ohh, you included me in the “sensitive” category, too!? I&#39;m so glad to know that you understand me, Takamine!

Hmph… You do realize we’ve known each other long enough that none of us would still think you’re a hot-headed, dumbass hero without a single thought in his head, right… We’ve all seen you read books with glasses on before you sleep…

What do glasses have to do with it!? Hasumi will get mad at you if you start saying anything bad about glasses!

Speaking of which, the members of Akatsuki haven’t come on stage yet, have they?
If they take any longer, we’ll end up stealing the limelight!

Chapter 3

“♪~♪~♪”

“~…♪ Yo, Morisawa. How about a duet while we’ve got the chance?”

“Ahh, that’s not fair! Morisawa-senpai just keeps stealing everything that matters to me…!”

“Awawa, your microphone is on, Tetora-kun! We’ll get flamed online again if you throw careless remarks like that! Don&#39;t get involved with Morisawa-senpai! Just keep your eyes only on me!”[2]

“That’s also gonna cause its own kind of misunderstanding…”

“You guys, be serious. Birds of a feather flock together — and as such, don’t let yourself get influenced by Ryuseitai, Kiryu. Be true to our rough-and-tough style.”

“Hah? What’s the point of a joint performance if we’re just gonna stick to ourselves without influencin’ each other?”

“Guh… I know there’s nothing I can do about it, but nobody is listening to me this time around. It feels so lonely.”
“No, I should reflect on myself for being so naive in thinking that you guys would always listen to me.”
“I was completely ignorant to the stress you must have felt all this time, due to how I would always do as I lik—”

“Oh, zip it! Quit lookin’ so gloomy! Don’tcha know the main rule for idols is to smile on stage? So c’mon now! ♪”

(Heheh, Kiryu’s incredible as always. He’s always so sincere about being an idol.)
(…I want to do the same — Let’s start from there.)
(We aren’t back to square one, and we haven&#39;t lost anything, either… We’ll go back to our baseline, and build up from scratch.)
(I’m good at that sort of thing, and I already know that everyone in Ryuseitai will work hard alongside me.)


(I’ll never, ever forget the moment you guys rushed over to help me clean up that day, like it was the most natural thing to do. It meant everything to me.)[3]
(The heroes I’ve waited so long for had finally arrived.)
“♪~♪~♪”

Chapter 3
Chapter Translation Note: Nirai-Kanai is Okinawan for “The paradise across the ocean” or “The paradise on the bottom of the ocean”, i.e. the land of the gods. One way to put it in Japanese is umi no kanata, so on top of everything else, it's also a wordplay with Kanata's name.



    Several minutes later, at the restaurant that Akatsuki frequents…

Pardon me!
Hasumi-dono! I have arrived alongside Kiryu-dono, as I heard there is an urgent matter! What on earth happened!?

Mm, well… Sit down first, Kanzaki.
Wait, no, I take that back. You’re free to do as you like. I won’t be giving you a single order.

This is already becoming such a troublesome matter, Hasumi-dono~!
—Mm!?
You ruffian—!

Woah! Don&#39;t make any sudden big moves. And don’t cause a ruckus in the restaurant.

Ah, it really does feel relieving to receive orders from a higher-up…♪
—Nay, I mustn’t indulge right now! Stay alert, gentlemen! There is a figure hiding in the shadows! Could it be an assassin aiming for our lives…!?

What is this, the Sengoku period or somethin’? There’s nobody in this modern age who’d be a professional assassin.

Heh-heh-heh…♪
Brilliant! I applaud your incredible intuition to detect the presence of Ninja-man! I never imagined that someone could break through Sengoku-style Ninjutsu…!

Ninja-man? I do not believe you could be anyone but Morisawa-dono, correct?

Don’t answer him like that. Morisawa is apparently into playing ninja right now.

Indeed! Since I&#39;m currently in a position similar to one, I thought I&#39;d act the part! Plus, I hope to bond more with Sengoku by doing this, since he loves ninjas!
That’s why…! You may call me “Ninja-man” instead of “Morisawa Chiaki from Ryuseitai”…☆

E-Erm…? All right…?

Quit it, Morisawa. You’re confusing our junior with your bizarre behavior.
Besides, what’re you even doin’ here? I heard rumors that Ryuseitai’s been running away with the local idols who’re bein’ bullied, is that right?

Correct! That&#39;s what happens when you answer the call for help! We, Ryuseitai, will always fight for the sake of those oppressed!
…Fortunately, ES idols are still mainly focused on gobbling up each other at the moment, and don&#39;t seem to have time to mess with local idols.
We&#39;re taking advantage of this opportunity to run away and hide, while steadily earning SSL$ through peaceful improv live shows and the like.
We’re getting pretty favorable responses with our performances, likely because the people who came to Okinawa for the shows were also starting to get tired of the endless war. It goes to show that people do prefer peace over war!

Hmm… Indeed, I have heard that.
However, it seems that the scale and particulars of each and every live conducted by the local idols can be ignored, so we are leaving them alone for the time being.

Heheh, I assume it’s because you can crush the local idols and us anytime you like?

Nay, you have been taking full advantage of this area by traveling from place to place. Thus, your unpredictable appearances across the prefecture has left us unable to catch hold of your unit and the rest of the idols.
Considering the time and effort required to search for all of you, it would be much more efficient to target idols from other agencies whose whereabouts are discernable.
Our strengths are different from yours. If we are to continue at this pace, we will surely be the winners of the final qualifying round in Okinawa.

I bet. Heheh… heheheh…♪

Did I say something amusing?

Oh, no. I was thinking that the way you spoke was just like Hasumi — Something about that made me laugh.


…!! ☆

Do not look at me like that.
Wait, no — It&#39;s your choice whether you look at me or not. I won’t be ordering you to do anything, Kanzaki.

You are extremely difficult to speak to right now, Hasumi-dono.

Man, makes you wonder how many times a day Hasumi typically orders around Kanzaki. You guys may be comfortable with it, but from an outside perspective, it&#39;s pretty bizarre.

I think it’s fine if both parties are happy with it, but it does have a sort of archaic feel to it.

Have you come to comment on our relationship, Morisawa?

Of course not.
I’m here to discuss something severely grave.

Chapter 4
Before we start, I should mention something — Morisawa apparently has to withdraw himself from Ryuseitai on a regular basis, likely due to his order.
I had him take advantage of such a position and imitate the likes of a counterintelligence officer, or in other words, a spy. I informed him of this when we first met them in Okinawa.
Actually, at first, I asked Sengoku if he could do it, considering I’ve been getting him to keep me regularly updated on how the Student Council is doing, as I tend to worry about Isara as the president.

Wait, so that mysterious “Ninja Room” next to the Akatsuki group chat on HoldHands was basically DMs between you and Sengoku?

Hmm. If you require such information, I could have asked Sengoku whatever you wanted in my dorm room, as we are roommates.

The student council is none of your business, is it?

Heheh, well, they aren’t doing anything wrong in that room, so there’s no problem either way. Sengoku seems to be happy to have a chance to act like a ninja, too!
Thanks for playing with my junior, Hasumi.

I&#39;m not playing with him… Though I do think I should reward Sengoku sooner or later for acting as my subordinate.

I recall him saying he’s simply returning the favor you did for him in Scroll of the Elements, so don’t worry about it.

Hmmm. I have an inquiry: why is Morisawa-dono being used as a counterintelligence officer rather than Sengoku for this occasion only?

It’s a little bit over-the-top to call it “counterintelligence”, really — I’m more like a middleman of some sorts.

Either way, I’m mostly doing it just in case. I have a feeling that there is something off about ES, especially since SS started.
ES is usually built around the delicate balance of power among the four major agencies.
But now, I get the feeling that the entire corporation is moving under someone’s conscious volition — in a way that is disconnected from the four agencies’ motives.
Normally, if I observe the actions taken by Eichi, Sakuma, Saegusa, and Aoba—
I would be able to grasp the intentions of the four major agencies and guess the overall composition and the story that will be told in the future.
But right now, how do I put it… It’s an incoherent mess. I feel as if I’m being placed in the hands of some god or other and manipulated as a convenient pawn, instead of a human being.
Maybe it’s all in my head, but nonetheless, I don&#39;t trust ES as a whole. That’s why I wanted to avoid using HoldHands as much as possible, since it’s run by them.
If they wanted to, they could look into the conversations going on in the app.

That&#39;s why we’re exchanging information face to face like this.
As mentioned multiple times before, I can go out on my own on a regular basis without raising any suspicions.

Well, you have been acting suspicious, really. However, you have no choice but to make unnatural movements due to your order, so you’ve always got that excuse up your sleeve.

Hmmm. So Morisawa-dono moving around on his own truly is a result of his order?
I had thought that he was doing something similar to Hasumi-dono.

What do you mean?

When a reliable person, who usually leads everyone, takes a step back or temporarily leaves—
I would assume it would be to prompt the independence of his subordinates, who only follow orders with acquiescence.
As a matter of fact, now that Hasumi-dono is no longer giving me orders, I have no choice but to do my best on my own.

Thanks to that, though, we discovered Kanzaki&#39;s unexpected talent.

Hmm, well… Maybe that kind of thing is more your unit’s style.
…In our case, it didn&#39;t work.
“Don&#39;t do everything for them, but keep your distance and watch over them. By doing so, we can encourage them to grow and become independent.”
That&#39;s what I wanted to do, and to some extent it worked. But before that theory and those efforts bore fruit, it all went back to the way it was.
What exactly went wrong with us…? Was it bad luck, the times, or was it just—


Don’t you hear yourself? You’re beyond help because you refuse to hold a grudge against others. Were you a fool who laments unreason and blames everyone around you, I could still sympathize with you.
But excessive goodness and holiness only lead people astray, Morisawa.

Honestly, it’s more like he just blames himself for everything. He’s a gloomy guy at heart.

Woah, what’s going on here? Is it suddenly time to criticize me for my inadequacies?

No, this is the time to listen to what you have to say.
Though, you have been acting and behaving indiscreetly this whole time, so it is likely not an urgent matter anyway…

No, really, it&#39;s a pretty bad situation. It’s so bad that it doesn’t feel real — it’s hard to even talk about it with a straight face.

…What do you mean?

I’d like you to remain as relaxed as possible while you listen to what I’m about to say—
The truth is, it seems that our Kanata has been enshrined as a god by a local religious group.

———!

Chapter 5


    That night, in a prohibited area within Okinawa…

W-What’re we gonna do…?

What d’ya think!? We have to save Shinkai-senpai!

Um, uhhhh, how, exactly…? Everything’s happening so fast that I&#39;m having a little trouble keeping up…
Isn&#39;t this basically a crime? Are we sure everything’s okay? S-Should we call the police or something…?

Hmmm, I think that would be a hasty decision. As of this moment, there is no specific incident that the police could investigate.

B-but…! Shinkai-senpai was taken away by some religious people! What’re we supposed to do if those suspicious people do suspicious things to him…!?

Tetora-kun, your wording sounds like something a six year old kid would say.

Ughhh~!! I can&#39;t think straight when nothing makes sense!

Whenever you’re in a panicked state, it’s a good idea to write down what you know one by one.
Personally, that is what I do whenever my mind goes blank.
It’s time for Ninpou: Slow and Steady Jutsu…!

Your ninjutsu basically reeks of life hacks, huh…

Well, they are useful because they benefit daily life. Even if I was capable of breathing fire from my mouth or conjuring up a giant toad, I would be incapable of solving anything.

Ohh, the way you just casually shrugged off all those flashy ninjas that appear in manga and stuff… Sometimes you come across as calm, in a way… Or maybe it makes more sense to say that you go about things in a modern way…

Y-You two sure are calm, huh…? Or am I just panicking way too much?

Nah, it’s just, it doesn’t really feel real to me somehow…

To be honest, it&#39;s not something to panic about when you think about it calmly.
The local religious group, I assume…? Simply offered a meeting with Shinkai-dono, and he agreed to it. That is all there is to it, that we know of.
The people he is meeting are religious people, but they aren’t evil spirits of any kinds, so it isn’t like they’ll eat him up or something.

But I&#39;m still worried! It&#39;s a religion I&#39;ve never heard of! They were wearing strange clothes and saying a lotta words I dunno~!

Heheh. But we also wear hero outfits and have long conversations about tokusatsu shows, so in a way, we may be similar to them in other people’s eyes.

Yeah, we shouldn’t be prejudiced against them… I dunno about you, Tetora-kun, but Shinobu-kun and I have been hurt before by people staring at us like we’re weirdos.
I don&#39;t think it&#39;s right to disregard every single thing about someone when you don&#39;t even know anything about them…

Oh, how surprising! Midori-kun’s opinion is so mature!

Heheh, I guess that means I&#39;ve grown up a bit, too…
Well, I do think something like a suspicious religion or whatever sounds creepy, though…

What was the point of saying all that, then!?

Well, just ‘cause it&#39;s creepy doesn&#39;t mean it&#39;s okay to trample all over them… I think… Maybe.

I-I think you’d have sounded way cooler if you said that in a cool way, you know!?

Now Shinobu-kun’s vocabulary is reverting to six year old level… That’s basically like saying “my headache hurts”…

That just shows how we aren’t actually in a calm state!

I mean, I don’t blame us — Everything happened outta nowhere.

No, actually, Shinkai-senpai was acting a bit suspiciously…
It just wasn&#39;t as noticeable since Morisawa-senpai looked way more suspicious with all his constant disappearing every so often.
I think Shinkai-senpai was talking to those strange religious people in secret after every live show we&#39;ve been doing…
The religious people seemed to be related to the local idols we were running around with…
I thought they were just wearing what looked like Okinawan folk clothing… like, dressing up that way to please the tourists, or whatever…

Midori-kun, you’re surprisingly attentive to your surroundings, aren&#39;t you?

Heheh, I’m taller, so I have a wider field of vision…
Ahh, why’d I go and hurt myself by saying that… I’m so depressed…

You didn’t need to mention it if it was going to depress you…

Anyway! There&#39;s no point in chatting about random stuff! I wanna go and save Shinkai-senpai right now, but what do you guys think?

I think I&#39;d like to wait and see what’ll happen… Shinkai-senpai said something like, “be good boys and wait until I’m done talking to them”…
And nothing bad has ever happened by following his instructions, soo…
He may look like he’s just standing there without a thought in his mind, but he has a much greater perspective of everything than I do…
It’s like he’s looking at everything from above like a god, so I feel like I can never go wrong by listening to him… ‘Cause he’s always right about everything…

I getcha, but… They’re just treating us like kids again and leaving us outta the loop, aren’t they?

Yeah, but we snapped at them ‘cause of that, so I&#39;d like to think that our seniors won&#39;t continue to do it over and over again…
But who knows… They’re just the overprotective type in general, after all…

Hmm… For the time being, I have contacted Morisawa-dono, who is once again doing something separate from us.
He has instructed us to avoid using HoldHands as much as possible…
But we have no choice this time around. It’s an urgent situation, after all.
Morisawa-dono has a much deeper relationship with Shinkai-dono than we do, and has known him for longer, too. If we were to get his opinion, he may be able to shed some light on the current mysterious situation.

Uuu~… It’s a li’l frustrating to think that we’ll have to depend on him in the end…

He’s simply the right person to consult with for this situation, that is all. What someone else is unable to do, someone else will do. That is how a hero sentai accomplishes everything and ultimately wins.

All for one, and one for all! —right?
Everything we’ve been through since spring has taken a huge toll on us, but I wanna believe that those fundamental parts of our unit haven’t changed.

Chapter 6


    At the same time, deep within the cave eroded by water…

……
(…? it is kind of noisy Out there, isn&#39;t it~?)
(you should not do that~ you cannot make a Ruckus around a Sacred place—)
(—hmm~? are these Voices coming from the children in my ryuseitai…?)
(i told them to Watch over the area properly…)
(but they have not been following my Instructions at all lately. is this the Rumored rebellious Phase…?)
(that is the sprout of one’s Independence… to become a Mature adult.)
(it reminds me of the past… i was just like them When i was their age—)
(……?)
(i… i hear a strange Noise. it sounds as if something is going to break…)
(is someone playing Soldiers again somewhere?)
(you shouldn’t do that, either. even if it is just for Fun, there will be times you can’t get away with that as an Excuse.)
(ahh, i don’t have any choice, do i~? i have to stop him.)
(that Child would listen to Whatever i say, after all. unlike the children from my unit, he has yet to enter his Rebellious phase—)


Please listen to us, Kanzaki-dono! You are not allowed to go beyond here! It’s off-limits!

Ahh! Move at once, you scoundrels! By what authority do you stand in my way!?

W-w-w-we don&#39;t have any authority here! But the public’s not allowed beyond that point — it says so in the guidebook!

Such a thing means nothing to me! As Hasumi-dono would say: if the law obstructs your path, then change it! Send me the lord of the land, and I will personally force him to bend the law!

Isn’t that kinda insane!? Midori-kun, don&#39;t just stand there and watch — help us stop Kanzaki-senpai!

Hell no… I’m terrified… I don&#39;t wanna get near someone waving around a real sword…

I-It’s safe to get near Kanzaki-dono! He would never do anything to hurt anyone!

Nu-uh… Just seeing him wielding that sword is terrifying; I can feel the agonizing pain inflicting on me already… How are you guys even standing near him without fear…?

I know the sort of person Kanzaki-dono is, that’s why!

If I use my karate moves here, I could at least buy us more time, if nothing else…!

Um, you don&#39;t have to risk yourself over this, do you…? Just leave him be… Why do we even need to care what happens to him…?

Takamine is right! The both of you, stay back! You will only get hurt!

Ah! He does know my name…♪

Of course! Kanzaki-dono is an upperclassman worthy of respect! He’s kindhearted to those younger than him, and he’s always looking out for us!
That&#39;s exactly why I can’t just stand by and watch such a wonderful person go astray right before me!

Exactly! Ooooh!! We’re not lettin’ you through even if we die tryin’!!

Nooo, don’t lump me in that “we” — I don’t wanna be involved with all this dumb stuff… Why’s Ryuseitai always like this…?
(Not lately, though… Which means that this is more like the old Ryuseitai I love so much—)

Ahh, enough! Begone at once! I have no time to dabble with you!

I&#39;m goin’ nowhere! I won&#39;t budge ‘til you gimme a reason that makes sense to me!

Come on, Midori-kun! It&#39;s time for the specialty you demonstrated in MDM![1]

No no no, absolutely no way! “Takamine Barricade” is powerless against an opponent with an actual weapon!

—behave.

…!?
(…Curses! I was so preoccupied with the Ryuseitai juniors that I did not notice Shinkai-dono approaching from behind!)
(Did they plan this all along and dared to make a fool of themselves…!?)

Agh, you freaked me out!!

You always appear so abruptly, Shinkai-dono!

Even though he’s big… for some reason he has zero presence sometimes, like a ghost—

i am not a Ghost~ chiaki would Hate me if i was.

S-Shinkai-dono——

souma… so it really was you. the “so” in “souma” stood for “so noisy” all along, i see.

I-I apologize for the trouble I have caused! However, I have heard some extraordinary information from Morisawa-dono—

from chiaki? what has he been doing, and where? has he just been wandering the place and playing around, after throwing the Children’s care on me…?

I-I do not believe that gentleman is playing around… But more importantly, um, this is extremely difficult to ask, but—
Is it true that you have been enshrined as a god again!?

hawa…?

Chapter 7

    Around an hour later…

Huff, huff…! W-We&#39;ve finally made it!
Ugh, Kanzaki took off so suddenly that I didn’t even have time to react — And why to this remote island, anyway!? I’m glad I had him install a GPS app just in case any of us got lost, because it would be a disaster if we got separated during this trip!

Heheh, it’s pretty remarkable that technology has advanced to the extent that signals can reach even a remote island this far out.
I heard that back in the days of flip-phones and such, if you went to a remote island or deep in the mountains, you would get no signal.

Yeah, I heard that our family temple was like that, among others. How do you even know that? Are you actually not of our generation or something?

No, I learned about it from an old mystery novel.

Oh yeah, you’re the type to read books, aren’t you?

Fuhaha! Reading is energy for the mind, after all! ☆

…Hey, enough chit-chat. None of that matters right now. We needa find Kanzaki. He wasn’t acting like he normally would, and it’s worryin’.

I’m more worried about you.

Mhm, I agree… Are you alright, Kiryu? Maybe you should’ve stayed back at the restaurant…
The boat ride to get here has left you looking like you’re about to die again.

Shut it. I wouldn’t have become a delinquent if I cared to think about shit like that.

Kiryu, let me support you by the shoulder. Good grief, you’re always so reckless…♪

Whenever I&#39;m in bad shape, Hasumi gets unbearably gentle — it creeps me out.

I think he just likes to take care of a vulnerable kid, or maybe it’s just engraved in his instincts to do so. Hasumi and Tenshouin have known each other since childhood, after all.

His existence has nothing to do with my development.

No way he doesn’t, dude… What are you, a teenager who gets embarrassed by people knowing that you’re close to your family?

He&#39;s not family. I’m simply subjected to the misfortune of being stuck in an undesirable yet inseparable relationship.

Doesn’t change the fact it’s a relationship, even if it’s a “misfortune”. I honestly envy ya, Hasumi. I’m still so haunted by The War days, that me and Itsuki don’t—
Hmm?

What’s wrong, Kiryu?

Look over there. The hell is that…?

Hmm!? Did a kaijuu appear from the ocean!? Maybe King Caesar[2]…!? ☆

What on earth do you see Okinawa as?

repent of your Deeds! repent of your Deeds!

I repent! I repent!

What the hell…!?

Hmm… From the looks of it, it seems that Kanata is suspending Kanzaki-kun from a tree and showering him with seaweed — I think he has wakame seaweed in his hand.

That still doesn’t explain anything.

What the hell, is this some kinda religious ceremony or somethin’…?

It’s not right to conclude that something you don&#39;t know must be “related to religion”, without ever trying to deepen your understanding of it, Kiryu!
All the religious people in the world must’ve suffered from such a lack of sympathy, you know! Don&#39;t you agree, Hasumi!?

Um, I wouldn’t really…

say you’re Sorry! say you’re Sorry!

I’m sorry! I’m sorry!

Ah! Morisawa-dono, Hasumi-dono, and Kiryu-dono! You’ve all finally arrived! Please explain to us what&#39;s going on here~!

I wouldn’t know, either. We aren’t divine beings who know everything happening in the universe.

I&#39;d rather ask you guys the same question: What’s happening here…?

W-We really don’t have a clue! Kanzaki-senpai appeared outta nowhere, and then Shinkai-senpai also appeared outta nowhere…!?

Calm down, Tetsu. You&#39;re a mess when you try to think in words, so take a deep breath and just move your body. It’ll work out better for you that way.

O-Ossu, roger that! You’re awesome, Taishou, you always get me every time! ☆

Nah, it’s just that I’m like that, too. Let the smart people figure out the hard stuff — Things usually work out better that way.


Ossu, understood! But unfortunately, nobody in Ryuseitai is smart!

You’re not wrong, but I’m shocked that you’d word it that way, Tetora-kun… I’m sorry… I’m so sorry for being an idiot…

N-No one is saying anything bad about you, Midori-kun! If anything, I&#39;m the idiot!

Huh, that so? Personally, I get the impression that you guys are always gettin’ in and out of trouble ‘cause you’re all just too obedient for your own good.

That doesn’t matter now! Stop this at once, Shinkai! Don’t commit such inhumane acts on my junior! This is unforgivable, do you hear!?

Nay! Do not stop him, Hasumi-dono — I am being punished because I want to be!

Ugh, nothing is making any sense! Just what is going on here…!?

Chapter 8


    Next morning. After waiting for the break of dawn — on the boat ride back to the mainland…

in short, there seems to have been some sort of unfortunate Mishap.

And what exactly do you mean by a mishap…?

hmm… i think everyone here knows that i am worshiped as a God in my Hometown.

Huh!? This is the first time I’m hearing this, though!?

eh? did i not Tell you about it properly?

I mean, you did tell us a story before, but it all sounded like some kinda folk tale. I thought you were just quoting a bunch of tokusatsu shows or somethin’ random like that.

Whaaa…? God? What do you mean…?

I remember hearing you say some stuff like that, though… But I just thought it was another one of those “our seniors are talking about something stupid again” moments, and didn’t really listen properly.

gosh… this is all because chiaki always talks about Dumb stuff. you should learn to do better.

Ah, um, okay. I guess the blame is once again on me for this too, huh.
But this is something to do with you personally, so I can&#39;t just go around spreading stories about it on my own, can I?

well, that is true. i was also afraid that if i told the truth, you would all hate me — that is why i could not Tell you all about it in detail.

W-We wouldn’t hate you, I promise!

Yeah… Morisawa-senpai sometimes makes me wanna hit him for legit reasons, and I don&#39;t think it would emotionally hurt him if I did, but…
I feel like if I ever did something that makes Shinkai-senpai sad, I’d probably regret it for the rest of my life…

Don&#39;t you think the difference in treatment is just awful, Akatsuki?

Fufu, perhaps it comes from a feeling of trust that you would laugh it off and forgive him no matter what he does.

Besides, you should reflect on yourself before blaming others, Shinkai. Do your Ryuseitai juniors really seem the type to become disillusioned by learning about your past?

i do not want to be Lectured by you, but…
while i understand the Feeling of only wanting to show the Best parts of yourself, and never wanting the version of you before Transformation to be seen…
…that would make us Distant from each other, wouldn’t it?
but… all of you hate God, don’t you?

Wha!? No, um, I’ve never really thought that deeply about religion, honestly…!?

still. everyone always avoids that Topic, don’t they? i know that we are the type of People that others would prefer avoiding.[3]
because we are something scary, something that is unfathomable — something like a Monster.
in this country, and in these times, God is the same as a Monster.
am i wrong? if not, then why is everyone so afraid of God?
why do you Pretend not to See it, like it is something dirty? why do you refuse to Speak about it?

R-Rather than being afraid, they are in awe of them. They respect them and keep their distance from them.

that is only you, isn’t it?

………

Oh yeah, by the way, I don’t really fully get it myself, but apparently Kanzaki was a member of the religious group that worships Shinkai as a god.
I think he had an important role or something — he was entrusted with performing a special ceremony only in times of emergency.

I believe there is a slight miswording there, but I am fine with it being understood as such.

Huh… U-Um, I dunno how to respond to that… It’s kind of an unexpected relationship in an unexpected way, or well, this is all pretty unexpected in general…

Oh, Midori-kun’s vocabulary has reverted to six year old level, too! Now the junior members of Ryuseitai are all matching.
…Well, that is the sort of joke I would love to make here, but I’ll leave it aside for now… This is a very serious topic you must listen carefully to — Shinkai-dono.
When I was younger, everyone used to look at me oddly whenever I spoke about ninjas. I could tell they didn’t know how to respond, so I tried to wave it all off and end the conversation there.
However… Everyone in Ryuseitai would always earnestly listen to what I had to say. It all began when Morisawa-dono heard me out—
Even when you didn’t understand me fully, you showed support and acceptance without ever rejecting me.
That’s why I shall do the exact same. I will listen to what you have to say seriously — and I know for a fact that we will accept it wholeheartedly.
So please, I hope that you will talk to us about everything properly, without brushing it off as a funny story. We would never ignore or ridicule you.

………

Sengoku deserves ten billion points for his deeds today.

Shinobu-kun is the championship winner.

He just said to talk seriously, so don’t respond like idiots.

Uuu, Tetora-kun called me an idiot again…

there, there~♪ don’t worry, tetora Loves you, okay?

Erm, should we excuse ourselves…?
Although, it’s hard to leave when we’re all on a boat.

It’s practically impossible. Kanzaki apparently could manage to swim across just fine, though. How the hell did he build the stamina to do that…

indeed, souma is very Good at swimming~♪

Why are you proud about that.

well, i just think it is Amazing when someone Can do something that i Cannot do myself.

Actually, how come you can’t swim despite being such a huge sea and fish lover?
You always just sat back and watched whenever we had swimming classes at school, didn’t ya?

that is because i would be able to run away if i could swim. if Fish could survive on Land, they would be even harder to Catch than they already are, don’t you think?
so that is the reason. it is simply much more Convenient for everyone that way.

………

Chapter 9


    Several hours later, at the ryokan for ES idols — Ryuseitai’s room…

………

………

………

—and so, to conclude… i was a God my whole life, but through my encounter with chiaki, i began to Live as a Human being.

Please don’t talk about it like it was only thanks to me.
I didn’t manage to do anything. The reason you were freed from the binds of your home was largely thanks to you and Mikejima-san.

it is because of chiaki that i was able to gain the Motivation to change. if i had not met you, i would probably still be Deep within the Ocean—

………

n-no one is reacting… did it make you all Uncomfortable, after all…?

N-No! It’s just, um, so absurd — Erm, no, I shouldn’t say that… I’m simply struggling to digest it a little. It sounds so unreal.

Yeah… Your world is entirely different to the kind I’ve lived as the son of a greengrocer…

But… that’s the truth, and nothing but the truth, right?

yes, it is. i am not Lying. i am very sorry that i was unable to Tell you about it properly for so long, everyone.
it is because on a general sense, my Upbringing does not affect my Idol activities. but, to be honest, i was also Afraid of telling the truth and having it out of the water.
after all, this is the world of Human beings.
it is Normal for things other than human beings to be considered Strange, to be Discriminated against, shunned, or kept away from this world.
even Tokusatsu shows that are meant to sing praises of Justice are like that.
i was afraid that you guys would think of me as an Eerie being. that things would not be the same ever again—
but… you cannot stay the Same forever. after all, i am not the God that is depicted in Legends.
even if only the form remains the Same as it was in the Past, the inside is always Changing. you can never stay the Same, can you?

That’s true. That’s why, while the agency’s order to return back to the same old Ryuseitai was utter nonsense, it’s also human instinct to be unwilling and afraid of change.
In the end, we have to grit our teeth through unreasonable circumstances, knowing there isn’t much else we can do about the situation… but still move forward without ever giving up.

That’s not something you should be saying, and it kinda peeves me off hearing it from you… It feels like you&#39;re just lecturing a spoiled kid who doesn&#39;t listen.
But at the same time… you’ve got a point. The worst thing you can do is to give up. Not everything’s gonna turn out the way you want it to, so you have to persevere, overcome, and move on.
It&#39;s tricky to do so right away, but that&#39;s also what I wanna do. Ossu!

It’s not “I”, it’s “we”, Tetora-kun.

Yeah! All for one, and one for all! We, Ryuseitai, are always of one mind!

You guys…☆

Gaaah!? Please don&#39;t hug me outta nowhere!
Just to let you know, nothing’s been resolved, ‘kay!? I just said something nice to brighten up the mood!

Heheh. Still, let&#39;s start from there.
We, Ryuseitai, will fight against the evil that is unreason.
Don’t worry. We will be able to achieve victory.

yes~♪ i have always felt that way, so i do not have any Worries about ryuseitai~
no matter how long this Painful situation continues, we will be Victorious so long as we can keep our Smiles at the end of the day.
that is why… i must first set Right the Accident caused by me this time around.

I don’t think it was caused by you, though. There seems to have been some sort of mix-up regarding the message that Sengoku sent me through HoldHands.
For some reason, I was given incorrect information that Kanata had been enshrined as a god by a local Okinawan religious group.
That misinformation was conveyed to everyone in Akatsuki from me, and so Kanzaki-kun acted rashly to hurry and confirm the truth — that&#39;s how we got here.

Hold on, why were you telling Akatsuki about private messages between us in the first place, Morisawa-senpai…?
You’re not spilling info about my private life to them as well, are you…?

Fear not, Takamine! I doubt that Akatsuki has any interest in you!

Hah? I mean I guess that’s true, but did you have to put it that way…?

Oh? Well, don’t you worry, Takamine! I’m extremely interested in you!

That’s just creepy. Please go die.

What else was I supposed to say here!?

Chapter 10
Alright, so… We began sharing information with Akatsuki after forming a common front.
At first, I was the one who was asked to be the mediator, but this time around, Morisawa-dono was much more convenient for the role, so I requested that he do it in my stead.

Yup! I was Ninja-man, who went around Okinawa gathering information and passing it on to the right people!

Ninja-man! That’s so cool…☆

I really don’t get what’s to be excited about…
But, huh, so that’s how we ended up with an “unfortunate mishap”?
Kanzaki-senpai believed in the weird info he was given, and then started acting weird, himself… But why did he react so irrationally in the first place?
I mean, if you told me the same thing, I would’ve just been like, “Enshrined as a god? What’re you even on about?”

yes, of course you would. but souma cannot Ignore such Information.
if i were to return back to being a God, he would be in Trouble.

What do you mean by trouble?
I’m sorry that I suck at understanding stuff! I did hear that Kanzaki-senpai was uh, like, a worshiper of your religion, or somethin’…?

it is a bit Off to merely say that he is a Worshiper. he comes from a Lineage that holds a particular Duty.
when i — a God — go mad, he must Conceal it at once.

Conceal? Do you mean manipulation and concealment of information?

no. what it means is that he must Kill.[4]

K-Ki…!?

that is why… souma must have been Distraught, thinking that i had returned to being a God. after all, now that i am a Human being—
he has been unable to carry out his Duty to “slice god into pieces”. because it is not a Human being that he should slice, but God.
if he had one Last opportunity to Kill me, it would have been during the battle versus the sea god.
but… he lost his Chance then.
eventually, he no longer had any opportunity to ever carry out his Duty, but…
were i to ever become God again, he may have to Carry it out then.
because he was born in order to kill God in the off-chance that the worst happens.
his Reckless behavior must have come from being terrified of the thought that if i were to ever return to being a God again, that Day may truly come—
and so he swam across a long, long Distance to confirm the truth.
he is such a silly boy, don’t you think? he is like a little Child who had a scary nightmare.


but… to be honest, i was happy. if souma never Cared for me, he would not have Flinched for even a moment.
i am sure that he would have carried out his Duty like a Robot — without a flutter in his Heart.
he would have sliced me up like a Fish.
but… he was disheveled because of how much Care and love he had for me.
the mere Thought terrified him, enough so that he could no longer stand still.
when i think about those sincere Feelings of his, ahh—
i can’t help but think he is just so, so, soooooo adorable…♪

Hmm… It’s always hard to understand Shinkai-senpai whenever he speaks in long sentences, ‘cuz it&#39;s hard to pick up what he’s saying…
But in short, the incident today was just an unfortunate mishap, yeah? Kanzaki-senpai believed in the weird info he was given, and went a li’l nuts.

yes. there is no Truth in the idea that i have been enshrined as a God.
it is just that the local Religious people had said something that stuck out to me.
i thought that i should have a proper Talk with them, so i told you three to Stay put and watch over as i met with the Religious group. that is all.

You guys are doing it again, keeping us out of the loop—

n-no, that is not my intention. that area is a Sacred place, and normally no one but those Permitted can enter.
i was only allowed in because i received a Special permit. there was something i wanted to check first, and it could only be accessed deep within that Confined area—

By the way, confined areas refer to places that the general public is forbidden to enter.
Surprisingly, there are many places like that all over the country, and they are often sacred religious sites.

You sure know a lot, huh…?

Heh! My club member, Mayoi-dono, is an expert in all sorts of occult stories, so my knowledge of these things just naturally grows whenever we chat.

So even the stuff that perverted-looking guy talks about is suspicious too, huh…?

“Perverted-looking guy”!? M-Mayoi-dono is a good person, you know~!? Whenever I’m feeling down, he twists and turns in heavy breaths to make me laugh!

That’s exactly what I’m talking about.

Hmm… It seems that misinformation led to a series of misunderstandings and miscommunications, resulting in a strange accident…
If that were all it is, we could just brush it off as a silly mistake, but something doesn&#39;t feel right. For one thing, why did the message that Sengoku sent me contain such misleading information?

I-I didn’t write anything except, “I believe that Shinkai-dono had gone to meet and talk with people from a religious group.”
We were not sure what was going on because it came out of the blue, so I figured Morisawa-dono might have some idea about the situation, since you have known Shinkai-dono for a long time… That’s when I thought to ask you about it, in hopes we could get answers.
Wait, huh? I just looked at my phone, and sure enough, it says something about Shinkai-dono being enshrined as a god?
Ehh…? Did I truly write it like this…?

Hmm… I hope Sengoku is simply misremembering, and that he really did just slip and write a strange message.
Because if not, then this is an extremely grave situation.

What do you mean…?

I’m unsure what their intentions could be… But our phones were specifically provided by ES and are made to use for the corporation, so it’s possible that the message has been rewritten by someone from the outside.
Only ES is able to do that, as they’re the ones in charge of supplying the phones and managing the servers of HoldHands.
On top of that, the rewritten content was precisely the kind of thing that would cause Kanzaki-kun to act recklessly.
In other words… It&#39;s possible that someone in the upper management of ES, who knows us well and can even interfere with messages in HoldHands, attacked us with malicious intent.

attacked…?

Yeah. I could just be overthinking it, and with such a vaguely chosen alteration, I can’t fully pinpoint what they were trying to accomplish were we to rule it as an attack…
It could simply be nothing but a prank, but if it really was an attack all along, then we’re in deep trouble.
We are idols affiliated with ES. If that ES has bared its fangs toward us with malicious intent, then this could unfold the most earth-shaking development yet.

Chapter 12


    The next day, at noon — At a sandy beach in Okinawa, during Ryuseitai and Akatsuki’s match…

—Mhm. Yeah, that’s why everything will be alright, Mikejima-san. It was all just an accident caused by an unfortunate misunderstanding.
I’m still concerned about where the misinformation came from, but we&#39;re taking the proper precautions.
Yep, I borrowed a phone from a local who should be out of ES&#39;s reach.
I’m also using a secure line to make the call with your mother’s help. I doubt even a powerhouse such as ES could interfere through this many safety measures.
They might be able to listen in, but they can&#39;t alter the audio. I hope so, at least. Your mother said something similar, too.
Huh? Why do I know your mother’s contact information? Oh! I was simply approached by her a long while back, when I was browsing around in a bookstore.
She greeted me politely, thanking me for getting along with her son and such, so we talked to each other about the books we liked.
After that, she felt tired from walking, so I offered that she rest at my house, and—
Hmm? “That’s how those two try to get you”? Woah, you’re talking about your parents like they’re strangers.
As I understand it, you don’t seem to have a good relationship with your family, but I still think you should drop by once in a while to reassure them.
Your parents seem to miss you and worry about you.
Even your sister regularly asks me if you’re doing alright.
Huh? Well, I often talk with your sister on a tokusatsu fan site, so that’s how I know… She seems to be a fan of the villains in the shows, both monsters and bad guys alike.

Hey, we’re still workin’, Morisawa. Why’re you chattin’ about random stuff on the phone?

Ohh, no, I was having a serious call about something, actually.
I thought I should let Mikejima-san know about what happened concerning what we thought was Kanata’s religion, and such.
We’d only call for more trouble if we had even more unwanted fabrications and misunderstandings, so I tried to contact him through a secure method.

Huh. Well, I guess that is pretty important to do when it comes to Shinkai’s religion. I mean, didja see how reckless Kanzaki was? If Mikejima got involved somehow, he’d have gone even more berserk.

Yeah, it feels like Mikejima-san’s been on a constant rampage lately. I’m worried about him…
Even during the SS qualifying rounds, it seems that he’s been displaying quite a lot of inexplicable, problematic behavior.

I bet it’s been a blast for him though; it’s really just like him to go off like that. But I guess it’s also just like those brainless biker gangs who drive through highways like maniacs with their customized motorbikes.
Let him know that we don’t really have the right to stop him or anythin’, but if it gets real nasty, we’re willin’ to do what it takes to stick our foot in and help.

Hahaha. He says, “That’s my line.”

Haah? Tell him, “Who the hell do you think we are? As if we’ll ever ask for your help.”

Um, wouldn’t it just be easier to talk to each other directly at this point…!? Why am I still acting as a middleman!?

Haha, some things are harder to say in person. Cut us some slack, will ya?

That’s so complicated… But I guess that’s just how guys are…
Anyway, it’s true that it’s a bad look for me to be on the phone while working. I&#39;ve told you everything you need to know, so let&#39;s end the call here.
Mhm, mhm… I don’t know where you are nor what you’re doing right now, but I wish you the best of luck. We’re always cheering for you!
Yeah, we&#39;ll also do our best in our silly little “Ryuseitai VS Akatsuki” fishing showdown~♪
Huh? “Why’re you guys partaking in a dumb showdown like that”? I think it&#39;s nice and peaceful, though!
And that means — we ended up with this decision because everyone preferred peace over war.

Chapter 13
Gentlemen, feast your eyes on this!


This is a secret technique of the Kanzaki blade style: Dance of Divine Slicing[5]…!

Ohhh~♪ That’s awesome! The fish we caught was cut apart perfectly!

Not only that, but the sliced fish dropped on the plate in such a neat and flawless manner! It looks delicious~♪

Um, all I feel is fear watching a blade slice stuff apart this up-close… I envy you two… You’re able to enjoy this with so much innocence…

What&#39;s the matter, Takamine? You don’t look well. Are you seasick like Kiryu?

Huh? Ahh, no, um, I&#39;m always like this, though…?

Oh, I see. Right, that makes sense. Sorry, obviously there’d be people out there who are, by default, not the energetic type.
Forcing those types of people to “cheer up” or “do their best” would be the same as abuse, wouldn’t it?

Huh? Uh, yes? That’s true…?
(I had no idea that Hasumi-senpai can be as persistent as Morisawa-senpai… We barely had anything to do with Akatsuki outside of Scroll of the Elements, so—)

fufu. we have a bit of history between us and akatsuki, after all. perhaps that made us Avoid each other.

Can you please not read my mind!?

i cannot read your Mind~ i am not a God, after all.
even so, i have been with All of you for a looong time, so i can at least perceive what you are Thinking.

Um, okay… I still dunno anything about you though, Shinkai-senpai…
I don&#39;t even know why us Ryuseitai and the members of Akatsuki have decided to compete through fishing…

There are a few complex reasons for that, Takamine.

W-Why’s everyone talking to me all of a sudden…? Uuu, I thought I’d finally get to spend my time in peace and quiet now that Morisawa-senpai isn’t anywhere nearby…

Fufu, Morisawa-dono is away from everyone in Ryuseitai again due to either his order or secret order, correct?

Hah… Apparently he has to spend a certain amount of time far away from our sight…
Fine with me, though… since he’s always so overbearing… I hope his order stays even after SS is over—

Fufu, you should not utter such insincere statements such as that. Do not underestimate the power of the spoken word.
Nonetheless, though Morisawa-dono constantly needs to separate from his members, I am grateful that it allows him to take care of Kiryu-dono, as he continues to be in poor health.
He could die if he boards a ship once more. I was worried about him.

Is Taishou gonna be okay…?

Of course. You know his strength better than anyone — Nagumo.

Ossu, I do. But no matter how strong someone is, there’s still times when they lose their energy or get into bad shape. I’m worried ‘bout him.

And I, as well. However, we mustn’t allow ourselves to be caught up by our emotions.
Rather, showing him that we are in good spirits shall be the greatest comfort to him.
Perhaps this is blunt, but I must say it: For Kiryu-dono’s sake, you should cheer up.
Here, eat some fish. Fish is nourishing.

Ossu, I appreciate it. I’ll dig in!

(Ahh… Seeing that sword on Kanzaki-senpai gives off a terrifying impression of him, but he’s a good person like any other regular person.)
(Hasumi-senpai seems to be a good person, too… He didn’t have any ulterior motive earlier, he would’ve talked to anyone who was left out of the conversation, or looked down in the dumps.)
(Was I just being overly self-conscious by thinking they were paying too much attention to me…? Ugh, I’m such an embarrassment…)


fufu. this is truly so Peaceful and Relaxing~♪
i am so glad that everyone in akatsuki accepted our Idea~

There is no reason to refuse it. Our interests are aligned, are they not, Kanzaki?

Ahh, yes, indeed. Hasumi-dono was not the one to accept the idea; rather, it was I who decided that we side with Ryuseitai’s proposal.

you two are quite Troublesome this Time around, aren’t you…?

Indeed, and it is all a result of our orders.  …Incidentally, what order were you given, Shinkai-dono?

eh~? you know i cannot answer that, right?

Yeah, that’s how the order works, after all.

yes. at the very least, i will let you Know that i am fulfilling my Order so far. there is no Need to worry.

I&#39;m not particularly worried. When it comes down to it, you’re simply another unit among many, and in SS, we’re rivals competing for the top spot.

fufufu. i am not really interested in becoming the Best, though.
were i to reach the Top, i would simply feel lonely all by Myself up there.

It sounds profoundly deep when uttered by you, Shinkai-dono.

that is because the Deep sea[6] has strong Water pressure~♪
that is why i was going to be Fine. i am used to harsh Environments.
but, the same cannot be said about everyone else. if you continue to give them Stress, they will break.
that is why… we are venting off our Frustrations in this way, yes?

Chapter 14
Your explanation is difficult to understand, Shinkai.

Mm, you see… Originally, we were to continue battling one another within Okinawa.
We were supposed to continuously prey on other units through live battles.

Yeah, and for every victory, we can loot all the SSL$ that belonged to our opponents.
I don&#39;t know how it is in other areas, but that’s the rule here in Okinawa.

yes… that is why everyone was repeatedly performing live battles; it was to make a Quick profit in ss-l-dollars.

Yeah, especially since you could turn the tables if you manage to overpower the strong ones who’re making a lot of money. That sounds nice on paper, but personally, I’m not fond of the idea — it feels as though it encourages people to crush and kill each other.
However, I suppose ES’s plan was to show the power of their agencies in this area, by having the ES idols, who are accustomed with the DreamFes system, wipe the floor with the idols here.

Hmm… Thus, the local Okinawan idols and others alike were sacrificed for this purpose?

That’s just my guess. I’m sure that this is happening not only in Okinawa, but all over the country. ES is trying to prove their righteousness and strength with these aggressive methods.
SS is nothing but a promotion by ES and intended for ES. It’s an unreasonably massive charade, in which only ES can win.  …Though, perhaps I’m distrusting them a little too much by assuming as such.
I suppose if there is one saving grace, it’s that even if you lose the battle, you won’t die — you only forfeit your SSL$.
Were this a real war of life or death, it would be nauseatingly wicked.
But thankfully, the losers of the live battle don’t lose their qualification to participate in the qualifying rounds, and they can continue to earn money through their idol activities.

However, it is still a long, rigorous road. I cannot speak for the energetic and hopelessly optimistic adolescents, but our agency&#39;s veterans do not have the fighting spirit.
That is precisely why everyone was hastily repeatedly performing live battles.
In fighting, there are winners and losers — within the losers, hatred is born, and in the winners, fear of retaliation or loss of property is born.
In this way, negative emotions multiply and chain together, causing one conflict after another.
And this ruthless battlefield within Okinawa is precisely the hell that emerged from these repeated events.

Hmph. A war that gets bogged down like that is the worst kind of war. That’s exactly why in The War era, we sought speed and wanted short term battles.
Also, because there was the possibility that Eichi would die if it dragged on for too long.

please do not mention Old stories of the War days at every opportunity you get. they are Stories that do not make anyone Happy.
instead of lamenting about the Past, let&#39;s think about the Future. after all, we can make That shine with our Efforts.

I suppose we see things with a different perspective, then. If we don&#39;t learn from the past and its history, we’re doomed to repeat the same tragedy.

even though both the Characters involved and the Script are different this time?
you are looking Down on Human beings a little too much, temple guy.

………

Fufu. However, the events in Okinawa were somehow reminiscent of The War era — especially around the time of the Battle versus the Sea God.
Constant wars, jaded people, and the scent of religion creeping in… In those war days, I could do little but watch from the sidelines.
However, the times have changed. I do not mean to say this in a haughty manner, but I am now even in a position to make decisions within Akatsuki.
I shall make the most of what I have gained, and use it to bring about the future I desire.

yes, i intend to do the same.
i will not fulfill someone else’s Wish, but my own Desire.
that is why we have the Fishing contest. the team who catches the most Fish wins…♪

That still doesn’t explain how we got here. Are you an alien or what? Speak in a way I can understand.

fufu. this time, instead of a live battle, we will fight through a peaceful Method.
since it is not a live battle, even if we lose, we will not lose our ss-l-dollars on top of that.
no one will be hurt, and nothing will be lost—
we will have a Battle like one from a Variety show, as if it is a Game. hopefully, one that can put a Smile on anyone with Unease in their hearts.
and we will be deciding the Rules for this Battle.

Indeed. We ignore rules that we are not fond of, and operate under our own as long as they comply with our principles. That is the way we Akatsuki — or rather, Hasumi-dono — operate.
I wish to follow in Hasumi-dono’s footsteps — Not because Hasumi-dono ordered me to do so, but because it is as I desire.

Hrm… Well, it is true that it’s not like us to dance around according to rules laid down by others.

That sounds kinda like what Trickstar’d say.

Ahh, so that’s why it sounded so familiar.

Hmph. We were their first obstacle, after all. And we aren’t so stupid as to fail to learn anything from the opponents we battled to our last breath.

Indeed. It may also be due to the influence of Anzu-dono, who is a Trickstar member, as well.
In past days, she used to be the only sun in Yumenosaki, and we had performed our idol activities under her light for a long time.
How could we not be influenced by her?

yes. she Loves everyone so much — that is why she would never want us to crush or kill each other.
we are also very fond of all the Idol activities that have been Produced by her.
so surely no one would be interested in having War battles after all that — right, anzu-san?

Speaking of which, I haven’t seen her around since the qualifying rounds started. I wonder what she’s doing right now…

Hm, the qualifying rounds are being held at the same time all over the country, so I don’t believe she can afford to travel to every site.
She may likely be at the ES building, performing her job mainly through the Internet.

Yeah, that makes sense… It’d be way weirder if she could appear anywhere in the country and do her job perfectly.

yes, i believe so. that would be Impossible for anyone other than God.
it is not right to Expect that from a Human being, as they are not God.

Indeed. Even though we are far away and unable to speak directly to each other, we have accumulated within ourselves everything we have gained from her thus far.
Let us proudly display it, as it shines brilliantly from within!
Anzu-dono! We are happily performing our idol activities here in the far south today!

Content Warning: Emetophobia


    Location: Tropical Island Sandy Beach



    Around an hour later…

That’s enough!
No wrongdoer can escape their just dues! No evil shall prosper for as long as we, Ryuseitai, exist!
The evil deed you’re all committing is violence! The desire to shed blood and hurt one another to attain something!
You can’t allow such evil to take control of you! You all need to stop fighting each other!
Why do you think we have a mouth to speak, a heart to feel, and words to express ourselves with? It’s so you can talk it out with your foe and get along with one another!


Morisawa.

Oooh, Hasumi! I see Kiryu and Kanzaki-kun, too! All of Akatsuki are here, huh!?
Okinawa is filled with idols I’ve never interacted with before, so I’m relieved to see familiar faces~♪

You can leave that aside for a moment — I’d like to know what you’re doing here.

Why, to save you all, of course!
There’s a horrible life-or-death battle occurring in Okinawa! Actually, it wouldn’t be an exaggeration to say that a war is breaking out!
But you guys wouldn’t have known that due to your delayed arrival, so I was worried that you fell victim to the other idols!

Hmm… So the people who attempted to assault us really were nothing but idols, huh.
It seems my assumption was correct. I suspected that they were regular people simply pretending to be a threat, raising their microphones up high as if they were weapons.

They may just be idols, but believe me when I say the Okinawa idol groups are immensely powerful! They’ll wipe you out if you aren’t careful!
And so, although we aren’t the strongest unit out there — as fellow brethren from the same company, we’ll assist y—

That won’t be necessary.
We’ve defeated all the idols that were foolish enough to challenge us.

Woah, that quickly!? Incredible! I see your procedures are as precise and swift as usual! But if possible, I would have rather you waited for the heroes of justice to come to the rescue, y’know!?

We don’t need your assistance. We aren’t weaklings who’d fall prey to evil, and neither are we in a position capable of asking for help from “heroes of justice”.

No, you’re mistaken! Mutual understanding is all you need for your friendship to blossom with someone, even if they’re a god! And since we’re friends, there’s no reason why I can’t save you!

Hmph, that is simply how you feel. It’s because you always take action based on your own feelings that it’s impossible for me to trust you so-called “heroes of justice”.
You all judge others based on emotions alone — Who do you think you are? A god?[1]

Yo, chill… Drop the manga refs for a sec, we need a rundown of what’s goin’ on.
It’s frustratin’ that we’re getting caught up in this mess without even knowin’ why.
You seem to know a thing or two, Morisawa. Couldja tell us the hell’s goin’ on here?

Oooh, Kiryu! I was worried you’d be feeling unwell, but you seem to be doing alright! I’m so glad!
The boat ride must have been rough, wasn’t it? You can’t handle vehicles all too well, so I was worried that you’d feel too sick to stand!

Haha… Yeah, it’s actually takin’ all my effort to keep myself from droppin’ dead.
But considerin’ we accepted their challenge and all, I’m basically onstage right now as an idol.
I can’t be lookin’ all pathetic in front of all these other people, so I’m pushin’ myself through this as much as I can.


Haha, Hasumi-dono and I alone were sufficient enough to rout such miniscule foes.

Yeah, we would have taken their challenge and won it just fine even if Kiryu weren’t here. Need I remind you that we’re none other than Akatsuki?

That’s pretty terrifying… I thought you guys were more obedient lately, but you really are a combative group…
W-Well, either way! You need to know what’s going on, right? You’re probably tired from your long trip, so let’s head over to the ryokan ES booked—

Hmm… Does this perchance mean that you have come to collect us? I understand well now — I could not deduce the purpose behind your actions at first, due to your verbose manner of speaking.

I suppose we’re the last people who should be saying that, though.

Actually, Morisawa, are there any tasty restaurants nearby?
Not only did I empty my stomach from all the nausea, but needin’ to perform without any breaks in between really took me out… I’m seriously all outta gas.

Yeah, you look really pale, Kiryu… I’m worried.
Alright then. We aren’t situated at a tourist hotspot, and I’m not from here either, so I don’t have any restaurants in mind, but—
I’ll try searching for something on my phone. Nagumo has been itching to see you for a while, so I’ll call over my comrades, as well.

Haha… I don’t really want Tetsu seein’ me like this.

(Hm… Though I am not quite clear on what is happening, it appears that we have solved this matter without any problems.)
(However… Who were those idols that tried to assault us? Their bloodthirsty presence reminded me of that “evil,” but—)
(Surely, that must not be the case…?)

Chapter 4

    Location: Okinawa Restaurant



    Another hour or so passes…

Taishou~!! Hasumi-senpai, Kanzaki-senpai! You must’ve had a long trip, so please rest for now! Ossu!
I’m so sorry that we couldn’t come see you! We didn’t have any time to spare ‘cuz we’ve been fighting with the local idols day in and out—

Actually, it’s the ES idols that have been the biggest pain… They keep harassing us over the simplest things…
But I doubt the Akatsuki members would do anything lame like that, so we should be able to take it easy, hopefully…

It doesn’t feel right to call it harassment, in my opinion. I feel as though it was just bad timing on both sides — like an unfortunate accident.


Your soul is so pure, Shinobu-kun… I hope you stay that way forever…

Ossu, he sure is. Shinobu-kun really holds Ryuseitai’s moral values, and he&#39;s the hope of ES.

Heh! And I happen to be the strongest ninja in the idol industry…☆

Haha, you Ryuseitai kiddos are as energetic as ever, huh?

That’s my only strong point, after all! I got bucket loads of energy in me~!
(Whispering) ……It’s only ‘cuz Morisawa-senpai returned back to being the leader again, so we’ve got a lotta time to spare now that he takes care of everything for us involving the unit.

(Whispering) It’s better this way, now we can relax, at least… I don’t wanna work hard…

? What are you two whispering to each other about? Let me take part, too!

Nu-uh… I refuse to let anything corrupt you… I’ll be the one to protect you, Shinobu-kun…

Why have you been acting so odd lately, Midori-kun!?

hello, everyone~! the Food is ready, so please be behave and take a Seat~

Mhm! You’re free to chat while you eat, but don’t move around too much! We can’t have any dirt falling into our food!

Why’re you seniors serving the table, even though we’re the ones who should be doing that?

Actually, why are you two the ones bringing the food in the first place, instead of the staff? Is this restaurant owned by a relative of yours?

No, not at all, I don’t even know this place! I just heard the owner is an old man with a strained back, so we figured it’s best if we carry the food over by ourselves!

yes, and since there are many People at this table, it would have been Difficult for one person to carry Everything.

Huh, aight. You’re all such good boys as always, arent’cha? I heard a lotta harsh stuff happened to you guys, so it wouldn’t have been surprisin’ if it made one of ya snap a li’l.

Ahaha, nothing’ll change by sulking, that’s all.

………

alright, okaaay~ time to set up the Table. temple guy, you cannot eat Meat or fish, right? this Salad is for you~♪

My family isn’t that strict, actually. But sea grapes make me feel like we’re really in Okinawa, so I’m sort of happy to have some.

Ah, Shinkai-dono… My deepest apologies, but I cannot eat fish.


……!?

Wha—!? W-Why do you look like a mother who has lost her beloved child…?

souma…? what did you just say…?
you cannot eat Fish? i don’t understand! you are not the souma i know! you must be an imposter…!

Hehe, characters switching places and hero imposters are mostly just common tropes in tokusatsu, though.

you, temple guy! you Converted our souma to your religion, didn’t you?
you gave him a taste of delicious Veggies, until his Body could no longer stand the taste of Fish…!

Don’t throw the blame on me.

Um, this has naught to do with Hasumi-dono, but rather, erm, that I—

you are not the same anymore, are you… i’m so sad…
okinawa is a place brimming with Seafood, so i was really looking forward to talking to you about all kinds of Fish…

Ahh, please do not make such a somber face! This is simply an unavoidable matter — I assure you that I have not grown to hate fish…!!

Did we come all the way here to Okinawa to watch a pseudo-lover&#39;s quarrel happen before our very eyes?

Haha, it’s real nice seeing this energy, actually. It’s bringin’ me back to our Yumenosaki days.

Chapter 5

    A few minutes later — Akatsuki and Ryuseitai are having a discussion after their meal…

Hmm, I see. I understand what’s happening in Okinawa now. Or rather, the peculiarities laid down in this prefecture.

Ossu. I’m sorry if I didn’t explain stuff very well.

I don’t mind. Morisawa has a tendency to see everything in a good light far more than necessary, so I wanted an impartial explanation from someone else.
You’re much better at explaining things than he is for this reason.

Ahaha… To be honest, I still freeze up a li’l when I’m talking to you, Hasumi-senpai. I always get reminded of the time I was rejected from Akatsuki…
But well, the only reason I’m the one explaining things right now is ‘cuz Morisawa-senpai is helping Taishou get back to the inn, since he wasn’t feeling well.

Like I said, I don’t mind that. I’m tired enough as it is, Morisawa would only tire me further.

hmph… you sure do treat chiaki Harshly, temple guy.

It’s nothing compared to you.
…Let’s get back on topic. I’d rather discuss the current situation in Okinawa than Morisawa.
We don’t know anything about what’s going on because we’ve only just arrived here.

Ossu, aight, so… Based on the official broadcasts of SS and the information circulating on HoldHands from ES—
It sounds like the atmosphere or, rather, the characteristics of the qualifying rounds are super different between regions.

Indeed, it seems so. Depending on the region, you may end up trapped in a virtual space, an amusement park, a desert, a jungle, or—[2]

Why are there so many variations of getting trapped inside somewhere…?

Hehe, we can’t step out of Okinawa during the qualifying rounds, so in a way, you could say that we’re confined to this area too.

Don’t explain this situation as if we’re trapped in some sealed room for no reason. That makes it sound like a random excuse a mystery writer came up with just because they couldn’t think up a clever trick.

I don’t even know what half those words mean…
Anyway, Okinawa is pretty simplistic compared to areas like the jungle or whatever—
To put it simply, it’s brutal out here.

Thank you for the clear expression. Specifically, there seems to be a lot of live battles happening around the region.

Ossu, that’s basically all you’ll ever see here.

Indeed. We arrived here much earlier than Akatsuki did, but even we were challenged to a battle the moment we exited the plane.
We managed to overcome it, but we were then challenged by all sorts of idols at every opportunity right after… I’m pretty fed up with it, to tell you the truth.

Hm, so essentially, we’ll be challenged to a match the moment we start moving. That sounds just like Pokemon.

You know about Pokemon, Hasumi-dono!?


Is that a problem…?

Ah, no… But the more I talk to you, the more I realize you’re someone I could get along with!

Haha, I would more say it is you who is affable no matter who you speak to, Sengoku.
Although, Ryuseitai is predominantly more soft-hearted compared to Akatsuki — In other words, it feels relaxing to intermingle with you. I believe that your group is remarkably unsuitable for such a ferocious atmosphere.

Mm~ Thing is, Yumenosaki was like that too, so we are familiar with it.
But Morisaw—Taichou doesn&#39;t like seeing people crush each other, so he wants to put an end to those conflicts.
He’s the current leader of Ryuseitai, so we’ve been basically running around with him and telling everyone to stop fighting.

Hmm, that is just like Morisawa-dono. He is always working hard to fulfill his duty for the sake of maintaining peace.
He is an honorable man who loves peace and cherishes people. You have truly been blessed with a wonderful predecessor, Sengoku, Nagumo.

………

(That’s odd, he didn’t mention my name…)
(Well, to be fair, I’ve barely talked to Kanzaki-senpai before, so I would’ve been more confused if he did speak to me like we’re friends, but still…)

midori? is something the matter? if you are still hungry, would you like to eat the Fish that was meant for that Traitor souma, since he did not bother to finish his plate?

No, I’m good… I only get bigger with every bite I take… and I don’t really like the sight of a dead fish’s eyes…

i knew you would say that, so i have prepared sliced up Sashimi as an alternative~♪

Wait a moment, please refrain from calling me a traitor, Shinkai-dono! This is an inevitable matter — I swear to you that my heart has always been one with the Marine Life Club!

hmph, you cannot fool me with flattery…

I always think this, but Shinkai really is harsh to specifically only Kanzaki, isn’t he… Ah, wait, he’s harsh to Mikejima, too — I suppose he’s much more haughty with the people he’s close to.

Shinkai-dono is always kind to us, though…?

fufufu, that is because everyone in ryuseitai are Good kids~♪
…you are always being such Good kids, but still do not get rewarded with anything… it is such a Pity.

Ahhh! Do not let such frustration build up inside of you, Shinkai-dono! Here, eat the seafood I cannot consume!

the one who is Stressing me out the most is you, souma. you traitor… you deserve death for your treachery…

Uuu, I assure you that it is not what you think it is, Shinkai-dono! I… I simply…!?

…Quit bullying our kid so much, Shinkai.

i am not Bullying anyone~ heroes never do that.

Chapter 6
That aside, it’s crucial that we think about what to do from here on out in Okinawa, considering it seems to be an even more ruthless battlefield than rumored. I assume you guys will simply do whatever Morisawa intends, as he’s your leader.
However, the idols that have been constantly competing against each other aren’t necessarily breaking any rules, are they? Do you even have the right to stop them?

Uuu… I cannot say you’re wrong about that, but…

I suppose “heroes of justice” have always been known for this kind of thing since the olden times, but to be frank, you’re nothing but a bunch of rebels sacrificing yourselves to your own feelings rather than the rules of society.
We’re nothing like you. If the situation in Okinawa is a hell swirling with war, then so be it. We will simply adapt to it, destroy the hordes of enemies, and move forward.
We’re well-acquainted with live battles, as it’s our field of expertise. The current turmoil actually works in our favor.

Indeed. After all, Hasumi-dono along with the previous student council were the ones who created the live battle — the DreamFes system.
It is a weapon we are quite familiar with utilizing.
As proof of this, we effortlessly won the battle we were provoked into earlier. My wording may be a bit rude, but our opponents were so miniscule that I was rather worried for their safety.

That’s basically what you can expect from the local idols here, to be honest…
It’s why you’ll only ever hear stories about ES idols kicking the crap out of them…

Oh, that is a bit of a surprise. We do not have any ties to the local area, and neither are we well-known here—
Thus, I had thought that we would be at a disadvantage compared to the local idols that have acquired their own fanbase in this region.
After all, I assume the majority of the audience that come to watch the performances would be local ones.

That doesn’t seem to be the case here, actually. Okinawa has always had a smaller population of local people compared to other prefectures.
So you will notice that there are far more tourists who’ve crowded around places uninvited purely to watch SS — an amount large enough to stand out in the crowd.
I believe the majority of the audience for the SS qualifying rounds are from outside the prefecture.

Yeah… From what I’ve noticed from the few times we were on stage, there aren’t many local idol fans in the audience…
It’s mostly just tourists and not much of anyone else…

It’s like, they’re here to cheer for the qualifying rounds, but also go sightseeing while they’re at it. I guess the locals wouldn&#39;t say no to more tourists in the area, but, man…
Being surrounded in every corner and having my pictures taken by ‘em makes me feel like I&#39;m some kinda exotic Okinawan animal.

fufufu~, i am pretty Used to that feeling, though~

You do manage an aquarium, after all.

…However, there is something I am not fully comprehending.
According to the information we’ve received, Okinawa is a ruthless battlefield filled with many local powerhouses, and yet, the only conspicuous groups are ones originating from outside the prefecture.

I’m not sure how credible that information is, though. It’s merely information we received beforehand from ES through HoldHands.
We won&#39;t know how true that really is until we properly confirm it with our own two eyes.
For now, it appears to me that ES is trying to manipulate us by deliberately twisting the information they provide us.

Huh, I suppose I should have expected as much insight from Nito&#39;s assistant. So you know a thing or two on how to utilize information?

Oh no, no! My skills are nothing compared to Nito-dono and Yuuki-dono—

I’ve been wondering this for a long while now, but is the Broadcasting Committee a spy organization or something…?

Anyway, what we&#39;re tryna say is that we don&#39;t wanna participate in fighting and crushing each other.
Okinawa is completely at war. We wanna put an end to it as soon as possible so that we can do our idol activities properly.
…I’m aware we probably don’t have the power to stop the fighting, but still—

It would honestly be impossible. You wouldn’t even make a ripple if you threw a pebble into the torrent. Though, I suppose it could be possible if Shinkai were to perform a miracle like a God—

Hm? What was that about Shinkai-dono?

Ah, you guys wouldn’t know, would you? Well, it was from before your time.
That having been said, the scale of the battle, the people involved, and everything else — all of it is much different from the Battle versus the Sea God[3], and neither do I think another miracle could come about like it did then.
And we aren’t so wishy-washy as to wait idly, hoping for a miracle to happen. We&#39;re going to intervene in the war circulating in this region, and win every battle until we come out victorious in the qualifying rounds.

well, that is what you would expect from akatsuki, i suppose.

No, this is simply my personal opinion. Kanzaki will be the one to decide what we do.

Um, as I have inquired before, why do you continually redirect the decision-making onto me? I personally would prefer to follow your wishes…
Could this mean that Hasumi-dono really has been told to abide by some sort of inauspicious order…?

Chapter 7
Hmm, indeed, the orders… Troublesome doesn’t even begin to describe how I feel about them.

Oh, yeah, that’s why you haven’t been saying any ninja terms, or uh, slang? during performances… Though I kinda like hearing you talk normally… It feels refreshing…

Yeah! It’s surprisingly cool to hear you talk that way!

While I’m happy to hear that, my identity as a ninja is at stake here~!
My fans seem to be concerned for me, too — they don’t quite understand what has happened to me all of a sudden, fearing that I’ve abandoned being the “ninja guy”!

They would simply assume that your unusual actions are the result of your order, would they not?
It appears to be a common understanding that the majority of idols’ strange behavior during the qualifying rounds is due to their order.

Yeah, but it’s hard to tell what someone’s order is if they’re already the type to act weird…
Like, for example, Morisawa-senpai’s been acting suspiciously ever since we arrived to Okinawa—
But I can’t tell if it’s ‘cause of his order, or if he’s just being his usual self.

Hmm, is he acting in an unsettling manner by any chance…? Morisawa left to help Kiryu get settled in the ryokan, since he looked to be in a serious state of health—
But if he&#39;s attempting to do something terrible in accordance with his order, it might have been a mistake to entrust Kiryu to him.
I was naive to think that Morisawa would never do anything malicious…

Nah, I don’t think he’d do anything bad. Even if he’s been told to do so by his order, he’d ignore it and do the right thing instead. At least, I assume he would… I dunno.
That said, Morisawa-senpai has been doing stuff on his own from time to time ever since we arrived in Okinawa.
He keeps regularly getting up at one point to say, “I’m sorry, but I’ll be going away for a while. Nagumo will take care of things while I’m gone.”
I’ve got no clue where and what he goes off to do, though.

Oh? That does sound suspicious indeed. So that’s why Morisawa was the only one who showed up when we first arrived.

Ossu. He only does it at very specific intervals, though, so it&#39;s not like it&#39;s interfering with Ryuseitai’s schedule or anything.

Indeed, though it doesn’t change the fact that it raises suspicion. We can’t really ask him why he’s been doing this, though. He always looks so apologetic about it, like he’s making things awkward.
Regardless, we’re forbidden from speaking about the contents of our orders, so it’s pointless to try and force him to talk, anyway.

Hmm, that&#39;s another nuisance about these orders. As an outsider, it’s impossible to judge whether someone’s actions are because of their order or not.
In this case, we can more or less agree that Morisawa is likely acting this way because of his order, since this isn’t how he usually acts. There’s also no way he&#39;s trying to imitate Mikejima, who always chooses to act alone.

He gets lonely easily, after all… He’d much rather spend time being close with everyone as much as he can, so if he’s been working on his own, then, yeah… I guess that really is his order.

…Anyway, the point is, Taichou keeps periodically leaving now and then, so I&#39;m sort of acting as the leader during those times.
I find that pretty cruel to do to me, though…

Well, I understand you’re in a complicated position… but Kanzaki is also acting as the leader of Akatsuki for now, and will be the one to decide on what Akatsuki should do during the qualifying rounds.
If you don&#39;t mind, I&#39;d like you to give him some advice as someone with experience, Nagumo.

Huh? Kanzaki-senpai’s taking over as the leader of Akatsuki now? How’d that happen…?

I can’t say. Figure it out on your own.

Hmm… I wonder if it’s related to Hasumi-dono’s order.

Order this, order that… I’m getting so sick of it. We sound like slaves or robots, or something…

Truthfully, I don&#39;t actually dislike it that much. I feel like a ninja, whose destiny is to live by a code. It’s like a game with its own set of rules.

It is a lifestyle that I am quite familiar with, as well. It reminds me of the time I was strictly disciplined at home, and would receive instructions that nearly seemed unreasonable.
The way I held my chopsticks, where I placed my zabuton… There were strict rules for everything.
However, if I had not followed those rules, I would not have possessed the capability to live a normal life.

fufu, Human beings always have such a hard time because of all their Obligations.
…mm?

What is the matter, Shinkai-dono?

i sense a strange Presence somewhere—

Huh? Huh…!? Please don’t say something so anxiety-inducing out of nowhere, Shinkai-senpai…!

—Stand back, gentlemen.
I apologize for not noticing this much sooner, but… I am afraid to say that this restaurant has been surrounded.

Surrounded? What do you mean, Kanzaki?

Haha, I suppose this is Heaven’s way of telling me to exercise after having my fill of Okinawan cuisine!
Okinawa seems to be a much more ruthless battlefield than I had anticipated. However, for that reason, I do not think I will be bored in the slightest.

Chapter 8


    At around the same time, at the ryokan for ES idols…

Achoo! Aah-choo…!

Woah woah, you alright there, Morisawa? What&#39;s with you sneezin’ all cutely? You sound like you’re the one who needs nursin’ right now.

Ugh… Sorry, I can’t help it when the weather changes… How pathetic is it to get sick during such a crucial idol event like SS…

Is that a dig at me for being too weak to even sit up?

Oh, no no, I didn’t mean it that way at all…!
I’ve heard before that you can’t handle vehicles, but it really was no joke, was it? I&#39;m honestly a little shaken — I&#39;ve never seen you looking this weak before.
To me, you’ve always been such a reliable and strong guy.

Haha, didja forget The War days when I would always get beaten up to a pulp? What kinda rose-colored glasses were you wearin’?
You, Hasumi, Kanzaki, Tetsu… You guys’re all always saying that about me — Calling me strong over just about anythin’.

That’s because you really are strong. Even during the days of The War, you always stood tall and proud, no matter what.

That&#39;s you, man. You never once showed weakness to others back then. Actually, you’re still like that even now, ain&#39;tcha?
I get how Itsuki feels nowadays. Showing weakness gives people the chance to take the advantage over you to crush you… Just the thought of that scares us, so we choose to put up a strong front and stand our ground.
But if I’m bein’ real with ya… It&#39;s tough having to lie even to your own buddies, don’tcha think?

………

Woops, sorry for whinin’ outta nowhere. It’s hard to stop your mind from wandering when you’re not feelin’ well.
I&#39;m sure I&#39;ll get better after a good night&#39;s sleep, so you don’t have to stay and take care of me. You should go back to your pals.
I heard a bit while we got here, but isn’t the situation in Okinawa lookin’ pretty serious?
You’re gonna regret it for the rest of your life if someone you care about gets hurt while you&#39;re separated from ‘em.
Take it from me, dude… I still feel an ache inside me whenever I watch TV shows that talk about moms. That&#39;s why I get so angry whenever I see Mikejima, honestly.
He always makes me think, “Quit dancin’ on people’s trauma with that damn smile on your face!”

I wonder why Mikejima-san is so obsessed with the concept of being a “mama”… Does he love his mother a lot…?

Who knows… He could also hate his mom so much that he chose to chase after an ideal version of one.
Ideals are called ideals ‘cause they’re outta our reach, and he’s walking on the path of hell by tryin’ so hard to get close. I could say the same thing about you, too.
“The heroes of justice”, was it? Honestly, I don&#39;t really like ‘em much, ‘cause delinquents like me are usually the ones who get blasted off in tokusatsu shows.
They beat us down, deny us, and force us to reflect and reform. It’s pretty shitty of ‘em to do.

Heheh… You tend to complain when you’re feeling weak, huh?

Only ‘cause it’s you, I’d never let folks like Hasumi or Tetsu see me like this. I showed you an ugly side of me during The War, after all.
Actually, that was the start of our relationship, wasn’t it—“Glasses boy”.[4]
I know I already apologized a buncha times, but I gotta say it again — I&#39;m sorry about what I did back then. My dumbass self got mad at you ‘cause of blind-sighted suspicion, and I said a lotta terrible things to you…

I&#39;ve also said this many times, but you don’t have to apologize. I was only dreaming at the time, and you gave me a good shaking and dragged me back down to reality.
Thank you, “Kiryu-kun”.

Quit it, man. I’m already feeling so weak right now, you’re just gonna make me cry.
…Hm?

Is something the matter?

Ah, I felt my phone vibratin’ — I think it’s a message from Hasumi. Is he double checking if we managed to reach the ryokan, or somethin’?

Huh, but I messaged Hasumi myself as soon as we arrived here…
Oh! Now I got a message from Nagumo!
Hmm…? He says, “Yo, we’ve got an emergency, Taichou!”

Oh yeah, Tetsu talks like that even on HoldHands, huh?
On the other hand, you’ve got Kanzaki who’s so polite and respectful with all his pretty words, you&#39;d think he’s the daughter of a wealthy family, or somethin’.

Yeah, all of our kids value their individuality. That&#39;s the kind of unit that we are.
But to get back on topic — It sounds like we&#39;ve got a real crisis on our hands, Kiryu.
It seems that our unit members were asked by the local Okinawan idols to come to the rescue. They&#39;re asking us to protect them from the ES idols’ tyranny.

Hah? The hell’s goin’ on…?

Chapter 9


    That evening, in Ryuseitai’s room inside the ryokan exclusively for ES idols…

Right, I’d like to go over everything again and discuss, as a team, our course of action from here on.

Is that really necessary?

Hmph… We don’t have a say in anything, and you won’t listen to us even if we did… You may as well just do it the way you like…

Yeah, we’ll do as told, so you can order us around.
We won’t complain no matter what you throw at us. That’s probably the best way to go about it, anyway.

Yeah, yeah… That’s how it always ends up for us, so you don’t have to pretend to be a kind senior who actually takes his juniors’ opinions into account…

I-I don’t approve of that attitude you two are taking! You cold-hearted modern kids! Let&#39;s be cooperative! Cooperation is important!

then how about we have a Pillow fight to improve our Cooperation skills~♪

Woohoo! That’s a must-do on a trip!
Though we always have one every time we work overnight for a job, I’ve lost on each occasion, so I have been brushing up my skills for this day!

fufufu, you’re such a Hard worker, shinobu~♪

Hard work may be Tetora-kun’s thing, but nobody ever said I can’t do the same! Heh~♪

How odd… Were we always this disconnected from each other…? Who made Ryuseitai like this…?
It hasn&#39;t been that long since our Comet Show performance, so I understand that it’s difficult to switch gears right away—
And while I understand this is all the result of my decision, based on what the world desired and what the agency ordered of us — I also do know we can’t go back to the bright and joyful days of our past anytime soon.
But… All our other paths have been destroyed, and we now have no choice but to aim for the ideal image that everyone wants and desires.
I know you may have your own opinions, but I hope you will accept this fact: Ryuseitai has been reborn as a five-member group with me at the center, as Red.

It’s more like we’ve gone back to the start… or maybe even regressed…

Mm~… I don&#39;t wanna be like this every time we see each other, so I&#39;ll just swallow my bitter feelings and accept the situation as it is for now.
I feel like I&#39;m starting over from the bottom, but that&#39;s how it always is for me, anyway.
I’m gonna work hard from the ground up again and become a big man that everyone in the world and the agency&#39;ll recognize. Ossu.

You’ve already grown to be such a wonderfully big man, Nagumo. The same goes to Sengoku and Takamine, too.

Are you talking about my appearance…? You know I hate it when my height is mentioned, right…?

Why do you snap at everything I say to you, Takamine…?

Shinkai-dono, Shinkai-dono! Did you hear that!? I grew bigger~♪

yes! you have been Growing slowly, but surely~♪

You two are having such a peaceful time… Must be nice…

fufu, on the other hand, it feels lonely being kept out of the Loop. if we are going through hard times, i would rather we do it together.
we are heroes, too, but it feels like we are always being protected by you—

………

well, we will leave it at that. let’s instead focus on what we need to talk about before chiaki Disappears again.

I really wish you would stop disappearing on a regular basis; it&#39;s causing us trouble and making us worried. But I’m guessing it’s your order, right?
Something like, “You are not allowed to be with the members of Ryuseitai for more than a certain amount of time.”

Even if that’s the order, I can’t confirm it. We’re forbidden to, after all.

Ossu, that’s true. And I guess I can&#39;t go around bending and breaking rules like Crazy:B, since I’m a hero of justice and all.
Then again, I never get rewarded for being a good kid anyway, so I don’t really see the point…

(Ahh… Tetora-kun’s been getting gloomier and gloomer ever since Comet Show ended…)
(It hurts to see, but the way we are right now is partly ‘cause I wanted it to happen and pushed for it—)
(I can’t act like we’re buddies who know how each other feels after all that…)

………
…i am going to turn on the Heater for a while. okinawa is usually warm, but it still gets chilly in the Evening.

That would be nice, thank you. You&#39;ve become very considerate, Kanata.

that is because someone else here is being pretty Thick-headed.

………

but… it feels Wrong to criticize only chiaki. it was just a matter of bad timing… i am sure everything was.

C-Counting the bad things one by one will only make you feel worse. When you’re feeling down, you should look for the good!
That’s what I always do!

You really are the opposite of me, Shinobu-kun… I feel like it comes as a surprise that you’re so positive…

Yeah, he may even be the biggest optimist out of the five of us.

Actually, I believe people have recently been using “extrovert” and “introvert” as labels instead of “optimist” and “pessimist”.

Is it really only recently…? And it doesn’t feel like anything’s even changed, anyway. It still sounds like they’re poking fun at the gloomier one…
Like, quit labeling me as something and acting like you know me…
The word choice may have changed, but the usual prejudice and discrimination is still there…

Now, now! We don’t want another venting session!

Heheh, but to be fair, the current situation feels like it’s been giving us a handful of headaches.
I only got the report after the fact, so I don&#39;t know what sort of conversation actually took place, but as I understand it, the Okinawan idols asked for our help, right?

Ossu, exactly. They asked us ‘cuz they noticed that unlike the other ES idols, we’re the only ones who’re trying to stop the war enveloping Okinawa, as if we’re oblivious to the situation—
And we’ve been going around telling everyone to stop fighting and get along with each other.

Yeah… The local idols have been picking fights with us, but we haven’t done more than defend ourselves…
We avoid hitting them back excessively, and call it off by showing our respect to them…
But thanks to that, we’re barely making a dime in SSL$ compared to the other ES idols, who’ve been preying on every local idol they find…

Chapter 10
Well, either way, it seems that the local idols have a good impression of Ryuseitai due to our pacifist stance, though you could argue what we actually have is a “soft” attitude.
Since we keep refusing to fight, we’ve given them the impression that they could talk it out with at least us, if not anyone else.

Ossu, exactly. So they approached us while we were chatting in the restaurant, to ask us for a favor.
They practically begged us to ask the other ES idols to not destroy Okinawa any further.

Indeed, they’re hoping we could act as peace ambassadors of some sort.
The local idols have no contact with ES, so they tried to negotiate through us, since we’re less intimidating to talk to.

It’s more like a plea than a negotiation. They were clinging to us in tears, begging us not to cause any more harm to them. Though honestly, there isn’t really any point in asking us that…

Yeah… I mean, running around yelling at everyone to stop fighting didn’t change anything about the situation…

I don’t think that’s entirely true. Thanks to our efforts, we’ve been able to get in touch with some of the local idols.
What we should now discuss is how to make the most of that development.
Personally, I would like to stand by the local idols. If we ignore those who came to us for help, we’ll cease to be heroes.

That may be how you feel… but…

But realistically, that’d be a bad idea. If we start working to protect the local idols, we’ll become literal “airheads” through and through.

Well, it depends on how much you believe in their side of the story.
Because if we assume that everything they say is true, that would mean that the situation in Okinawa is more unsettling than we thought.
But according to the notice from ES, the local idols in Okinawa are all extremely strong.
Thus, ES had sent some of the most distinguished power idols in order to compete with them.

That’s true. We don&#39;t know any of them except for Akatsuki, but—
The top picks from the renowned CosPro, and the veterans from RythLink, were sent over to this area.

Ah, yeah, I dunno that much about idols, but even I recognized some of their names.

Actually, how come you still don’t know much about idols, Midori-kun?

‘Cause I don’t have any interest in them… We&#39;re not competing on how many idols we know, are we?

Sure, but we often meet other idols on the job site, so there’s no harm in knowing more about ‘em.

Indeed. Also, I think that people will have a good impression of someone who knows them and shows interest in learning about them.

That’s a lie… It freaks me out when strangers know stuff about me…
It&#39;s so stressful to be approached by strangers whenever you&#39;re shopping in town, and then forced to give them fanservice…
It&#39;s tough to be expected to act like an idol twenty-four-seven, for the rest of your existence…

While l do understand how you feel, that is a tricky mindset to have as an idol.

Yeah, but I&#39;m doing my best… ‘Cause if I&#39;m even a little curt with my fans, they’ll write stuff on the internet like, “Takamine acted shitty to me.”

There’s no need to look up that sort of thing on the internet…

Yeah, we’ve got HoldHands as our ES-only social media, so we can avoid reading all those mixed outside opinions.
You’ll be able to do your work just fine if you only scroll through that.

But I’m too curious not to… Especially since Ryuseitai has been in a bad shape since the summer…
I can&#39;t say a word unless I know how it’ll be received by the public…

hmm, this is a very interesting Topic, but let us return back to the main topic.
as part of our duty in ryuseitai, and as heroes, we would like to help the local idols.
but if we do that, people will think of us as Airheads who cannot read the situation.

Yeah, that’s where we’re at right now. It seems that ES wants to conquer Okinawa with the powerful idols that they’ve sent, but…
If we’re to believe what the local idols say, then contrary to what ES has informed us, idol culture isn’t actually that developed in Okinawa.
Nevertheless, a small number of local idols have been doing their very best to continue their activities here.

Only for the ES idols to charge into the area under the pretext of the SS, and overrun everything…
—Is what the local idols tearfully told us.
They expressed that they’re frustrated that the environment they had established, the fans they had built up, and everything else has been destroyed or taken away from them by the ES idols.
And in order to relieve their frustration and anger, they even tried to pick a fight with us, as we looked relatively weak among the ES idols stationed in Okinawa.

Yeah… I think we&#39;re in a decent place in StarPro, but I guess we look like a weak unit compared to the well-known veterans and stuff…

To be honest, we have not made any remarkable achievements since ES was established. Akatsuki is in the same position as us, too.
Compared to other shining idols, we’re hidden in the background. It isn&#39;t a surprise that our name has barely reached the farther prefectures in our country, like here.

Yeah, well, we’re usually underestimated ‘cause we look like a bunch of colorful funnymen in the first place…

We’re almost like some sort of comedy band, after all.

To be fair, that also works out for us. There aren’t any other idols that look like heroes, so we’re easy to remember.
Only “true idols” were successful enough to make their names known through orthodox means alone, and there’s only a handful of those out there.

Those “true idols” are the ones invading and preying on Okinawa. I don&#39;t know what ES hopes to achieve with this plan, but…
What should we, the “colorful comedy band”, do in such a situation?
Was it nothing but talk when we said we want to become heroes, and in the end, we only follow the wishes of the higher-ups?
Do we not help the weak? Do we only pander to the strong and gleefully trample on those who seek our help?
All the while making excuses that there’s nothing we can do about it?

………

I honestly refuse to do that.

That may be how you feel… but…

yes. that is always how chiaki Feels about things.

I’m aware that there isn’t any point fantasizing about dreams all the time, and I know I should be making realistic decisions as a member of society.
But there have been far too many times, even during the performance in Comet Show, that I bent what I shouldn’t have while making excuses like that.
If I repeat that mistake one more time, I may never be myself ever again.
That sort of wishy-washy stance is not the hero I’ve aspired to be since I was young.

Chapter 1

    Season: Winter



    Half a year later. Middle of March, in ES’s first year of establishment…

The worldbuilding of the new show, Supervillains, seems to have finally been set in stone!
The decision looks to be absolutely confirmed this time for sure.

Oh, it finally has? It has become such a sensitive case that I thought it was cursed. I never imagined it to be this messy when we first accepted the request to appear on the show.

Yeah. The show had changed directors, scriptwriters, and various other staff members multiple times, and each time it happened, the content was fundamentally changed, too.
The one thing that was admirable about it was its ambition to make a blockbuster that would go down in the history of the tokusatsu world, and that did make me have very high hopes for it…
But after actually delving into it, I realized it’s turned out to be a terrible project. I won’t be surprised if they bury it in the ground as a dark time for them, due to all the disputes that led to lawsuits, among other problems.
How did it come to this?

Haha… I knew from the very beginning that there would be some trouble with the rights to the show, to be honest.
Nonetheless, this blockbuster in which various famous heroes, whether local or overseas, gather to fight…
Am I right to assume that the title of said project has been confirmed to be “Supervillains”?

Yup! At first, even the title kept changing, from “Comet-something” to “Superhero-something” to some other variations.
But they finally removed the “tentative” disclaimer from the title in the documents.
So yes, I think it’s safe to say that the title is at least finalized now.

There is not much time left until its release in spring, yet the title is only just now confirmed? That is freaking nuts.

yes~ it is freaking nuts~♪

Kanata, no! You shouldn’t use slang words like that. Little kiddos will copy after you.

wha~? i was simply [copying] what shinobu said, though…? so it is fine when he says it?

Yeah, because he’s cute.

gwah~!? so i am not cute?

Don’t ask to be called cute with a stature as huge as yours.

uwaahh~! shinobuu… chiaki has been so cold lately…

There, there~ Don’t cry, Shinkai-dono. Don’t you worry, you’re adorable!

really? can i really believe that…?

Of course! Nothing has been going well lately, with only dissatisfactory results in the process, so even someone like Morisawa-dono must be getting frustrated by now.
I’m certain that deep down, he also thinks that you are the cutest in the whole universe!

……(looks at Chiaki with anticipation)

……(Pats Kanata’s head for now)
Right, so. We went extremely off-topic for a moment, but — Supervillains will feature all of Japan’s world-famous tokusatsu heroes.
That was part of the original plan, at least.
The characters that were going to appear were not only life-size transformable heroes, but also giant robots, monsters, and even comic book characters that were to have their first adaptation.

It’s like every fan’s dream: an all-star tokusatsu show.

That’s what it was first advertised as.
There have been collaboration projects in the past with certain sets of heroes, but it was just for a one-time-only celebratory movie.
The plan this time, however, was to have a year-long super-interesting epic drama with a star-studded lineup of famous heroes.
The show wasn’t only going to get a movie, but also have multiple other shows broadcasted and distributed on the Internet and TV.
The project’s concept was the same as those movies with all the heroes from American comic books, but instead they were trying to do a local version.

they were trying to catch a rare fish[1], weren’t they?

Yeah… It was careless of them to try to fish up such a rare catch, but…
The production team had an unusually high budget, and various companies, including ES, invested in the project — so I felt that they were genuinely serious about it.
Plus, it was a dream project for me, as well. A blockbuster in which superheroes all across history would be active in every direction — just imagining it was enough to make me drool.
But in the end, it’s going to be a much more scaled-down show, though not entirely far from the ideal that they had.

Indeed. The companies that own the rights to the heroes who were scheduled to appear have been in constant dispute with each other, after all — but eventually, the plan just disintegrated.

ahaha… it is as if the [dream] had to be [adjusted] in order to fit [reality], yes…?
no matter what, [reality] is never as [satisfactory] as a [dream].

Indeed… In that sense, the SSVRS was a groundbreaking invention. It allows us to experience dreams as dreams.
I’m sure everyone would rather have a happy and convenient dream than an uncontrollable reality.

But it’s the special effects of tokusatsu that turn a dream into a reality. Isn’t that right, Sengoku?

That is indeed true. I, too, had my dream become a reality for the first time thanks to that, but mostly because of Ryuseitai.
And that would be — by becoming a true ninja.

by turning your [dream] into a [reality], yes? that is something chiaki has been doing since long ago.
if there are no heroes in this world, then we will become the heroes.

Chapter 2
Yeah… While we do tend to get beat up in the face of reality… That’s the sort of ambition we, Ryuseitai, are working under.
That’s exactly why we’re the one group that can’t, at any cost, abandon Supervillains, as it also has been suffering countless injuries in the face of reality.
This is a matter of our identity.
Or no, rather, it’s mine. I can’t force you guys to go along with my selfish desires…

I always think this, but you truly do not have to be so reserved, Morisawa-dono.

exactly~ you heard him, chiaki. let’s [keep] the [water reservoirs] for me, only~♪
all for one, and one for all—

But… that very premise for Ryuseitai has long been on the verge of collapse. Nagumo and Takamine haven’t at all been participating in our unit activities recently, for one thing.

They’re both absent today, too… Even though we told them beforehand that we’d have a meeting.

mm~ i believe midori may simply be [skipping] out on the meeting, but i do not think there is [much] we can do about tetora, is there? after all, things are like that for him right now.

Ahh, indeed. It seems that Tetora-kun has found himself in an unforeseen position. I don’t know exactly how it happened, however.
But even if we are physically far apart, our hearts are always one and the same. I’m certain it is. I believe in that!
Although, it seems like Midori-kun mainly cannot stand to participate in any Ryuseitai activities, and thus has been running away from them…

Takamine probably doesn’t mean to run away, though.
When all five of us gather, the atmosphere becomes uncomfortable, and he likely doesn’t like that, so he’s been avoiding it altogether.

ah~ yes, midori has that side to him…

Were this the past, Morisawa-dono would drag Midori-kun over by the collar like he always would, but…

Yeah… I’m not sure I can emotionally handle that kind of thing right now.

Anyway, during the time Comet Show happened, we agreed to appear in the tokusatsu show that is now called “Supervillains”.
Therefore, it would be against my sense of duty to leave now. And personally, I want to give it my all and see through the end, as well.
It’s in a pretty dire state, but it’s still a dream show for me.
Though, due to the show’s content being changed multiple times, all the practice we’ve put in will probably be for naught…
Apparently, even the scripts that were prepared for the show have all been rejected and will be rewritten.

We had been rehearsing our scenes according to the script, though…

Yeah… That’s unfortunately going to have been a waste of our time, since it looks like they’re going to reassign the cast and all.
We’re contractually obligated to perform at some point, but I still don’t know what kind of roles we’ll be cast in yet.

I would like to be casted as a ninja.

i love [fish]~♪

Mhm, I’ve already made our wishes known to them. So… I’d like to think that it’s unlikely that we’ll be given an unreasonable role.

But the content is… Well, I’m a little anxious about it, to say the least.
There’s a chance our character titles in the show won’t be “heroes”.
It means that we might be cast in a role that wouldn’t reflect well on us, the idol-hero unit.

To be honest, I feel as though only you are particular about that, Morisawa-dono. Regardless… Erm, does that mean that we might end up playing villains depending on how the script turns out?

About that… All the heroes in Supervillains are actually supposed to be villains in the story.

…? …? they are heroes, but they are evil? what does that even mean…?

I haven’t properly examined all the documentation on its worldbuilding to fully understand it yet, either.
But I heard that justice and evil are reversed in the story’s world, due to some sort of final boss that appears in the story.
The world within Supervillains is ruled by evil. In there, justice becomes evil and evil becomes justice.
The heroes in the story are predestined to be hunted as evil in that world.

Ah, that actually sounds interesting! Wow, so it involves people who are meant to be righteous heroes, but are actually considered villains in that world…

Yep. For us viewers who are outside of that world, the tokusatsu heroes are obviously the ones who are on the side of justice.
But in the story, they are treated as evil.
Normally, when a hero appears, the general public applauds them, but in the world of Supervillains, they scream in fear.
The protagonist of the story will be the very first hero in a world where values have been overturned, when they realize that something is wrong about their world.
The protagonist then helps other heroes who are being hunted as evil in other areas, and then they fight together to defeat the root of the evil that’s causing the world to go mad.
That’s the basic plot of the story.

In a sense, it’s good versus evil, through and through. Showing good in a world where evil rules.

Yeah… But while the gist of the story has been decided, there seems to be yet another dispute over how it will be presented.
Depending on what scenario they choose, one of them will be that the heroes become tainted with evil to the core and cause havoc and mayhem.
Then, when the heroes become fully evil, the protagonist beats them to get rid of the brainwash, and brings them back to their senses.

they get fixed by being hit? they are like [electronics] from the olden days.

Hmm… In that case, the setting where the world values are inverted is no longer relevant, and it will simply be the trope of a righteous person having an “evil era”.

That would be visually easier to understand, after all. They’ve made an overly-optimistic calculation that figurines and toys for the “Villain Version” might also sell.
But… I don’t know how I feel about depicting the hero, who should be a perfectly righteous existence for children, as being tainted with evil.
Of course, evil Kamen Riders, evil Ultramen, and various others alike already do exist, I’m well aware that they’re popular.
But what the kids — No, what I want to see are cool, virtuous heroes.

Chapter 3
You’re having a weird tokusatsu talk again…
It’s embarrassing being seen with you whenever you do that, so could you stop…? I’ll be mistaken for a nerd…

Eep, Midori-kun!?

Takamine! You little rascal~ You’re late! ♪

fufu, you have not been [showing] up lately, so we have been [worried] about you, you know?

I’m sorry Shinkai-senpai, sorry Shinobu-kun… I couldn’t stand to read messages sent from anyone in Ryuseitai, so I couldn’t bring myself to check the chat until the very last minute…
I got the courage to check just a moment ago, and rushed here as soon as I found out it’s a meeting… Sigh, I broke a sweat for no reason…

I know I sound insistent by constantly saying this, but you need to be more diligent about checking business-related messages! Promise your Taichou[2] that you’ll do that!

Ha, ha… “Taichou,” is it…

Hm? Don’t mumble, tell me what you want to say clearly!
I’ll accept anything you tell me.

Hmph… Maybe you’d be fine with it, but as for the insect crashing into you—

M-Midori-kun? How about you take a seat next to me for now? ♪

i will go make us [tea]~♪

Um, I have a solo job coming up soon, so if you aren’t talking about anything important, then I’d be glad if you could send me the gist of it later…
I just showed up as part of my duty as a unit member… I kinda wanna avoid meeting up with everyone in Ryuseitai as much as possible, but I also don’t wanna be scolded, so…

midori, it sounds like your [schedule] has been tightly packed lately, hasn’t it?

Yeah… It’s good to keep yourself busy, but are you alright? You’ll hurt yourself if you keep on working nonstop, y’know? Are you sure you aren’t overdoing it?

No… I think I’m closer to breaking down emotionally rather than physically, so I’ve been keeping myself busy to get my mind off things…
I know it makes no sense… I don’t get myself, either… I mean, I’m the one who wanted it to be this way.
Everything’s turning out exactly as I wanted it, so I get that I shouldn’t be throwing a tantrum…
But to be completely honest with you all, it’s practically impossible for me to do Ryuseitai activities right now.

Don’t misunderstand, Takamine.
You did nothing wrong. So you don’t need to fret yourself over any of this.

There you go again; it’s ‘cause you never let us bear any of that burden that—

—Mm, mm!!

Ah, sorry, it got tense again… It’s really painful to see, right…
I’m not a kid, so I know that…
I know that nobody’s in the wrong, nobody’s at fault… I know that we just need to suck it up and accept the situation, and keep on going with our heads held high…
But I just can’t switch gears that easily…

N-No, not that! Look at this news article that was posted right now…!

Shinobu-kun, you’ve been looking at your phone instead of paying attention to our important conversation…?

N-No, no, of course I was listening! But you see, I asked Yuuki-dono to install a certain app for me, since he’s extremely knowledgeable of electronics—
So I now have a way to automatically compile all information about Ryuseitai on the internet, from all sorts of places.

You can check that kinda stuff just fine, huh… I could never… any post I read on social media ends up stuck in my head for days, whether it’s a compliment or slander…

Heh! It is a ninja’s duty to excel at intellectual gathering!

you just keep being more and more [reliable] lately, shinobu~ good boy, good boy~♪


Ehehe~
…Wait, this isn’t the time! You have to look at this!

What…? Is it more flaming ‘cause of the slander from Crazy:B…?
I know we managed to extinguish the fire by now, but once something’s been lit up, it’s easy for it to burst into flames again… They really did the worst damage to us in summer.
…Huh? What is this?

Gah—! Don’t lean over me, Midori-kun! You’re crushing me~!

Sorry, I’ll look at it on my phone… Ahh, wait, I muted words like “Ryuseitai” and “Takamine Midori”—…

T-Then let us read it together! Look, this is from a pretty huge news site, and I believe it should be relatively trustworthy—

I’ll look at it from my phone. Let’s see here…
What the…!? What is this…!?
“Is Nagumo Tetora leaving Ryuseitai at long last!?” Leaving? What’s this about? Did anyone hear about this?
“After Nagumo leaves, he plans to become the leader of the new group, RB (Ryuseitai Black?)”
——What!? Whaaat!? What on earth…!? I haven’t heard anything about this…!

Chapter 4


    The next day. Okinawa prefecture, in one of the downtown alleyways, far away from the headquarters building of the agency, “Crimson Production”…

—An intruder?[3]
Is it another one of those random local punks causing a ruckus around the area again? Like those Oni descendants[4] or something—
No? They’ve been relatively quiet since their boss left for the US? I hear there’s still some guys left over around here, though?
There have been rumors that they’re regaining power, while the local powerhouses have been flattened across the board in SS—
Hmmm… Well, even if they’re just a bunch of troublemakers, we should be on the lookout just in case.
Yeah. For the time being, I’ll leave it to the B squad of the battle branch to deal with the intruder.


I know. We’ll also settle our matters as fast as possible, and then return to the headquarters building. We’ll discuss countermeasures against the mysterious intruder after that.
——Right then, time for another fun day of work at the evil organization.



    Next morning. Near the whereabouts of Crimson Production’s headquarters…

Hello, Taichou-dono? This is Sengoku Shinobu speaking, over.
As per our plan, I have reached the area of the company that Tetora-kun was dispatched to, which is called, erm… Right, the Crimson Production headquarters.
T-The air it emits is so grandiose that it is a little scary… A modern-looking building stands alone in the middle of a primeval forest, as if it were nothing more than a picturesque view.
There are no signs of dwelling anywhere nearby; only a majestically vast wilderness that stretches on.
Around the building is some sort of training ground… This may sound like an exaggeration, but it sort of looks like a military facility.
Ah, yes, I am aware of that. I have not forgotten that there are US military bases in Okinawa, so I will be extra careful not to trend anywhere close to them and risk myself.
There is no need to worry. When we were in Okinawa for the SS qualifying rounds, I had already mastered the geography and other various details about the region.
Indeed, I will not take any chances. I shall simply observe the situation, as we will be conducting a thorough investigation tomorrow.

Yes… This would have been easier if we managed to make contact with Tetora-kun through HoldHands or something, but we have not gotten any response for some reason.
Ah, no, actually… I can see a glimpse of someone who looks like Tetora-kun through the window of the building, and he seems to be doing rather well.
For some reason, he is leaning back on his chair with his legs propped up on an expensive-looking desk—
Is that really Tetora-kun…? He seems unusually different somehow…
Mhm. Regardless, I can assure you that Tetora-kun is alive and well. Although, I don’t know why he’s refusing all contact with us.
It does not help that we have no knowledge of Tetora-kun’s current situation, either.
I tried to gather some information about Crimson Production from locals on the way, but it appears that there is not much information known to anybody here, either.
Apparently, it used to be a well-established entertainment agency in Okinawa, but there has been little to no activity in recent years.
Indeed, it is as you say — Despite this, they have built a new building, and the land around here is apparently all owned by Crimson Production.
Mhm, mhm… I truly do wonder where they acquired the money to buy such extravagant property, when they have not even produced anything worthwhile. It’s quite obviously fishy.
There is definitely something going on here, Taichou-dono.

Oh, yes, of course. I am but a humble ninja idol, not a detective or police officer. I assure you that I will not do anything that could stir up problems for myself.
For the time being, it’s more than enough if we can simply confirm Tetora-kun’s current status.
Hm? No, no, please leave this all to me!
As we know, Midori-kun is taking on more personal work than he should, but you and Shinkai-dono have a lot of work to do as well, correct?
There is no need for you to cancel your schedule and come all the way to Okinawa. Is that not the agreement we had in yesterday’s discussion?
Mhm, mhm. It seems that the upperclassmen at Yumenosaki Academy are in dispute these days, as it is graduation season.
However, I still have one more year to go as a highschooler, so my yearmates and I are practically left out of the loop regarding all of that.
I have got the time to spare for all of this. That’s why you need not worry, I’ll be alright.
Hmm? What about my work as a Student Council member? Ohhh~ Yes, well, we’re stuck in one place right now, so even then, I have a lot of availab—


Hmm?
Huh? Oh no, erm, it’s just that I thought I saw something move in the bushes…?
A-A wild animal, perhaps? Or is it a security guard…?
E-Either way, I have a bad feeling about this, so I must conceal myself at once! Yes, I’ll provide you a full report later — For now, I will excuse myself!

Chapter 5

    Location: Near the ES building, inside ESTele’s studio



    At the same time…

S-Sengoku!? Sengoku, can you hear meee!?
I lost signal… I-Is everything going to be alright…?

mm~ i feel as though we should have gone to [okinawa] too, after all.
the [atmosphere] felt far too alarming…

No, we’ve all made our decision yesterday. We said that we’d leave it all to him based on the fact that he’s been extremely reliable these days.
And that we’ll do our best with our regular duties in Ryuseitai, while Sengoku is investigating what’s happening over on the other side.
I’m concerned about Nagumo, but we can’t afford to take a loss in our work. That would only worry the fans and the involved staff even more.
Unlike the heroes on TV, we can’t live our lives fighting all the time… That’s always the harsh reality about life, huh…

yes… but still, we will do what we can.

Yup. Of course, we’ll ensure full backup for Sengoku while doing our job. I would like to think that even though we’re physically far apart, our hearts are always one and the same.

Takamine is still prioritizing his personal work as we speak, though…

But, well… I suppose he can’t boycott the work he had already agreed to do, so there isn’t much we can do about it.
Takamine used to have no motivation, but now he works hard on his jobs no matter the reason. Personally, I refuse to oppose that.
The one who kept telling him to do his best, and to keep going is me, after all.
I refuse to become a two-faced person who changes what they say depending on the time and place.

fufu~ that would not be cool to do after all, right?

Yeah… Anyway, we have a scene to shoot, but I’d like to support Sengoku by gathering information in between.
In the meantime, I’m trying to contact the ever-knowledgeable Tenshouin on HoldHands to see if he knows anything. I’ll try other people, as well.

me too, i will ask [rei] if he knows something, since he is always so well-informed on everything.

Yeah, please do. There are also various rumors and speculations circulating on the Internet, but they seem to have no basis, so I think we should take them with a grain of salt.

yes~… the [internet] is so scary. i have come to understand that during the [summer].

Yeah, but I don’t think we should stay away from it excessively like how Takamine is. It’s how you utilize the enormous power you’ve been bestowed that determines whether you’re a hero of justice or a villain.
I learned that from Kamen Rider.
Tokusatsu shows taught me everything important in life.

…is tetora really going to [leave] ryuseitai entirely…?

That’s what the rumors say, but I don’t think so.

what makes you [say] that?

The ES rules. If you wish to withdraw from your unit, you must have the approval of the leader first. Those are the rules.
And I, the current leader of Ryuseitai, have not received any request form of withdrawal from Nagumo, nor have I approved it.
Since staff readjustments will create an issue with salaries and other aspects, it requires a report to ES — in other words, to the agency — as well as following official procedures, and so on and so forth.
And when I talked to Tenshouin, the verified head-manager of the current StarPro office, he also said that Nagumo hasn’t submitted any documents related to the matter.
I’ll ask Tenshouin to investigate as much as he can within his authority, and if he comes up with nothing, then it proves that there really is nothing to those rumors.

uu~… all these things about [rules] and [procedures]… it is a difficult [topic], isn’t it?

Human society is a complex and tiresome place, Kanata. No matter where you go, you’ll find documents, documents, and more documents.
That being said, I think it’s much more peaceful and upscale than a society where everything is decided only by feelings and impulse.
There isn’t any way to confirm how someone else is feeling or thinking, but with documents, you can.

even though chiaki is exactly the [type] to act only through [impulse]…

I’m not young anymore… Achieving anything through impulse alone only works until elementary school.
My point is, the online news about Nagumo leaving Ryuseitai and creating a new group called “RB” is likely a downright lie without any basis whatsoever.

that is what is called [fake news], yes? we have been constantly suffering from such reports since [summer].

No, let’s instead look on the bright side here and think, “After facing such hardships during the summer, we can now use those experiences to benefit ourselves.” None of the things we went through, and none of our effort, will be in vain. They never are, nor will they ever be.
Anyway, the question here is, how did this news come about?
How will the public react to it? And how should we deal with it?

in a similar way to “we have [trouble], a [monster] has appeared,” yes?

Yeah. Everything in life would’ve been so much easier if we could’ve simply assumed that “it’s all Gorgom’s doing!”[5], but—
Just as there are no heroes in this reality, there are no purely evil monsters or villainous organizations, either.

Chapter 6


    Nearly an hour later. Okinawa, in the Crimson Production agency office…

—Now then.
You really put us in a tight spot, “Sengoku-kun”.
Trespassing on our private property, investigating the area… I can’t simply let that slide, you know? That’s why I had a subordinate restrain you.

………

I suppose it’d be silly to ask why you’re here, so let’s get straight to it — Is it because you were worried for me?
You guys are a meddling lot as always.

— Okay, seriously, who are you!?

Hm? What do you mean?

What is up with the way you talk!? It sounds so weird!
Where did the Tetora-kun who would always say “Uu~myu” and “Ossu!” and “‘Sup!” go!?

Um, I am Nagumo Tetora, though? Quit yapping, it’s embarrassing.

Our Tetora-kun would never say that! What is going on here!? Have you been brainwashed by aliens or some kind of villainous organization!?
Or has a ghost possessed you, by any chance?
Ah—! Is it like NEGI-dono—


Look, that’s besides the point right now.
I’ve got matters of my own to sort through, so I can’t stick around and chat with you.
I’ll give you an option, though. If you sign here on this document, indicating that you promise you’ll never spill anything you’ve seen or heard here, I’ll let you go unharmed. So, what’s it going to be?

Uuu~ I cannot promise that! I must report to Taichou-dono and Shinkai-dono about how absolutely strange you’ve been acting!

“Taichou-dono,” huh? Hmph.  …Fine, I’ll just have you confined here for longer, then. Relax, I’ll get you food and whatnot. Just stay put.
When it comes down to it, Ryuseitai was still my old home. I don’t really want to fight with you guys either, m’kay?


(Ughh… Seriously, what is going on here…? What is happening in Okinawa…!?)
(The deadly war that was the SS is already over, so peace should have returned here…)
(That is why, based on the policy of ES, it seems that starting from the coming year, some form of ES branch will be established in the regions where the SS qualifying rounds took place.)
(SS was the sole domain of ES, after all… ES beat all the local powerhouses in the qualifying rounds, proved its capabilities, and spread its influence across each region.)
(They are trying to maintain this momentum in order to conquer the whole country.)
(They will create branches in each region, which will then join forces with each other to spread their dominance throughout the nation.)
(However, I heard that the construction of the branch in Okinawa was not able to commence due to the strong opposition of the local people.)
(Even now in Okinawa, the local idols are doing quite well, it seems. But that is exactly why—)
—Tetora-kun.

Mm, what is it? Do you need the bathroom or something?

Ah, no, I’m alright. Tetora-kun, I have one question I would like you to answer, at the very least.


And what would that be? I guess I’ll answer it if I can.

Tetora-kun, are you still a member of Ryuseitai?

………

There has been strange news spreading that you will quit the unit and make your own group… is that simply unfounded gossip?
I have come here to ascertain the truth behind those rumors. We have been anxious to know, as we could not get in contact with you for some reason.

…You do know my situation, right?
When it was decided that we would return to the previous formation, with Morisawa-senpai in the center of Ryuseitai—
All the new members the three of us had inducted into this unit and fostered on our own… Every single one of them decided to leave Ryuseitai.
Some then made their own units, some are still in the process of finding their position, and some… simply got sick of it all, and quit being an idol altogether.

………

And most of the members who split from the unit — or in other words, those who were to inherit the blood of Ryuseitai — created a group known as “Anti-Stars”.
The ones that gathered to this unit were some of the wilder troublemakers of Ryuseitai-N, the group that I was a leader of.
I’m sure you can tell from the meaning behind the name, “to deny the stars” — Anti-Stars have a grudge against Ryuseitai.
They loathe us. It’s only natural, and we have no choice but to accept their hatred.
We did horrible, awful things to those kids.
We gave them so much hope, only to waste time within their precious youth that they have but one chance to experience… and then, we mercilessly threw them away, leaving them empty-handed.
We deserve to be punched in the face by their rage. Don’t you think so?

Chapter 7
I mean, I came all this way just to get beat up by them.
All the members of Anti-Stars left ES and found a new home here in Okinawa, the prefecture that stubbornly continues to resist ES.
Then they joined this entertainment agency, Crimson Production, which has become the largest force in the region. Just recently, actually. I think it was right after SS.
In here, you’ll find tons of determined local idols, who haven’t lost their spirit even after they were ripped to pieces by ES during SS.
I think that’s why the former Ryuseitai-N kids, who are also anti-ES, saw this agency as a place they can thrive.
ES has been steadily expanding its reach nationwide, but because of their overly-aggressive methods, there has been a rise in what you could call “anti-ES groups” in various parts of the country.

T-That is why… you could not overlook the fact that the former Ryuseitai-N members joined such a dangerous group?
Thus, you have come here to tell them to stop doing something so ridiculous, correct?

What, so that I can tell them off? So that I can say, “there’s no way you guys can win, anyway”?
Well, that is how I explained it to ES and Taichou. On paper, I am an emissary whose purpose is to coordinate ES and Crimson Production.
ES is trying to subdue anti-ES organizations such as Crimson Production by offering them technology and funds.
It’s easier to silence them with money and the like than to start an all-out war.


As the guy who once led Ryuseitai-N, I was the perfect choice for the job of placating Crimson Production, since it has many former members of that unit.
And some of the former Ryuseitai-N kids actually wanted me to come over, anyway.
They asked me to save them. Crimson Production is an anti-ES group, after all. The former ES members of Anti-Stars feel inferior by default.
With such a distressing situation they’ve found themselves in, they can’t seem to do their practice sessions or work properly, either. And so, they asked me for advice on what they should do.
Even though I no longer have any authority, nor am I even a leader anymore, they came to me.
I can’t just ignore their pleas, you know? I didn’t even once think, “You all betrayed ES, and now you’re asking this from me?”
If they’re in trouble — if they call for my help, I’ll drop everything and come rushing for their sake.
That’s the least I can do for them, if nothing else.  …Do you have any problems with that, Sengoku-kun?

For now, I would simply like you to cease speaking to me like we’re strangers, including that strange tone of yours… Anyway, erm, is that why you came to Okinawa, Tetora-kun?
You are here to save your former teammates… to protect your former subordinates once and for all, whom you once failed to protect and caused to suffer horribly.
(Hmm… Did he slowly get dyed by those ideas the more he came into contact with these kids, who have been entrenched in anti-ES ideology…?)
(Is that why his persona has changed so drastically?)
(Tetora-kun’s so pure and straight-forward, and he always absorbs everything he comes into contact with… That is how the black color comes to be, and it is most certainly his strong point, but…)
(I do not think he should absorb dangerous ideas as well and make them his own, to the point that he is entirely tainted by them.)
(Has he truly become a villain — an enemy of ES by being stained with anti-ES ideology?)
(No, that cannot be… He isn’t a character from a comic book or something…)
(Is it even possible for a person to change so easily, in the same vein as a hero of justice who has been brainwashed and turned evil…?)
(Something is not right here. There is something very off about all of this.)

—Oh, I have to go now. My pals are calling for me.

…? Could it be — Have Shinkai-dono and the other members arrived?


Ah, you misunderstand. The people I consider my comrades now are the guys from Crimson Production.
Oh yeah, I’ll answer your question from earlier now. You asked me if I’m still a member of Ryuseitai, right, Sengoku-kun?
On paper, that would of course be “yes”. I haven’t submitted a unit withdrawal form yet, nor my resignation from ES to the office.
I’m still Nagumo Tetora, Ryuseitai’s Ryusei Black.
But, hmm… If I were to put aside what the documents say for a moment, and only consider the emotional aspect of that statement — I don’t know how true that really is.
I don’t think I can say that I’m on your side now.

What on earth…? You really have been tainted by a dangerous ideology—


Haha. What dangerous ideology?
We have people here who just want to live a normal, peaceful life — and then we have ES, who’s trying to force the whole world to be dyed in their color.
So tell me, which side is the one with the dangerous ideologies? Who’s the real villain here, hmm?

………

Chapter 8
Content Warning: Casual suicide mentions.


    Location: Starmony Dorm, Takamine Midori’s dorm room



    Next day, early morning…

(Sigh… A new morning, huh…)
(I’m so depressed. I wanna die. I don’t wanna get up.)
(What’s the point, anyway… It’s only gonna get messier and more complicated as time goes on—)

emergency~! emergency~!

It’s a brand new day, Takamine! Goood mooorning~! ☆

Oh… So it was just a dream all along…

Oh no you don’t! You shouldn’t escape reality so quickly, Takamine!
Open your eyes! Look around you! The reality known as “us” has arrived! Fuhahahaha!! ☆

What do you want so early in the morning…?
Not only Morisawa-senpai, but even Shinkai-senpai… Unlike that guy over there, you aren’t the kind of insane person who would attack someone in their sleep, right?


yes! of course i am not! it is also completely [normal] to puka puka in the [fountain]! that is how an ordinary person [behaves]!

Oh, right, our unit’s just full of airheads…

Yup! Now that you’ve come to accept that, get up, Takamine! We’ve got trouble!

What do you want, seriously… I apologize for neglecting everyone yesterday by prioritizing my own personal work, okay?
I’m begging you, please don’t terrorize my peaceful daily life… Are you two a natural disaster or kaijuu or something?

Why, of course we aren’t kaijuu! We’re heroes of justice! We’re trying our hardest to be that!

However! You have to take a look at this! This is the latest news article published online—

Mm…?
Wha— What is this…?
“Following after Nagumo Tetora, Sengoku Shinobu also leaves Ryuseitai!?”
“The mystery deepens! Ryuseitai, the unit that was said to be the oldest powerhouse in Yumenosaki Academy, is unable to stop its impending disintegration” — Mmm~?
What? What&#39;s going on here? Why’s the situation getting even worse before our very eyes…?

Naturally, we’re puzzled too! Yesterday, we had Sengoku fly to Okinawa to investigate the situation—
But then he found himself in some kind of trouble, and we never heard from him again.
I can’t even reach a signal, no matter how many times I phone him.

It’s not ‘cause you were so annoying that he blocked you… right?

Nope! I think it’s only you who’d do something as cruel as that to me, Takamine!
I’ll have you know, it’s a burden on me to always have to relay my messages to other people like Kanata whenever I want to contact you!


It’s an honor to know that I was able to become special to you, Senpai.

Mhm! I’d love it if we could become special in a more positive way! You little rascal~! ♪

mm, so, we were [worried] about shinobu since [yesterday]. and once it became today — as you can see, this is what ended up happening.

And that’s why it’s now sounding like even Shinobu-kun is quitting Ryuseitai for whatever reason, huh…?
But I mean… This is just fake news, isn’t it?
A lot has happened, so I guess it kinda makes sense in Tetora-kun’s case, but… Shinobu-kun would never abandon Ryuseitai under any circumstances, so…

Actually, you could probably say that if even Shinobu-kun of all people gave up on Ryuseitai, then we really are done for.
It’ll mean we’ve become the absolute worst group in the world, that even Shinobu-kun, who finds good in everything, can’t find any good in us at all.

Yeah… It’s hard for me to believe, too. But you’ll find a picture of Nagumo and Sengoku shoulder-to-shoulder in this article, smiling and posing together.
They’re both wearing idol costumes from Crimson Production, the agency that Nagumo was transferred to.
If one were to say that this is proof that the two have left Ryuseitai and belong to a new group, it would be hard to deny that statement.
Or rather, that’s what the article is trying to make you think.
While the interview in the article could be easily faked, a photo like this can’t.
Well, to be more specific — with today’s technology, people can easily edit two different photos together, but I don’t understand why they would do such a thing.
Something is definitely going down in Okinawa.

well, we already knew since [yesterday] that something is going on there. but it sounds much more alarming than we first expected, yes?

Yeah. It seems that the upper management of the agency is just as perplexed about this matter, and I’ve had numerous inquiries coming in since this morning, asking us what’s going on with Ryuseitai.

we are the ones who want to ask that, you know~?

Yeah, seriously. Regardless, I’m sure even you understand that we can’t just stand around and do nothing, right, Takamine?

Well, yeah, obviously… But what’re you even planning to do? You can’t get contact with either of them, right?
You’re not gonna suggest going to Okinawa ourselves to find out, are you…?

Yep, that is exactly what we’ll do! Worry not, Takamine! I’ve already contacted our agency, and any staff involved with our jobs!
We can now leave our work aside, and focus on the main issue at hand!

It’s only when it’s least necessary that he’s super fast to work…

In fact, this is what I should’ve done yesterday! I regret not taking action earlier…! Due to my careless decisions, even Sengoku has fallen prey to them!

Erm, he’s not dead or anything though, right? Isn’t he smiling and making a peace sign in the photo…?
And anyway, I dunno what’s going on in Okinawa, but won’t the same happen to us if we head over there…?
Won’t we also look like we ended up quitting Ryuseitai…?

That’s definitely a possibility. But just in case, I asked Tenshouin to officially deny it all should such news spread.
StarPro should protect their own agency’s idols, at least from time to time.

fufu. mr. [emperor] is a [nuisance] when he turns against you, but he is very reliable when he is your [ally], isn’t he?

Yeah. Although, we shouldn’t assume that he’s completely on our side.
He’d probably cut us off just as easily if it’s in the best interest of the whole agency.
However, that’s exactly why, while we’re still one of the most valuable assets that he and the agency must keep protected—
While we’re still Ryuseitai, one of the biggest money-makers in StarPro—
We have to solve this unprecedented problem.

    Location: In the training room within ES



    Time passes since then…

Tetora-kun, Tetora-kun!
I have news to report to y—
—Wait, what the—!? Eek—!

Gwaaaaaahhh!?


    (Sound of a thud)

Waah!? A-A-A-Are you alright, Morisawa-dono!? Are you hurt anywhere!?

………

Uu~myu, the way you flew away was a lot more flashy than I expected, Morisawa-senpai… Sorry, sorry.

Gosh…! Are you fighting again? We would be in grave danger were this filmed and spread around, you know?
It is already bad enough that there are rumors that Ryuseitai no longer have a good relationship with one another, due to the incident from a few days ago.
They keep saying that the Ryuseitai that used to always get along with each other is only in the past now.

Can we really do anything about that, though…? There are some dedicated fans who keep up with any and all information on us, but…
There are some who’re just picking up whatever information they find, and now think that Tetora-kun and Shinobu-kun have left Ryuseitai to become part of RB—
Or that Ryuseitai disbanded and became a different unit for Crimson Production…
There are some people out there who only have access to that kinda information, and misinterpret it as a fact.

That truly is misinformation… I mean, we have returned back to being Ryuseitai of ES by now.
Alas, there are quite a number of people who have misunderstood that about us, as they did not follow up with all the information at hand.
And likely because of that, we have been receiving some petitions saying, “Please go back to the original Ryuseitai, when everyone would get along with each other!”
On the other hand, we also receive requests for RB from companies that appear to be anti-ES. In fact, that is the very request that I, for some odd reason, have received this time.

It’s ‘cuz ES’s really hated by people… That’s why RB keeps gettin’ requests like that, since it’s seen as a unit that’s anti-ES.
I’ve been getting a lotta requests lately ‘cuz of that. I’m happy that they want me, but I feel like I’m deceiving everyone, and it pains me inside…

At this point, RB may be making more money than Ryuseitai itself.

Surprisingly, people like bad guys, too… Or more like, they enjoy seeing stuff ‘bout heroes who struggle between justice and evil.
Like, RB’s real popular among chuunibyou kids, for one thing.[1]

Ah, the demographic that likes UNDEAD and Valkyrie, correct? There is a decadent, dark charm to them, and there are groups of people who seek those themes.
My beloved ninjas were originally supported by fans who like that sort of thing, and it is how ninjas survived to this very day. The inhabitants of the dark world… So cool…♪

Ossu. It seems like RB just so happened to match that sorta public demand, since it was workin’ in that direction.
Oh, and not to mention that Supervillains’s influence really did end up being crazy.
We appeared in a promotional event for Supervillains the other day, for the purpose of denouncing Crimson Production.
That’s also why we now perform under the name “RB” instead of “Ryuseitai” in Supervillains’ production, as well.
It’s still written as such in our contract, so whenever Supervillains sells well or becomes a topic, RB’s fame grows, too.

supervillains is extremely [popular], after all, even though only the first part has been [broadcasted] so far.

Of course it’d be very popular. It has a lineup of all-time favorite heroes that have a massive, passionate fan base. On top of that, it’s undeniably a masterpiece with a godly script and direction.

Oh, you were alive, huh?

As if I’d die. I did warm ups during our rehearsal, but it’s also because you’ve become completely steady with your moves, Nagumo.
You make your attacks appear to be dynamic, but still never actually hit the target — your sundome is perfect.

Ossu! I’m grateful to hear that. Honestly, I am a li’l confused by all’a this, but I’m super happy that RB is getting more and more recognition, and even sellin’ well.
It’s as if I’ve been recognized by the world, and that makes me happy.
Thanks to all’a this, I think I’m starting to like myself a li’l more. Just a li’l bit.

Really? I’m so glad to hear that.
You were able to find your very own happiness and purpose in life — something that wasn’t me forcing on you.

It’s only ‘cuz of everyone’s support that I was able to, y’know!

Still, I feel bad that I’m the only one who’s happy.
RB’s doin’ great and all, but we need to do something ‘bout Ryuseitai, don’t we?
I’ve been doing real well so far, but everyone else seems to be in a decline as per usual…

Hmm… Maybe we should learn from RB’s success.

What d’ya mean?

Up until now, Ryuseitai had been aiming for my ideal image — an accurate representation of a hero sentai that loves justice and achieves justice, but…
As for RB, which has Nagumo as the commander — it’s been attracting a lot of attention by showing a “dark charm” that we wouldn’t have gotten a chance to express if we stuck to the same conventions, right?
That’s exactly why, Kanata, Takamine, Sengoku — How about each of you try to develop a completely new charm to Ryuseitai?

You mean… by following Tetora-kun as an example?

Yep. For example, how about we make a unit like “RY” — as in, Ryuseitai Yellow — with Sengoku as the commander…
And then do activities that we don’t usually do?

oh, i see~ shinobu is cute, so maybe it would be a good idea to aim for a super adorable [unit]~♪

Like Ra*bits? Ah, but I am not seeking out cuteness, personally.
However, it is an interesting idea. The thought excites me!

Yeah. For a long while now, Ryuseitai seemed to be stuck at a dead-end, but Nagumo’s RB breathed life back into us.
I believe we have no choice but to follow suit now. Investing in growth stocks is the basis of management.

I feel like there was a ton of luck involved with RB’s success, though… Like a lucky punch, or somethin’.

But… This is a hundred times better than dwelling on the past, wondering what went wrong.
‘Course, I’m totally gonna do my best to get on that bandwagon and help everyone out. I wanna know everyone’s ideal image.
I wanna see the new Ryuseitai that everyone has in their minds.
All for one, and one for all.
That phrase has never changed for us — It’ll always be the perfect way to describe Ryuseitai’s principles.

Aaalrighty then, let’s discuss all about it! All of us, together! Talking all about our future!
Starting with the guy who’s trying to look like he has nothing to do with this — Takamine! You’re very much involved in this, too!
Let’s hear your thoughts on your ideal Ryuseitai — “Ryuseitai Green”! I want you to speak your mind without any hesitation!

Whaa…? Ughhh, this is turning out to be such a pain…

But eh… I guess it’s fine. I feel like we’re finally going back to how we used to be.
It really is just like us Ryuseitai to be messing around like this, right?
……♪

    Season: Summer (after Comet Show)



    ES’s first year of establishment. Right after Comet Show — during rehearsal for the upcoming spring show: Supervillains…

(Oh no…)
(I accidentally hit Morisawa-senpai…!)

………

W-What the…?! What are you doing, Tetora-kun!?

Wha? Huh? I heard a really loud sound just now, what happened…!?
Sorry! I can’t be bothered to practice, so I wasn’t looking! What’s going on…?

U-Umm…? We were rehearsing the battle scene, when suddenly Morisawa-dono got blown away, and…!?
I-I think… Tetora-kun’s punch accidentally hit Morisawa-dono for real…?

are you alright, chiaki!? are you still [there]!?

Ahh… Uunh… That really took me out…
Erm, sorry Kanata, but please don’t shake me… I feel like I’ll lose consciousness for real if you continue.
I swear I’m alright.

but—

Fuhaha! Nagumo, you little clutz…☆

………

You making a mistake in estimating distance is such a rare sight, since you’re so good at karate!
No, actually, I should’ve realized that it would hit me and dodged in time!
My reflexes didn’t react fast enough! I’m so sorry!

Why ar—

Nagumo, I don’t blame you for this, but you haven’t been getting much sleep lately, have you? I can see you’ve got dark eyebags.
Exactly befitting of Ryusei Bla— Ah, um, anyway, you should take good care of yourself!
Trying to go about one’s day without proper sleep can lead to unexpected accidents like this one, you know!
The same goes to the rest of you; you have to be careful! Is that clear, Kanata, Sengoku, Takamine!?
That’s all for now! We don’t seem to be on the same footing today, so let’s call it a day and continue our rehearsal on a later date!
Farewell then! I’m off! I’ll head to the doctor’s office to have myself examined, just in case the hit did something to my body!
But before I go, I just want to say: don’t fret over it, Nagumo. I’ll be fine. Accidents like this happen all the time.
Injuries can occur even in pro-wrestling, where a script is always prepared. It’s the same when rehearsing and acting for tokusatsu shows. After all, even if it’s a play, you’re still fighting with your actual body.
You did nothing wrong, Nagumo.
Rather, and I say this again, I’m sorry I couldn’t foresee the accident to avoid it in time.

Why—… are you apologizing…
That was obviously all my fault. I’m the only one who made a mistake here. Actually… not just this, but everythin’ else, too.
The reason Ryuseitai got into this unnatural state—
Is all ’cuz I was weak, isn’t it? It’s all on me.

No, that’s not true at all. As I said on stage at Comet Show, I take full responsibility.
I was naive in my foresight. Because of that, I failed to give everyone the future they wanted. I couldn’t even push the agency, the higher-ups’ demands, out of our way.
I’m the one at fault, and I’m also the one who’s weak.
So… Don’t make that sad face, Nagumo.
You can hate me for all of this, and you’re even free to curse me.
I forced a lot of things on you and then took them all away without any logical reasoning — Both the leader position, and the red color…
I’m horrible for doing that. I shouldn’t ever be forgiven.
I betrayed your trust, trampled on your dreams and efforts, and hurt you.

I’m not a single bit hurt from that, though. It’s true that I was disappointed that I had to step down as the leader, but…
That was all ‘cuz I wasn’t good enough. If this outcome’s what the higher-ups and society want, then there’s not much I can do ‘bout it.
That’s why I accept things as is. Even if I really was a li’l hurt by all’a this, the punch just now made up for it, so it’s fine.
With that, we’d have hurt each other the same amount, and we can call it even.

…Except, what I took from you doesn’t even compare with that one punch you threw on me.

What’s with you? I just said that I accept the situation as it is. Yet you keep persistin’ otherwise, over and over and over again—

Wh— Why’s it turning out this way…? Please don’t fight…

Y-Yes, exactly! Ryuseitai is already in the worst possible position as it is! If a crack opens up even between us—

yes… that would be the [end] of everything.
the ryuseitai that we love would come to an [end] here.

Chapter Index
Ch 1 - Ch 2 - Ch 3 - Ch 4 - Ch 5 - Ch 6 - Ch 7 - Ch 8 - Translation Notes





Chapter 1
Content Warning: The following chapters contain descriptions of violence, and mentions of bullying.



    Later in the day. In Okinawa, within the forested area, where Crimson Production resides…

—Hmm… I knew it, so it really was that all along.
It isn’t that Nagumo and Sengoku weren’t getting into contact with us. It wasn’t because of their own personal reasons.
It’s just that they couldn’t contact us, even if they wanted to…
It seems like there’s some kind of signal jam around the Crimson Production headquarters.
That’s why no phone calls make it through from inside or near the building.

My initial guess was that Nagumo and Sengoku had their phones confiscated and then destroyed, but… It seems like it’s a lot more dangerous than I had originally anticipated.
A signal-jamming generator, of all things… At this point, you may as well tell me we’re in a tokusatsu or sci-fi story. It’s even capable of finding great use as a military weapon.
Speaking of which, Sengoku mentioned that the headquarters building looks like a military facility…
That wasn’t even an exaggeration. His intuition was spot on.
And now that I know that Nagumo and Sengoku have fallen into the pockets of dangerous people, who’re handling such a weapon without a care in the world… This makes me all the more worried.
This is no longer a problem I can solve on my own…
I have to hurry back to Tenshouin and — no, actually, I need to report this to ES as a whole, and ask them to take care of it.
Oh! Before I do that, I should contact my comrades, since they’re working separately from me. I need to let them know what’s going on and have them retreat.
Hmm… Alright, moving this far away from the headquarters building seems to be enough to get a signal. There’s only one bar on my phone, but it’s better than nothing.
Hello, Kanata? Takamine’s with you, right?
Yeah, it looks worse than we expected. I’m planning to get out of here immediately, so you guys pack your bags and get to the airport as soon as possi—


—You talk to yourself a lot, “Taichou”.
The cameras aren’t even rolling, you know. Are you in the habit of being unnecessarily cautious because the “audience” won’t understand what you’re thinking unless you say it out loud?

…Nagumo.

Heya, Taichou.
I knew you’d come. I was right to lay down a trap.
It’s only natural you’d show up. There’s no way you’d be so heartless as to leave all the work to me and Sengoku-kun.
If we don’t report, contact, or consult you, you’ll grow anxious and come to check on us yourself, right?
You’ve always been exactly like an overprotective parent.

Nagumo… I’m so glad to see you’re doing alright.

Hah?

At the very least, I’m glad to confirm that you’re safe. How’s Sengoku? He’s not hurt, is he?

Do you even know what’s going on here?
You’re trespassing on private property. I have the authority to detain and interrogate you.
I’m now in a position similar to an executive staff member of Crimson Production for a number of reasons. I may be a part-time employee, but I’m registered as an official staff member.
And neither ES nor Ryuseitai prohibits us from having side jobs, right?

Yeah, of course not. I see, so you got yourself a job. Mhm, that’s something to be happy about.

I’m more like a part-timer. But well, there are many people in the world who want to work, but can’t get a job, so…
I’m grateful enough to have someone hire and pay me, no matter how exploitative the corporation is.
…Ah, but I shouldn’t say anything bad about the company. It’ll affect my assessment. You never know who’s listening.


Anyway, I don’t have time to waste on idle chit-chat, so… I’m sorry to say this, but I’m going to have to restrain you.
That’s my job now as an employee in Crimson Production.
Don’t try to resist or escape at all costs.
If you do, I’ll have to hurt you.
I technically do owe you a debt of gratitude for picking me up and raising me. I respect you, and have compassion for you, as we’ve been close comrades for a long time.
That’s why, I’d rather avoid resorting to hurting you.

Chapter 2
………

I doubt you noticed, but — as of this moment, Crimson Production’s combatants are lurking in the bushes around here.

Haha. Combatants, huh? Are we in a tokusatsu?[1]

You’re the one saying that? That’s just what I call them, really. They’re basically fighters who’re willing to do the dirty work of spilling blood.
In tokusatsu shows, combatants are small fry that can be KO’d with a single punch — but I assume you at least know that in a real life situation, you should never go against them, right?
They have no resistance to violence. If anything, they train day and night just to hone their physical strength.
I’m sure you’re aware that an ordinary person like you, without any superpowers, can’t win against them in a fight.

Well, I’m not much of a fighter to begin with, so I wouldn’t really be able to win in a fistfight if I were up against an adult.
I did have the basics of self-defense drilled into me by Kiryu in our Circle, though.
He does teach me a bit of martial arts that are more for playing pretend, but…
When it comes to actual real life situations, all he ever tells me is, “If you ever encounter an assaulter, you should yell for help or run away immediately.”

Did he ever also tell you, “If they’re armed, you should surrender without any question and hand over whatever they want without provoking them.” — hm?
Because that’s exactly the position you’re in right now, Taichou.
You aren’t strong enough to oppose our attacks. You have no choice but to stay put and obey our command.
The situation is overwhelmingly in our favor. I’d rather not waste energy grappling with you, so I’d much appreciate it if you’d do as I say and let us take you in quietly.

…And if I don’t comply?


…? Were you always this stupid…?
If you don’t, this is what’s gonna happen.


    (Sound of a punch)

—…!


… … ………

Haha. Taken aback, are you, Taichou? I’m sure you’ve experienced a lot of flashy battles in tokusatsu, but is this seriously the very first time you’ve actually been punched or something?
Or, what? Did you really think I wouldn’t actually hit you?

Either way, you’re always so naive!
You need to wake up already! You should at least know the difference between reality and fantasy!
We aren’t in a tokusatsu show here!
I’m so sick and tired of being subjected to your hobbies!

Nagumo… Guh— (cough, cough)…

Ahh, sorry. I punched you in the chest — are you in pain from a bruised lung?
If you stop being able to breathe properly, you won’t be able to get oxygen to your body, making it harder to move. You won’t even be able to call for help because you’re in too much pain to scream. Efficient, isn’t it?
If you still choose to resist, then I’ll have no choice but to strangle you until you lose consciousness.

…I only have one thing to say, Nagumo.

Whoa, you can still talk, huh? You’ve got guts, I’ll give you that. I didn’t hold back at all with that punch.
So? What is it? Is it time to hear the sore loser say his last words?
Or are you going to lecture me now? “Stop with all these cruel acts! You’re supposed to be a good boy!”


Hahaha. That would be so funny.

No, even I’m aware that it’s pointless to give you a wholehearted lecture.
Now that you’ve been tainted with evil.

………

But, yes, I’d like to be a “sore loser,” as you put it.

Fine by me. I can’t wait to see the sort of cursing a good little boy like you can come up with.

I’m sorry, Nagumo.

…? Why are you apologizing?
Haha. We&#39;ve had this same exchange before, haven’t we?
But unlike how it was then, this time around was no accident. I hit you with full ill-intent.
Though, I was still a hero back then, and right now, I’m a villain to the very core.

Yeah, you surprisingly suit that role as well, Nagumo.
I may have been destroying your potential for the sake of my dreams all this time.

That’s what you want to apologize for? You didn’t drag me in by the collar, nor force me to do anything. I chose this path on my own, m’kay?

But you didn’t like being here originally, right? Back when you first joined Ryuseitai.

Yeah, but all those feelings disappeared half-way. I did everything because I enjoyed it.
I even thought that the heroes you admired matched the ideal that I should aspire to be.
The ideal man among men, that I’ve been striving to become since I was a little kid.

Ah, I see. How about now?
Is there still a hero at the end of the path you’re walking?

I don’t know. …I’m not sure anymore.

—Excuse me for changing the subject, but… I used to get bullied often in the past.

……?

I’ve never told you guys much about it because I was so ashamed, but—
Ryuseitai used to be a horrible unit back then.[2]

Even compared to the present Ryuseitai, at its current abysmal state?

Yeah, even compared to that. No one took their activities or lessons seriously, and yet they would always put on airs by misusing the reputation of being in “Yumenosaki’s oldest idol unit”.
They gained profits and fame just by leeching off of that reputation. That was how the Ryuseitai members of the past would continuously play around and squander what they had gained.
They indulged in their pleasures without ever bothering to do anything troublesome or difficult.
It’s ridiculous to study, take lessons, and work wholeheartedly. It’s foolish and wrong to spend your precious youth, that you can only experience once, on tiring tasks.
It’s right to laugh and behave foolishly, throw away irritating obligations, skip classes, and play around all day.
That was the form of justice that Ryuseitai believed in, once upon a time.

………

I was the villain who defied the justice of that Ryuseitai.
I just couldn’t read the room… I kept calling over everyone who was unwilling to do their best and kept trying to tell them to straighten up… so they saw me as an absolute pain.
That’s how I became the target of bullying. Whenever I came face to face with everyone in Ryuseitai, who were supposed to be my comrades, they would only poke fun and laugh at me.
I became someone against justice, who deserved to be kicked and cursed at — in other words, an evil monster.

That was why I was forced to do all their tedious jobs and homework, day in and day out.
Among many things they forced me to do, one of them was cleaning the pool in the middle of the night, all on my own.
It was agonizing… It was hell itself.
Of course, there are a lot of people in the world who are much worse off than I was.
There were even people like that in the very same school. I may have been bullied, but it was nothing compared to what the Five Eccentrics were subjected to.
That’s why I couldn’t complain to anyone. I just couldn&#39;t let myself whine — about how hard it was, about how much I couldn’t stand it anymore — as if I was some sort of wuss.

………

Chapter 3
That’s why I tried to get through the days by always pretending to be an idiot who didn’t think or feel anything. I just smiled and laughed, convincing myself that I was happy.

And then, on that starry night — I met Kanata, who had lived a much more pitiful life than I, and had never been treated as a human being—
That mask of mine, of a crudely drawn smile, was completely smashed to pieces by Kiryu and Akehoshi—
And like a miracle, I “transformed” into the hero I had always yearned to be, even if only for a mere moment.
And with the help of the kind-hearted villains, Akatsuki, who went along with my farce… I was able to build up the Ryuseitai of today.
The Ryuseitai that I dreamed of.

…What the hell have you been on about?
Do you think I’m going to take pity and go easy on you just because you revealed your shameful past?

Yeah, I wonder why I’m saying all of this… Mhm, you’re right, this has nothing to do with anything.
But it’s something I should have told you before, and it felt like the opportunity to mention it presented itself.
In fact, I apologize for taking so long to tell you. I’m sorry.

Mm… It’s very different from what I’ve heard from Shinkai-senpai. From his point of view, Taichou was a super cool hero from the beginning to the end.
I had no idea about how you were “before transformation”.

The reason he never told you about it is likely all my fault.
Ryuseitai is indeed the oldest idol unit in Yumenosaki Academy. It’s a veteran powerhouse with history and tradition.
But the ideal Ryuseitai that everyone loves and the agency wants is something that I forcibly created in my generation.
A dream that a bullied, cowardly tokusatsu nerd dreamed of, that just so happened to become a reality.
But a dream is nothing but a dream. You have to wake up someday.
No, in fact… I should have properly ended my dream when I had passed the leadership position to you.
I should have given my story a proper ending and handed over my place to the next lead star, the hero of the new era.
Just like the tokusatsu heroes I love so much.
That’s why, I’m so sorry, Nagumo. This whole year’s messy development is all my fault — It’s all because I never properly settled these things.


Why the hell do you keep apologizing!? It pisses me off!
“What went wrong?” “Why have we turned out this way?”
We’ve gone through this so many times by now, over and over and over again.
Yet… we never managed to come to a conclusion. There’s no point in dredging up the past. Maybe we could at least brace ourselves to avoid repeating the same mistakes, but…
It’s unproductive, and in reality, just pointless. No amount of regret will change our situation.
That’s why I—
……!?

What’s wrong, Nagumo? Is there trouble?

A messenger is here… He says there are trespassers breaking into the headquarters building of Crimson Production as we speak.
Hold on… No, don’t tell me the reason you’ve been blabbering on endlessly was to—

Mhm, I wanted to apologize for that too. Sorry, sorry.
I’ve said this many times already, but I used to be a victim of bullying. That’s why I’m pretty sensitive when it comes to malicious intent.
We live in a world in which the weak are meat; the strong do eat. Weak meat like me had to be extremely vigilant to avoid being eaten. I wouldn’t have survived otherwise.
That’s why I was already aware that you were approaching and surrounding me, even before you spoke to me.
I intentionally spoke aloud for that reason, and lied to you as if Kanata and Takamine were on standby somewhere else.
I was intentionally misinforming you guys.

Ugh, I was wondering why you were all alone when you’re such a pushover—
—This guy’s a decoy! There are other guys from Ryuseitai breaking in! Don’t let them get away! Capture them all!

Fuhaha! It’s too late to panic now.
There’s no signal in this area. None of you can use your phones either, so the only way to communicate is to send a messenger.
Your colleagues over in the headquarters building won’t be able to respond fast enough to the crisis.
And I’m sure that, now that Kanata and Takamine broke into the building, they’ve already made contact with Sengoku and rescued him from his confinement.
I don’t know what sort of situation Sengoku is in right now, but he is the only one who would never betray Ryuseitai. Even now, he’s bound to be on our side.
They’ll have joined forces with Sengoku, and since he’s good at gathering information, they’ll continue to investigate the building.
Since it’s your headquarters, that means that there’s a possibility of finding information that could destroy your footing, such as evidence of illegal acts.
If we can secure it and escape safely, it’ll be our victory.
Crimson Production would collapse and go bankrupt. And you, as an employee of this corporation, would be able to wash your hands from all the evil.

…And here I thought you were nothing but an idiot…
So what? Sure, we’ve taken your bait, and now security at the headquarters is a little thin. And sure, maybe you’ll be able to at least get in touch with Sengoku-kun, or search the building.
But that doesn&#39;t change your situation.
You’re surrounded by a group of people who aren’t afraid to use violence, and you’ve clearly provoked them — by declaring war.
Are you a dumbass, or what? Did you not consider we could just kill you for making us snap? Just how much of a pacifistic idiot are you?

Don’t look down on your older brother so much, Nagumo.
Our generation has survived the Yumenosaki War Era, days that you’ve never experienced. A war that was fought, full of deceit.
“Pacifistic idiot”? Just who do you think you’re speaking to, junior?

………

I wouldn’t ever barge into a dangerous place like this without any precautions or preparation in the first place.
Regardless, even if I do get killed or otherwise disappear, Tenshouin will make his move. I made sure those arrangements were set in place before we left.
Tenshouin is someone I can ask for that sort of favor, because he’s my friend.
And if the supreme Tenshouin Zaibatsu comes into play here, the fate of Crimson Production would soon be in dire state.
That’s when you’ll truly be doomed. They’ll absolutely investigate all of you thoroughly, count up all your sins, and crush you.

………

I’ll say it a hundred times more. This time, it’s my victory — our victory, Nagumo.
Your biggest mistake was to choose the path of evil. And typically, this isn’t something said to the loser, but—
I choose to deliberately tell you, my immature and foolish junior, my favorite phrase:
—Justice will always prevail.

Chapter 4


    Nearly an hour later. Inside Crimson Production’s agency office…

I’m so sorry, Morisawa-senpai.

our plan was a [complete failure].

We were all captured easily…

You guys…!

Ahahahahaha!!
Hey, Taichou, what were you just telling me oh-so-proudly earlier? “It’s our victory”? “Justice will always prevail”?
So I wouldn’t be wrong to assume that this means that Crimson Production is on the side of justice, would I?

Guhhh… This is so frustrating. There’s nothing I can even say to counter that…

Just seeing Morisawa-senpai this frustrated brings me joy somehow.

W-Why, Takamine!? Why are you happy!? I don’t recall ever raising you to be such a mean-spirited boy, who would laugh at other people’s demise!

I don’t recall being raised by you, either.
But I mean, who wouldn’t laugh at this situation?
—Hey, um, so… I don’t really get what’s going on here, but how much of this was an act, in the end…?

………

It is all right, Tetora-kun. I have been locked up here ever since I was captured—
But because you tied me up so loosely, I was able to discreetly free myself by utilizing Ninpou: Rope-removal Jutsu.
I took advantage of any opportunity that I wasn’t being watched to thoroughly observe the office. I investigated all the positions and angles of the surveillance cameras, as well as sound recording devices, until I had a perfect grasp of their effect range.
As long as we speak quietly in the corner of this room, there is no possibility that anyone else can hear what we are saying.
However, since the surveillance cameras will catch a glimpse of us, it would be better for you to continue looking like a scary villain, if possible.
You will need to maintain a villainous demeanor in your posture and manner of speaking, as well.
After all, while you may have been able to clear the area by telling everyone that you’ll be the one to interrogate us, we do not know when the Crimson Production staff will come back.

Okay. I’ve gotten used to speaking in this tone now, anyway. I used to talk like this when I was young, and it’s starting to come back to me.

Ahh, I didn’t know you used to talk normally when you were young. Makes sense, though.

Yeah, I was trained thoroughly to speak that way when I started learning karate, or well, it’s just that it became so natural to start saying “Ossu” and the like.
In Shinkai-senpai’s case, it feels as though he may have been this way for a long time — but “Shinobu-kun” didn’t always speak like a ninja either, did he?

Mhm… Ehehe, Tetora-kun with a normal tone of voice has a slightly different and dangerous charm to it. I think it’s lovely!

Ehh~… I dunno what it is, but I don’t really vibe with this Tetora-kun… He’s got that shallow energy of someone who I’d never be able to understand, and neither would he to me.

I mean, if we weren’t in the same unit, I doubt we’d have ever spoken to each other in the first place, you feel me?

Yeah, I know what you mean… Fate’s really a strange thing, isn’t it?

…um. i do not think i fully [understand].
so, in the end, what does this mean?

That’s a pretty vague question, huh? But I know what you’re trying to ask.
To put it very briefly: I’m basically an undercover agent sent by ES.

He’s a ninja, a ninja! ♪

Well, more specifically, I’m a spy. Now that ES is dead-set on a nationwide domination, there has naturally been an emergence of resistance groups throughout the country since SS — the “anti-ES organizations,” so to speak. ES finds them to be an eyesore.
They consider them a hindrance, like this agency we have here, Crimson Production.
That’s why they’re trying to destroy them. Preferably by exposing their corruption and criticizing their acts in front of the public, by fair means.
So when Anti-Stars, my juniors from the former Ryuseitai, asked for my help, I was selected as the person in charge.
And then I was dispatched to Okinawa, under the guise of consulting with Anti-Stars, since they had been incorporated into Crimson Production.
That was the sort of pretext I was working under.
In other words, that’s just the surface. Behind the scenes, though, I was actually asked by ES to spy on Crimson Production, an anti-ES organization.

Chapter 5
My initial assumption that Tetora-kun betrayed ES after being tainted by anti-ES organizations was entirely wrong.
The truth was actually the exact opposite; you were always on the side of justice. And as part of ES, you had sneaked into Crimson Production, which has been regarded as an evil organization… Correct?

Yep, yep. I had to make myself look and act like an ES-hating guy, even pierced my ear to give off more of a delinquent look. It was super painful.
Then I gained the trust of this agency and got hired by them, and the rest was history.
I managed to stay undetected because my fellow former members of Ryuseitai, the Anti-Stars, were already a living example that switching sides was possible. They’ve been steeped in anti-ES ideology, after all.
And in reality, I have a lot of mixed feelings towards ES. Some of it is resentment, to be honest.
I’ve been pushed around a lot by ES and the agency’s selfishness, for one thing.
That’s why acting like an ES hater came naturally to me.
In fact, I spilled so many of my hidden complaints that I almost tricked myself into thinking they were my true feelings all along.

I almost became infected with the same thoughts as the anti-ES groups. Honestly, cursing people, saying how much you hate them, criticizing them… It’s all pretty fun to do.
It’s a refreshing feeling.
I can sort of see why some people get addicted to it.

But if I ever end up getting obsessed with all that hatred, that’s when I’ll really start to despise myself.
There are a lot of things I don’t like about ES and our agency, but that doesn’t mean I think they’re all hateful, evil beings to be trampled on.
There have been just as many happy, grateful things that have happened to me at ES. And there are also a lot of people I love there.

Tetora-kun…

Nagumo…

Haha. Maybe I tried to sound a little too cool there.
But the reality of it all isn’t as cool as I make it sound… As I began my secret investigation, I grew to understand just how horrifying Crimson Production actually was.
I thought to myself, “This really is an evil that must be defeated, regardless of ES’s wishes.”
On top of that, the Anti-Stars — my former comrades from Ryuseitai-N who believed in me and followed after me — somehow found their way into Crimson Production.
If things continue as they are, those kids will be charged with crimes and be put on trial as members of a villainous organization.
I can’t allow that to happen at any cost. I refuse to overlook it.

Umm… Is Crimson Production seriously that bad of an agency…?

Well, I think it’s pretty clear considering they have fighters ready for anything that requires violence, but — The reason for that is, in reality, Crimson Production is basically like an organized crime enterprise.
Yakuza is what you’d call them, if this were a few years back. I think nowadays they’re called, uh, what was it… illegal groups…?[3]
Illegal acts and corruption are commonplace here. They’re a dangerous organization that commits actual crimes, not just some violations here and there.

Are you for real…? So people like that exist outside of the fictional world, huh…

Yeah… The world we perceive is miniscule — and outside of it, behind the scenes, lies an unbelievable reality. I became aware of that far too well during my time working here.
I realized that I was nothing more than a naive brat who didn’t have a clue about anything…
I wish I could go back to the old days, when the most frustration I ever felt was towards my elders and seniors…
I never wanted to get involved with actual criminals…

………

Anyway, moving on… Because they were such a dangerous group, Crimson Production had gone down the drain once before, thanks to the self-cleansing efforts of the Okinawan locals.
Apparently, there was a huge dispute with a local vigilante-like group called “Oni” or something like that, which led the enterprise to their defeat and dissolution.

ah— i have heard of mr. [oni]. apparently, they had an association with the [okinawan] people who still [worship] me.
but now, because their [boss] is no longer around, they appear to have [disbanded].

Yeah. It seems that the vigilante group was disbanded after overthrowing Crimson Production, who were their biggest enemy.
But evil in this world doesn’t perish for good… ​​After absorbing all the dissatisfaction with ES that’s festered since the events of SS, Crimson Production made its revival.
ES exploits the profits of its dominion, and many locals don’t like that. After all, the more that the idol industry becomes favored over other businesses, the more the owners of vested interests suffer damages.

And those who had a foothold on those interests would naturally start having complaints…

Yeah, and after gaining power by uniting with those sorts of people, Crimson Production began to go down the path of evil once more.
While ES is an evil that deserves to be criticized for its aggressive invasion-like behavior…
Crimson Production is also an evil that doesn’t hesitate to commit heinous crimes.
The events happening in Okinawa right now aren’t some exciting fictional tales, of a hero of justice defeating evil.
It’s a real battle between evil and evil, doing all they can to devour and crush each other.

Chapter 6


    Later that night. In the film studio within Crimson Production…

I’m sorry to say this but, I can’t allow any of you to go home safe and sound.

………

All of you are trespassers. In other words, criminals.
Tomorrow morning, we hand you over to official authorities, the police — or, you become our own little obedient servants, lackeys, or something else similar to that.


By the way, “Sengoku-kun” chose the latter — to become one of us in Crimson Production.
And if he becomes a member — in other words, an accomplice — he won’t be able to betray us.
He-he… He flew from ES’s arms into ours in a bat of an eye. I guess a ninja’s loyalty isn’t that big of a deal in the end, huh?

(whispering) Meanie~… You’re the one who told me to do so.
You said that, since people from Crimson Production are lurking among the local cops, it would be the end for me if I were handed over to the police.
I could even get a criminal record, depending on the charges… If that happens, it will hinder my idol activities in the future.
Oh, just to clarify, if I talk from this position and at this volume, no sound will be picked up.
However, the surveillance cameras will have a clear sight on us, so if a lip-reader were here, they would know what we’re talking about. Thus, let us keep the talking to a minimum either way.

This is all a big pain somehow, so I’m just gonna stay quiet throughout the whole thing.
There is some stuff I personally wanna say to Tetora-kun, though.

Oh? Well, I’ll hear you out later, then.
There are a couple of things I’d like to talk to you all about, as well.

Hey, guys! I’ve prepared everything for us to sleep! Thankfully, Nagumo brought us food and sleeping bags, so we should be able to spend the night fairly comfortably!

this is so much fun, it is like having a [camp]~♪

Yeah! And look, look! I think we’re in a studio for a local tokusatsu show! Their diorama is surprisingly excellently crafted!
I’ve always dreamed of sleeping in a place like this! I feel like a giant kaijuu! I&#39;m so happy!

fufufu~ there was a [movie] like that, right? the one where mr. [kaijuu] sleeps in the middle of the [street].

Our two seniors aren’t even trying to sound panicked… We just said not to talk so loudly.

Mhm, sorry about that. But I feel so relieved, like a weight’s fallen off my back.
I doubt I could act terrified of being trapped in an evil organization right now, even if I tried.

Well, that’s okay then, as long as you take caution. Earlier today, you reminded me once again that you’re surprisingly really good at acting, anyway.
Using yourself as bait to draw us away from the building, so that the other two can break in—
The plan failed in the end, but it did make me break out in a cold sweat for a moment.
To be honest, I underestimated you seniors a little too much. Your base stats are surprisingly high.

Yep, everything went just as planned! Mission complete~♪

…? Didn’t our plan fail…?

Ah, well— Ohh, I get it now, this really was a success — just as he planned. Morisawa-Taichou’s goal was likely to attract the fighters in charge of security over to his side.
And that’s exactly what happened — practically all of our combatants fell for the bait and charged over to him.
On the other hand, that meant that the strength of the forces within the building was greatly reduced. So the two breaking in were seized by ordinary employees who weren’t suited for combat.
Which effectively avoided any violent measures that could’ve been used on both of them.

yes~ he told us to do as they [say] if we get [caught].
that was also to [prevent] any unnecessary [violent acts] to befall us, yes?

Hmph… So all along, the plan was to get caught, so we could make contact with Tetora-kun?
If that’s the case, why didn’t you just say so from the very beginning?
All that time while we were breaking into the building, I was just terrified of the thought of getting killed if I slipped up for even a moment.

fufu, thanks to midori’s [realistic] response, we did not raise suspicions among the [staff members].

Well, that’s just an afterthought. To be honest, I didn’t think Takamine would participate in this mission at all.
I thought he’d be too terrified to do so, and would ask to stay back at a hotel.
Were that the case, I was planning to have him return to ES alone and be a messenger to report various matters to Tenshouin and other staff members.

Why would you think that? I couldn’t care less about Tetora-kun, but since Shinobu-kun of all people got captured, even I’d wanna go and save him…
That’s why I sucked it up and did my absolute best, even though I was literally scared out of my wits.

Heheh, the one with the biggest potential in Ryuseitai is and always has been “Takamine-kun,” huh?

That’s ‘cause I started from rock bottom! Hmph!

Haha, you’re sulking~. But honestly, I’m surprised. Morisawa-Taichou was much more thorough in his preparations than I expected, and it really helped me out.
He seemed to have noticed my message, too.

Chapter 7
…a message?

Yep. Among the many things I changed about myself, one of them is the way I speak — yet I kept calling Morisawa-Taichou by the title “Taichou”.[4]
If I really did hate ES enough to defect and become the leader of the “RB” group, then there’d be no reason for me to still call him by that title.

I didn’t get the sense that you were being sarcastic, either. Your tone indicated respect.
On top of that, I barely felt any chest pain when you punched me. It was like a fight scene from a tokusatsu — just a punch that looks like it hit, but doesn’t actually have any force to it.

That’s karate’s sundome for ya, ossu![5] Jokes aside, you also helped make it look real by putting on a convincing act that it hurt, Taichou.

Yeah, although we were enemies on the surface for that moment, we were secretly communicating with each other. We were able to figure out each other’s intentions and make the right moves.
The moment I touched your hand, I knew for sure that you didn’t betray us — that you didn’t become tainted with evil.
I was certain that you were still one of us.

That’s just plain incredible… I genuinely thought Tetora-kun did a complete 180…

Well, they do say that to fool the enemy, you have to first fool your allies.
If I don’t act convincingly enough to fool even people who know me well like Takamine-kun, I’d never be fit for undercover work.
But… even I think I sound a bit odd when I’m acting like a bad guy, so it’s no surprise that people who know me can tell right away that it’s an act…
I wasn’t even sure if I could fool Sengoku-kun at first when I captured him, and then before I knew it, he caught on pretty quickly.

Ahaha… To be fair, my friend Yuuta-kun also suddenly changed his character the other day, so I was a little perplexed at first, like, “Is this a trend lately or something?”[6]

Still, as soon as Sengoku-kun got over the shock, he started asking me, “Why are you acting like that? I would like to know what’s going on!”
He even whispered to me, “I may be able to assist you depending on what it is,” and that’s when I knew there’s no way I could fool him.

But honestly, there’s just no way I could put on an act convincing enough to deceive my own friends like Morisawa-Taichou can.

Fuhaha! Experience, it’s all experience! Do you even know how many years I’ve spent imitating heroes for fun?

He’s too good at it in fact, that not even society realizes Morisawa-senpai’s just an imposter acting as a hero.
So they misunderstand and start unreasonably raising the bar for him — to the point that if he shows his true self now, they’ll accuse him of being a liar and a complete fraud… It’s pretty sad.

You understand me far too well, Takamine. It just goes to show how much you love me.

Just die.

Heheh, well, as long as you are obedient, they will not get violent with you, so you will not have to worry about that.
You should maintain composure, while still staying cautious. You will end up getting tired if you are tense all the time, after all.
Look, I am proof of that! It is mainly thanks to Tetora-kun being in charge of the interrogation, but you can see that I am still in perfect physical condition. They will not treat us extremely roughly, despite how things seem around here.

Yeah, I’m really just glad that you remained unharmed all along, Sengoku. That goes for Nagumo, too, of course — but it was extremely concerning when I suddenly lost contact with you back then.

I deeply apologize for that!
However, as you may have noticed, I’m afraid that this building and its surroundings have all signals blocked.

Yeah, they are. We have no contact with the outside world.
I’ve been promoted to the top branch of Crimson Production, so I can walk around some of the areas with a little reception — even the downtown area that’s a little further away.
But in those cases, I’ll be monitored. So I’m always thoroughly inspected to make sure I’m not doing anything suspicious.
You can see how that led me to have no opportunity to get in contact with any of you.
Apparently, it’s because the current head of Crimson Production is extremely paranoid.
I guess he’s just being cautious after having been thoroughly beaten by Oni once before, though.

Oni, huh… Can’t we rely on people from the vigilante group? They’re in opposition to Crimson Production, right?

Yeah. They’re a local vigilante group, but now that the boss has moved to the US, they’ve weakened in power.
They have no chance of opposing Crimson Production with the way they are right now.
But it’s not even that anymore. Right now, Crimson Production is swelling with power by winning over everyone, including the locals who hate ES, and conspiring with them.
At this point, even the former vigilantes from Oni have joined them.
In other words… Crimson Production, once hated and defeated as an evil force in Okinawa, is now seen as justice within the region.
We’d need way more than a half-hearted effort to tear down its stronghold.

Chapter 8
Content Warning: The following chapter contains mentions of murder.

Wait, “tear down its stronghold”…? Don’t tell me you plan to fight… You, against the entirety of Crimson Production?
Why? Let’s just leave this all behind. Nothing good will come out of getting involved with something so dangerous, y’know…?

Yeah, but I’m an employee of Crimson Production now. I’m already heavily involved.
Besides, Crimson Production is an undeniable evil that doesn’t hesitate to commit crimes.
I can’t just go back to a safe and peaceful life and leave my former teammates, the Anti-Stars, to die after getting absorbed into this mess.
I’ll defeat Crimson Production — the evil that pretends to be on the side of justice.
That being said, this is just how I feel. I don’t think you guys need to force yourselves to get involved.
Tomorrow, I’ll turn a blind eye for a moment to let you guys escape. I want you to get some rest today in preparation for that.

Now you’re also being distant… You’ve really inherited all the wrong things…

if we escape, won’t they suspect you, tetora?

There’s nothing I can do to stop that. I don’t have any good excuse for letting you guys go, except to say that I was so careless that you got away.
If that makes me a suspect, well, then I’ll just have to live with the consequences, won’t I?
Fortunately, I got the chance to inform all of you about what’s going on in Okinawa.
The only thing left to do now is for you all to take that information back home with you, so that the outside world, like ES, can take the best course of action.
I’ll also hand over all evidence of wrongdoing at Crimson Production that I’ve gathered throughout my investigation. I’d like you to deliver it to ES.
If all goes well, Crimson Production will be destroyed.
The evil will perish, and justice will prevail.

Haha… It’s such a plain and boring solution, unlike defeating evil monsters with cannons and giant robots and stuff.

No, no… Don’t stay here, Tetora-kun, you should run away with us tomorrow.
If you stick around, and they end up suspecting you as the one who let us go, won’t they do horrible things to you…?

I can’t do that. I refuse to leave the Anti-Stars kids all on their own here.

T-Then let’s run away with them, too—

That won’t be possible. They absolutely loathe ES, and I’d only enrage them if I suggest that they ask ES for help.
Some of them might even tattle on us and go to the upper management of Crimson Production.
They’d rather die than butter up ES to ask for their help.
It’ll be over for all of us if that happens. We won’t be able to get away. They’ll capture every one of us and dispose of us.
I’ve said it several times by now, but I mean it when I say that Crimson Production is an extremely dangerous group of criminals. They don’t hesitate to commit crimes.
They annihilate human beings like it’s nothing — As in murder.
I’ve seen it happen a few times while I’ve worked here.

………

That’s why, the best solution we’ve got is to have everyone in Ryuseitai except me run away and tell ES everything as fast as possible.
I’ll stay here and stall for time until everyone else has escaped and has done the calculations necessary to defeat Crimson Production.
If I escape with you guys, it’ll be completely obvious that I was a traitorous spy. And if that happens, there’s a high chance they’ll destroy any evidence of wrongdoing.
Right now they aren’t on their guard, so there should be a slight weak spot in their defenses, but… If they completely go on the defensive or run away, I doubt we’d be able to round them all up.
If we fail to fully defeat Crimson Production, they might come back someday and conduct their evil deeds again.
In order to prevent such a horrible part of history from repeating itself, we have to defeat them from top to bottom, right here, right now.
—That’s my form of justice.

You think that I’ll be impressed and agree with you if you put it that way, don’t you?

And the matter of fact is, yes — I really am impressed. Mhm, you’ve grown up so much, Nagumo. You’re a worthy hero of justice of your own.
—But unfortunately, there are four other heroes here besides you.

What do you mean…?

It’s the same concept as Supervillains. Although, saying that wouldn’t make enough sense to you, since you’ve had signals cut off for so long, and have been completely isolated from the rest of the world in terms of information.
To put short, in a blockbuster or a crossover with multiple heroes, it’s necessary to unite the justice of all the heroes who appear in the story.
You need to match everyone’s reason and purpose for action, like “to defeat a common enemy,” or “to avenge a mutual friend”.

Well, yeah, that’s how it is. That’s why it’s so difficult to make those sorts of crossovers.

Haha… Indeed, thanks to that, even the blockbuster Supervillains has reached a deadlock.

Oh, I didn’t know… I’ve been so busy with my own work that I haven’t had the chance to catch up on everything.
Is everything going to be okay? Supervillains is referring to the blockbuster that we’re going to be a part of, right?
I saw in the newspaper that they finally announced the title, but…?
Does that mean it isn’t going so well after all?

Yeah, but I’m sure it’ll be alright.
No one is creating this show with the intention of making it boring or to produce a failure.
Everyone involved is working hard to deliver something as good as possible to the audience.
Right now, everyone’s opinions aren’t aligned, so things aren’t going well, but…
Once the direction is set in place, I’m sure things will turn out well. Everyone will do their best in their respective roles, and will definitely be able to produce a wonderful piece of art.

What are you even on about? You suddenly become so enthusiastic whenever it’s about tokusatsu…

No, I’m talking about real life.
I say this to each and every one of you: I know that all this time, I’ve only been dragging you along with talks about my dreams… But from now on, let’s have a proper discussion about reality, too.
Let’s also assemble a happy ending for our reality — an ending that everyone wants to see.







Translation Notes
↑ Combatants refer to the troopers of an antagonist group in a tokusatsu show, and are typically low-level. An example would be the Shocker Combatmen from Kamen Rider.↑ The following scene is related to Meteor Impact.↑ In Japanese, the word he says is hangure, which are groups in Japan that commit crimes, but are not affiliated with any crime syndicates (yakuza, for example).↑ As mentioned earlier, taichou refers to leader (sometimes translated as Captain). It literally means “Commander”. It’s also the title Tetora would call Chiaki by a year ago, when Chiaki was still in high school.↑ Tetora temporarily switches to his typical speech quirk here as part of the light joke. Also, sundome is a type of karate where you have to stop before you hit the target.↑ This is a reference to the story Mirage.]]></content>

Chapter 9


    Next morning. In the agency office of Crimson Production’s headquarters…

(The evil organization starts their morning early.)
(Every morning, you begin by greeting everyone energetically.)

Gooood mooorniiing!!
Morisawa Chiaki from RB, ready for duty!

(You press the timestamp machine to record your attendance, and present yourself to your boss. Then, you ask what you’re supposed to do for the day.)
(As of this moment, the boss in question would be me, the commander of RB.)
Good job.
It’s good that you have energy, but your voice is a little too loud. Keep it down.

Yes, sir! I’m very sorry about that! I’m still not used to working at Crimson Production!

No excuses. When you’re scolded—

I must apologize! It’s all my fault, sir! I’m so sorry!

(You must obey your unreasonable, power-hungry boss. You must never complain.)
(This is the key to succeeding in this company.)
(In fact, these are the conditions set in order to be accepted as part of the team.)
(Those below must obey those that are above. In the same sense as a sports team[1] — as long as you understand how the beasts of the jungle operate—)

good mooorning~!

Shinkai Kanata and Sengoku Shinobu from RB, reporting for duty!

Good. …There’s still one person missing, though?
Is “Takamine” skipping out on work?

ah~… midori appears to be feeling [unwell].

Indeed, he did not seem to have any energy. Maybe he caught a cold from the sudden change in environment?

That’s still inexcusable. All of you, including “Morisawa” — Follow after me. We’ll shake him out of bed.

Roger that, Taichou!

As you command, O magnificent RB-Taichou!

There’s no need for flattery. If you have the time to butter me up, you’re better off spending it doing your job.
We don’t have enough hands in Crimson Production as it is, do you understand?
You lot are just replacements to fill our shortage in staff. You’ll be dispatched to your respective departments according to my instruction.
There, you’ll be performing minor chores for us.
(…And this is how they’ll be able to go in and out of various departments and explore the inner workings of Crimson Production in greater depth and detail. Since the work will be divided between the five of us, our investigation will advance at rapid speed.)
(We’ll be able to gather assets to attack Crimson Production far more sharply and effectively.)
…Of course, that won’t be your primary job.
When I call for you, you must put aside your other duties and assemble before me.
You will work as RB, idols representing Crimson Production, and earn money for the agency.

Yes, sir! Everything is for the sake of RB — for the glory of Ryuseitai Black!

for [crimson production]!

For our magnificent Nagumo Tetora-Taichou!

Enough with the flattery already. Let’s just go and get the job done.

Ossu, roger that!

(Sigh… I feel like it’s way too obvious, as if they’re clearly forcing themselves to fit the role. Well, as long as nobody catches on that we’re only pretending to be evil.)
(And anyway… I’m sure it’ll be alright.)
(Surprisingly, nobody really cares much about what’s going on with other people.)
(I can’t speak for the fans who have been following us for a long time and paying attention to every detail…)
(But when it comes to the people here in Crimson Production — people who’ve become obsessed with anti-ES ideology…)
(People who’ve either been looking at us with a biased view from the beginning, or avoid looking at us entirely because they find us distasteful—)
(The more they steep in their hatred, the more blinded they become, unable to see anything but what they want to see. They only believe what they want to believe.)
(The only thing that matters to them is that we betrayed ES and switched over to Crimson Production.)
(Which means, to them, that we’re on their side.)
(The people here are short-sighted. They color-code the world according to whether they’re friend or foe, and assume that allies are good and enemies are evil.)
(…I used to live with a worldview as simple as that practically all my life, so to some extent, I can read the feelings and thoughts of these types of people. I can’t say I’m proud of that, though…)
(Of course, it’s no small matter that all of Ryuseitai has betrayed ES to join Crimson Production.)
(It honestly sounds too unlikely for it to be possible. We’re one of the main earners in ES, after all. It wouldn’t be weird to think, “How could such an important group of people turn on their previous company just like that?”)
(So I’m sure some of them will start to suspect us.)
(But there’s already Anti-Stars and I as legitimate proof that this is possible… and all of us were able to gain the trust of the Crimson Production staff over time.)
(So now, if I can succeed in leading the Ryuseitai members properly, they should also be able to blend in with Crimson Production.)
(In fact… That’s the very thing that we, RB—)
(The very mission that Ryuseitai must fulfill.)

Chapter 10


    A few minutes later. Within the Crimson Production building, at the film studio…

midori~! come on out~!

Your mother is crying for you!

You’re completely surrounded! There’s nowhere for you to escape! Fuhahahaha!! ☆

…You guys are just enjoying yourselves at this point.

Oh, there you are. Where were you even hiding?

There’s a hole under the building that’s big enough for me to hide in…
It was turned into a tunnel by the looks of it, and you can get to another area without being caught by the cameras…
Maybe they used it as an evacuation spot for the actors whenever gunpowder was used during filming… I wouldn’t really know, though.

Huh, I didn’t even know that existed. A tunnel… Maybe we could use it as an escape route, as a last resort.

Nah, I doubt this would connect all the way to the outside… They wouldn’t choose this place for our confinement if that was possible.

That would be a little too careless on their side, yeah.

Anyway, I did as you told me to… Was that enough?

Yeah. We were all supposed to come back here to call over “Midori-kun”, who refuses to come in for work.
Until we persuade him to come, we can move around freely. We can have private discussions here without being seen, since we also know where the surveillance cameras are.
They may catch on if we keep repeating this over and over again, but it should still be okay for now. Midori-kun’s famous for being the “unmotivated character”.

Yeah. In fact, it’s really surprising that even Takamine stuck around in this dangerous place. He could’ve run back to ES as soon as he had the chance…
He’s been a man with an element of surprise this time around.

If you’re actually surprised, then that just means you never once understood me.
Besides, we all decided that we’d stay here together. I don’t wanna be the only one who’s left out.

Yeah. Let’s all work together to accomplish this mission.

chiaki~ you are not [allowed] to make any [orders]. tetora is the [taichou] right now.

Ah, right. Sorry about that.
Nagumo, please don’t hesitate to order us around. We’ll follow your instructions.

I’m not too keen on pushing even my own seniors around, but… I have to suck it up for now. We don’t have a choice.

—We betrayed ES.
First it was me, then “Shinobu-kun”, and then later on the other three defected one after the other.
We transferred to Crimson Production, a major entertainment agency that rules over Okinawa.
That’s what’s going to be announced to the public soon enough, and so far the people at Crimson Production don’t seem to suspect us.
Once we all moved to the new company, we changed our unit name from “Ryuseitai” to “RB”.
This is because we would’ve faced problems with procedures if we performed under the same name — Not to mention, our fans would’ve been confused, too.

We just went from “Ryuseitai” to “Ryuseitai Black”… I don’t feel like much has changed.

I like it, it reminds me of Kamen Rider!

I’m aware it’s a cheap name. I didn’t have the time to come up with something good, let alone the reason or need for it.
…I just badly wanted everyone to know how terrible the situation is.
Crimson Production is more or less an entertainment company, so on the front, it’s also involved in the production of programs and such.
And I got the opportunity to perform in their program as an idol, all the while being an undercover spy.

Ah, I get it now. The base of Crimson Production — as in, the headquarters building — is isolated from the outside world in terms of signals.
Letters and other forms of communication can easily be censored, and Okinawa is too far from ES for you to rush back here to relay information through normal methods.

Yeah, exactly. I didn’t have the means to inform anyone what was happening.
So I went on their program as an idol. That was the only way I could tell everyone what was going on.
If I made a questionable statement there, like saying that I’m leaving Ryuseitai, it would definitely become a topic of conversation. If it becomes a topic, all of you would then be able to get the information.
“A member of the powerhouse ‘Ryuseitai’ parted from ES.”
News like that is also really good for Crimson Production, since it’s an anti-ES organization.
They won’t manipulate the information. In fact, they would actively promote it.
And I knew everyone in Ryuseitai would come to this place themselves to confirm the situation as soon as they heard about this report.
Once you’ve arrived, I’d then capture you. Then, after I’ve handed you all the evidence I’ve gathered of Crimson Production’s illegal activities, I’d secretly let you escape out of here.
That was the original plan. From then, I’d just have to wait until ES got to work with the evidence of illegal activity, and have Crimson Production shut down for good.
And while stalling for time, I’d have to make sure that the evidence wouldn’t get destroyed.
All in order to defeat the evil organization, Crimson Production.

Chapter 11
Content Warning: The following chapters contain heavy discussion of self-loathing and self-destruction.

You were going to cross a dangerous bridge… However, you had concluded that Crimson Production can’t be defeated unless you do so, right?

Maybe it was just a dumb plan thought up by an idiot… I just couldn’t think of any other way.
But I think I managed to make it work pretty well, if I do say so myself.
I mean, I genuinely had everyone convinced that I was a complete traitor, 100% anti-ES. I was careful not to let anyone know my true intentions.
After all, they would’ve killed me if they found out I was a spy. I was desperate to make this plan work.

I know I’m really late in saying this, but this isn’t even idol work anymore, is it?

Yeah, it really isn’t. I don’t think ES expected me to get this deeply involved, either.
I’m sure they thought I’d just gather the information they needed and get myself out of here.
But… I couldn’t abandon my old comrades, Anti-Stars, who were suffering in this place.
So I started thinking of ways to save those kids. I knew that in order to do that, I needed to expose the dark side of Crimson Production and have them shut down.
And I was going to do whatever I thought was necessary to achieve that.
As earnestly as possible, and with every ounce of effort in my body.

That’s exactly what makes you who you are, Nagumo. You really are an earnest and straight-forward boy.
However, the plan you devised is much too dangerous for you. You’re up against a criminal organization that’s as terrifying as an actual organized crime enterprise. You’d be dead in an instant were you to fail.
We cherish you as much as you cherish your own comrades, including those in Anti-Stars.
When you’re hurt or sad, we’re hurt and saddened just as much, if not more.
I know you couldn’t think of any other way this time, but if possible, please don’t cross such a dangerous bridge like this ever again.
While self-sacrifice is what makes a hero… Unlike me, you never wanted to become a hero, did you?

…Ossu. You’re the last person I’d ever want to preach to me about “not being self-sacrificial,” but…
All I ever wanted to be was someone I could be proud of — someone I could love.


—I’ve always hated myself.
I’m sure you’ve all come to realize this about me by now, but I’ve always been extremely incompetent and stupid. No matter how hard I tried, I could never accomplish anything.
I had no capability of doing anything, and the harder I tried, the more I failed… The saying, “Love is our greatest teacher,” didn’t apply to me.
I love cooking, and I’ve been working hard on my cooking skills for a long time, but I’m sure you all know what the food I make is like.
I’m even aware that on the school trip, everyone put up with my food and forced themselves to eat it.[2]
They ate every bit of it for my sake, with smiles on their faces, even though I’m sure it tasted awful…
But I was really, genuinely trying to make it taste good.

That’s always how it’s been for me, for every single thing. I just couldn’t get anything right. It didn’t matter how hard I tried, it would all go to waste in the end. I wouldn’t get any proper results, so I’d just give up and let it go half-way in.
I just kept doing that, over and over again. Everyone around me, even my parents, probably thought I was nothing but a spineless kid with no real ambition.
That’s why my parents made me learn karate, to build up my spirit.
And I didn’t really get anywhere with that, either, so I quit it right after.
But at the time, I was able to at least pretend I was working hard by going to the dojo every day.
…Even though I wasn’t gaining anything. I wasn’t growing at all. I was always a white belt…
Even then, I was still able to pretend that I was trying, that I was growing.

My parents were relieved to see me try, and praised me a lot for it — Just like Morisawa-senpai does.
“You’re working so hard, Tetora.” “You really can do it if you try, Tetora.” “You’re amazing, Tetora.”
……Do you not realize how stupid that is?

………

I’m not amazing, not even close. I’m just stuck in the same spot. Everyone would always praise me, but I was the only one who could tell it wasn’t ever true.
I was the only person I couldn’t fool.
I’m hollow inside with only a polished surface, and everyone around me saw that surface and praised me for “doing my best” and for being “a good boy”.
All the while… Deep inside, the real me would stare at my fake self with cold, dead eyes.
Ever since I was a little kid, that feeling has never once left me.

Chapter 12
I love my parents and my friends. I was surrounded by nothing but kind, wonderful people.
My parents have always praised me and loved me. To this very day, they both work from morning to night, day in and day out, to earn money for my tuition and living expenses.
Like me, they aren’t very good at what they do, and they don’t seem to make much money, no matter how hard they try.
Even so, they listened to my desires and allowed me to enroll at Yumenosaki. They paid the high entrance fee and provided me with everything I needed.

The reason I decided to go to Yumenosaki was because I was passionate about idols at that time.
But, even then… It’s only because, during the time I was half-heartedly trying various things and not accomplishing anything, becoming an idol happened to be what I was aiming for at that moment.
And what made me stick to that goal was because a friend told me something like, “You have good looks, Tetora. Why don’t you become an idol?”
He was just saying something that fit the mood at the time, and I ended up hopping on the thought, as well.
My parents and friends were so supportive that I just couldn’t back out… that’s all there was to it.
I didn’t want to betray the expectations my beloved parents and friends had for me. I didn’t want to damper the mood and have them hate me.

I really hate myself. So if those around me don’t love me, don’t care for me, then I have no reason to exist.
I despise myself — so if everyone around me gives up on me, I’ll no longer be loved by anyone.
And if nobody loves you… what’s even the point in living?
I was terrified of that happening to me.
To become someone unneeded, unloved, unseen by everyone—
I was already such a hollow person, so close to fading away. I couldn’t stand the thought of that happening for real.
…It’s a common fear for a teenager. But for me, it was a severely serious problem.

Tetora-kun…

Haha. That’s why I got so angry at you, Midori-kun[3]… It’s like I could see the real me in you — my pathetic self, that I hide in the pit of my stomach.
And yet, I felt like you had everything I ever wanted. You have way better looks than me, and with just a little effort, you could do anything, you know?
I couldn’t help but think it was so unfair.
That, like, if you don’t want it that badly, you should just give me your talent and your beautiful face.

Should I say sorry…?

No, don’t. If you apologize, I’ll feel even more miserable about myself, and then get unreasonably upset and punch you.
But in reality, the real person I want to punch is myself.
For never being able to grow up — for always being such an uncool person.
To be honest, karate used to be a force of habit for me once upon a time, but the sensei who taught me gave me a bit of his word of wisdom. He told me that learning martial arts is not for the purpose of beating up a loathsome enemy.
He said it’s for personal growth.
It’s a common enough saying that it could’ve come from anyone, but, even then… I intend to aim my well-trained fists inwards, and beat up my weak self.
That way, I could grow, even if only a little.
This wasn’t out of a need to do a noble self-sacrifice, like Morisawa-senpai mentioned. I&#39;m able to cross as many dangerous bridges as I want because I hate myself and don’t see myself as anything worthwhile.
Even if I were to get badly hurt and fade away, I wouldn’t have regretted any of it for even a second. It would’ve felt refreshing, even.

Nagumo…

Yeah, don’t worry. I’m no longer desperate enough to put myself through any of that.
I have friends and comrades who love me. I have juniors who admire me and depend on me. I have fans who pay attention to me and want to see more of me.
That’s why… Maybe I was just making the wrong conclusion all along, but… I now believe that even I’m worth something.


Morisawa-senpai. Shinkai-senpai. Midori-kun. Shinobu-kun.
I love each and every one of you. I respect all of you — you never give up no matter what, and no matter how far down you are, you always crawl back up with all your effort. You’re always shining so brightly.
You, who are all so dazzling like that, recognize me as an equal comrade, that I’ve even started to think I’ve got something of my own inside me—
I can feel that way about myself now, from the bottom of my heart.
Thanks to you guys, I’ve come to like myself a little bit.
But… I want to grow to love myself more and more.
I want to make an actual effort to do so.
When I was all alone, I would just settle with pretending to work hard.
But if everyone lends me their support, I feel like I can succeed for real this time.
That’s why… Please, Ryuseitai — believe in me for just this moment, and entrust your lives to me.
I swear to you — This time around, I won’t make any bit of that go to waste.

Chapter 13


    A week later. Within the city, at the Supervillains promotion concert venue…

“The black flame is the embodiment of destruction! Burning everything before it to a crisp…!”
“Ryusei Black! Nagumo Tetora!”

“The black heart is the embodiment of the wicked! Loathing all humans and all sins!”
“Ryusei Black No.2, Morisawa Chiaki!”

“the black [water] is the embodiment of [disease]! drink it, and you will get a [stomachache]!”
“ryusei black, number three! shinkai kanata!”

“The embodiment of the blackened earth and great nature! Ryusei Black No.4, Takamine Midori!”


“Ryusei Black No.5! The embodiment of the black darkness! Sengoku Shinobu! Nin-nin…♪”

“We are the embodiments of evil, who have come from the depths of the jet black darkness! We’re the unprecedented Supervillains! We are known as: RB, Ryuseitai Black!”
“♪~♪~♪”

…Sigh… We finally made it.
I’ve reached my limit. I’m so exhausted. I’m tired of pretending to be a bad guy, I’m tired of working with corrupted people.
I couldn’t get a wink of sleep at night ‘cause I was terrified that they’d find out we were spies and kill us… Like, actually kill us. For real.

fufufu~ it was like we were in the [belly] of a [monster], wasn’t it?
anyone with a proper [nervous] system would collapse, yes?

Yeah… Which basically proves that I’m the only one in Ryuseitai who’s actually proper… Like, seriously, why’re you all so enthusiastic?
I’m terrified… I’m so scared of how the public will react… I haven’t been checking social media as per usual, but I’m absolutely certain they’re completely put off by us…
If the worst is happening, we’re being slandered right this second… And at best, our fans are definitely baffled… I’m sure they’re talking about how nobody ever wanted to see Ryuseitai fall into the hands of evil or something—

Ahaha. Midori-kun, your eyes are colored with dark circles.

He’s hiding it with makeup, though. He’s literally Ryusei Black, huh?

You ass… Whose fault do you think that is, huh…?

Guys, let’s stop the chit-chat here.
I’m not the one leading us this time around as I’m Ryusei Black No.2 in the end, and I know the commander of RB is “Nagumo-Taichou,” but — I need to remind you all that it’s a race against time now.

Ossu, we are aware.

osu~♪

Umm, you don’t have to imitate me just because you go by “Ryusei Black,” you know…?

yes, but~ it is surprisingly [fun] to [imitate] someone~♪

Exactly what a “transformation” is all about.

Well, it works as a good rehearsal for the filming of Supervillains…
With the usual Ryuseitai, I don’t really get to play as a villain ‘cause Morisawa-senpai doesn’t like those roles much, so this feels new…
Ahh~ It’s sooo much easier to play the villain~ You don’t have to worry about all kinds of things~…♪
I don’t have to preach about justice or morality or whatever else I don’t even believe in.

Y-You disliked playing the hero of justice that much!? You could’ve told me so!

Did it look like we could ever mention that?

Yeah. The usual Ryuseitai that everyone loves was created by Morisawa-senpai back in his generation. He broke the old ties and swept away the horrible practices.
That was how Morisawa-senpai was able to make Ryuseitai be reborn — as the ideal hero sentai, just as he wished it to be.
We were then picked up, accepted, and loved. Morisawa-senpai made us the characters of his dream.
We were never able to become villains that are evil enough to repay such kindness with malice.

But… Tragedies happen even when no one is at fault. We know that all too well by now, don’t we?
Five people alone can’t destroy all the evil in the world.

We’ve been battered, defeated, and made to look pathetic by the face of reality.
Who do we curse at? Crazy:B, for being the first ones to sling mud at us?
The bigwigs at StarPro, who at this point only want to stop us from going down our rightful path? Crimson Production, for their constant crimes?
Or the idiot Morisawa-senpai, who tried to take in all the hatred during Comet Show by taking on a role unsuited for him and becoming the villain?

(He casually called me an idiot… Mm, I really am an idiot though, aren’t I?)
(We’re such idiotic, weak, foolish, tiny beings that it’s almost absurd to call ourselves heroes.)

(But even so—)

But even so, if we give up and surrender unconditionally to evil, there will truly be no more heroes in this world.
—There were no heroes in this world.
That can no longer be applied to the present. That was why Morisawa-senpai, who loves heroes, tried to exist as one.
Once a bullied kid, who would only suffer torment from others, Morisawa-senpai then transformed into a hero.
Because, “if there are no heroes in this world, then I will become the hero.”

(Ahh… That’s right. That’s exactly what it was.)
(That was all I ever wanted to do.)

And that’s why I respect you, Morisawa-senpai. I admire you, and I love you. I have no actual capabilities and I’m terrible at producing results through my effort, so I can’t be you no matter how hard I try.
I can’t become a hero that’s exactly like you.
—That&#39;s why I’m fine with being Black.
I want to be Black.

I can’t be a replacement for the embodiment of justice — It’s impossible for me to play the cool hero, as the deep red-costumed leading role in your stead.
I’ve come to understand that that’s impossible. I’ve spent this whole year having that badgered in my head.

So I’ll leave that all to you — Morisawa-senpai.
And as for me, I’ll do what only I can do. I’ll do it with all my might.
I may end up just spinning my wheels all over again and getting nothing out of it, but—
That’s still way better than hiding behind your back and being protected by you all the time.
If I keep walking without ever stopping, I’m sure I’ll reach somewhere.
I’ll believe in that. I’ll pour all my hope into it.

Chapter 14
So… I’m leaving this red uniform with you for now.
This is the color you should be wearing.

That makes me happy to hear, but… Are you sure, Nagumo-Taichou? That would ruin our plans, wouldn’t it?

Yeah, I know. Originally, we were going to do something like a long-delayed “Ryusei Red Inheritance Ceremony” here. For real this time, in a super flashy way.
Our justice-loving fans would call out to us, who have been drenched in evil.
“Go back to the way you all were!” “Don’t let evil win!” “Restore the heart of justice!”
Through those cheers, our blackened corrupted selves would then regain our original colors. Shinkai-senpai is Blue, Midori-kun is Green, Shinobu-kun is Yellow—
I would then inherit red from Morisawa-senpai, and Morisawa-senpai would put on a new color.

Yeah. We were supposed to have done this kind of ceremony much, much earlier, truthfully.

Yeah, because it feels way too late now… It’s too shamelessly obvious, and even once I go back to the side of justice, I’d still rather keep my color black.
Besides, if I become Red, I would be going against the agency’s desire to have Ryuseitai return to the old formation, with Morisawa-senpai as Red.
To be honest, I’m not keen on the idea at all.

As our reward for defeating the great evil Crimson Production, we’re going to push our own will onto them. We’re going to make them agree to do what we want to do.
—That was our plan. But honestly… Morisawa-senpai, you just want to give it back to me to be at peace, since you’re the one who took red away from me — don’t you?

When you put it that way… there’s nothing I could say to refute that.

I know I’m repeating myself, but I’m fine with the way things are right now. I can’t say I’m satisfied, but I have no interest in wearing the red color by brute force.
I want to dress in the color that best suits me.
I’d like you to at least let me wear what I want to wear.
Ignoring my wishes and forcing me to wear clothes I don’t even want to wear is just an adult’s — your ego.

………

Please, let me do what I want to do now. I’m happy that you feel that way, and I’m grateful for it — but right now, it’s just getting in my way.
Within Crimson Production, we succeeded in being obedient members of their community. We were then recognized, appreciated and promoted.
As people who betrayed ES, and were a former powerhouse unit in the agency — We’re the perfect poster children for the anti-ES organization, Crimson Production.
We could become a great weapon against ES.
If former members of ES were to repeatedly criticize the company, ES’s authority would surely be damaged. We might even have a lot of idols and fans sympathize with us, and follow in our footsteps.
And so, all the wealth that ES has would be swiped away by Crimson Production. We may see an unprecedented migration in the whole industry.
There’s even a possibility that Crimson Production could replace ES as the dominant player in the industry and the whole world.
That’s what Crimson Production concluded, and that’s why they’re backing us up in every manner.
They decided that this would be their shining moment, and invested all their money into us so that we may do what we want.
They even became one of the biggest investors for the blockbuster Supervillains, which was in a deadlock prior to this.
Money may not be able to solve everything in the world, but there are a lot of problems that can be solved with money.

Yeah, because having no money is the same as having no head. Though that also means that as long as you have a head, you can survive.
Take Supervillains, for example. It had come to a halfway standstill due to the disputes of all parties involved, but it might start moving forward if a large amount of gasoline in the form of money is poured into it.

Yeah, and it really did happen. Supervillains has regained enough vitality to hold a promotional event for the project like this.
All thanks to the glorious Crimson Production, huh?

Yeah, Crimson Production likely intends to use Supervillains itself as propaganda to crush ES.
We should never underestimate fictional works. The influence of creative work on reality is massive.
This is referring to the Showa era[4], but… There was once a scary-looking actor who played the villain in a tokusatsu show, and he spoke about personal anecdotes where he made children cry even when he was simply walking around town.
Within Supervillains, you could have an evil organization or monster that makes you think, “This is clearly meant to be ES.”
If you thoroughly depict them in an evil way, that impression will be imprinted on the public.

Ahaha. And if we, RB of Crimson Production, were to defeat the evil ES in a glorious scene, it’d be foolproof.
Even a kid would be able to tell who’s righteous and who’s evil — even if that was far from the truth.

But before we let them… Before they twist the facts—
We’ll betray Crimson Production on this very stage.

Yeah, that’s the plan we settled on.
We were actually spies sent by ES to investigate the evil organization, Crimson Production.
The way we acted like traitors to ES, behaved like villains, and called ourselves RB — That was all part of an act.
We have always been Morisawa-senpai’s favorite heroes of justice, and had never been tainted by evil.
We’re going to make a big announcement to state that, in a safe place far from Okinawa. At the same time, we’re going to present the evidence we’ve gathered and denounce Crimson Production as an evil organization.

Yeah. Tenshouin and the rest of the staff have already heard of the news, and are all sitting in the VIP seats right now. He likely has a perfect grasp of our true intentions.
I expect that he’ll assist us as we make our move. After all, if we can bring down the anti-ES organization Crimson Production, it’d be beneficial to him as well.

that is [relieving], then. i cannot help but find it a bit [frustrating] to be helped by that person, but…
on the other hand, we can have him [atone] for the horrible things he has done to the [five eccentrics] through this.

Chapter 15
Conveniently, the story in Supervillains and our current situation coincide perfectly.
The heroes of justice turn evil—
But in the end, those evil-tainted heroes awaken to justice once more.
Evil becomes justice, villains become heroes, RB becomes Ryuseitai—
And so, we could say that we were simply playing the role of “heroes who had been tainted with evil” in real life, in line with the base setting of Supervillains.
We shall force this into a factual truth, and convince society into accepting it.

Will they really be convinced…? Isn’t it too aggressive?
Like… “We tried to replicate this exact storyline in real life, too! What do you think? Isn’t it interesting?” — Wouldn’t that be a little offensive? It’s too tasteless of a joke, don’t you think…?

Well… We’ll just have to be patient and persistently explain to the public that we had no other choice.
What’s important here is that we fulfill our duty, whether forcefully or otherwise.
We’re going to expose Crimson Production to the light of day and bring them to justice. And at the same time, we’ll all return back, safe and sound.

We have all of Anti-Stars accompanying us in a backup dancer-like position, too. They all still believe that we betrayed ES, though.
So when they find out that we were spies for ES all along, they’ll likely get angry at us.
Regardless, we can’t afford to have their lives at risk. We’ll protect those kids and keep them somewhere safe, where the evil hands of Crimson Production can’t reach them.
As Morisawa-senpai said, it’s a race against time from here on out.
Speed and timing are critical. We’ll present the evidence of Crimson Production’s evil, expose the truth, and reveal their true identity.
This stage is getting a lot of publicity and attention, so it’s impossible for Crimson Production to cover it up.
There’ll definitely be an investigation by the police and other authorities to confirm the facts.
With the evidence of the misdeeds we uncovered in hand, of course. It seems that Tenshouin-senpai’s already working with the police, so there probably won’t be time for the evidence to get destroyed.
Everything will be taken care of in the blink of an eye. Crimson Production will fall.
This time around, they’ll absolutely be destroyed without a trace.

And everyone will live happily ever after……

your [face] does not seem to reflect that thought, does it?

I think you played an incredible role in this whole plan, Tetora-kun. I don’t think the problem would have been solved without you. You should be proud of your achievements and efforts.

Mhm, mhm. I barely had to do anything this time, y’know? And yet, here I am, getting to look like I’ve accomplished something…♪
Life is so nice and easy when someone else does all the work to solve the problem without you ever lifting a finger.

You weren’t having an easy time either, though. You’re so worn out that you have circles under your eyes, Takamine. You did your best, too. We all did our best.

Mmm~… But I feel like I’m a little too naive after all…
I feel like no matter how hard I try to stick to my guns, I’ll always be a halfwit who can’t be fully dyed by either evil or justice.
I can’t help but think… Was this really the right thing to do?
We’ve now stacked up one betrayal after the other… After all the support Crimson Production provided us, we’re going to loot their money and run away with it. From an outside perspective, we’re no better than petty thieves.

Is it not possible to interpret our act as something similar to what chivalrous thieves do, like Ishikawa Goemon or Nezumi Kozo?
They were the type of thieves who would take money and treasure from the bad guys, and distribute them to the common people.

Well, it would be better for my mental health to think that way, yeah…
But… I’ve been undercover at Crimson Production longer than all of you.
I’ve been in contact with the staff there. I spent many days with them, and worked with them.
That’s why I know — that even though they belonged to an evil organization, they weren’t all corrupt and evil people from the bottom of their hearts.

There were a lot of good people, too. They helped me out when I made mistakes in my work… They gave me extra food at the cafeteria… We even did workouts together at the gym.
We had a lot of casual conversations with each other. They were all ordinary people, not so different from me.
So is it really okay to crush all those people under the name of justice for our own personal reasons…?
I don’t know… I can’t tell anymore.

You’re a little off the mark there, Nagumo.
While I may have spoken critically of the former members of Ryuseitai, I’m aware that they weren’t really evil people.
They were just ordinary people, who wanted to play around and enjoy themselves. They liked fun and despised hardship.
However… The environment — the organization they’re in — turns such ordinary people into evil.
What we need to defeat, or simply improve, is the environment itself.
The very system within the world that taints ordinary people with evil.


And as for you — You’re trying to achieve that exact sort of justice by denouncing Crimson Production.
You should be proud of yourself. Personally, I want to praise you for every single bit of your effort.
You did incredible work, Nagumo Tetora.
You are my — our pride and joy.
You’re a splendid, cool hero — a wonderful person to look up to.
And I can assure you that I’m not saying any of this to coddle you.

…Ossu.
Thank you, Senpai. Thank you for always watching over me and appreciating me.
But… That’s exactly why I can’t be your successor right now. I’m not able to take over your position and wear the red uniform.
If I set you as the pinnacle of my ideals, as my end point—
I’ll never be able to surpass you.

This time around, I’ve walked my own path away from you. A pitch dark path[5] that you haven’t explored yet — a path that you can’t even set foot in.
—The path of evil.
And that’s where I finally felt something change in me — I saw the possibility that I could surpass you and become greater than you.
I may even be able to defeat enemies that the kind and gentle you never could. I may even be able to save you when you’re in trouble.
I may be able to defeat something that hurts you, agonizes you, and makes you sad.
I want to walk down this road for a while longer, so that I can become — so that I can transform into a version of myself that could do that. I want to get covered in mud, desperately wade through the muck, and move forward—
Then I’ll grasp onto something, and become a bigger man than you’ve ever been.
No, it’s not even about that, really. That’s exactly who I want to be.


I’ll become someone that I can love. Even if it’s hard for me now, someday, for sure…
I can no longer walk down the path you so carefully paved for me. We tried to go down that road altogether, but we ended up causing a car accident and a traffic jam in the process.
That’s why — I’m going to go down my own path.
But I’m certain of one thing — Our paths will surely lead us all down to the exact same destination.

 1/3

I’m being asked to take jobs after graduation by the people I work with in the industry.
Thanks to their help, I won’t have so much trouble with work for awhile.
Tenshouin lent me a hand too, which has helped me become one step closer to my dreams.


    
        
            It’s going to get exciting, huh.
        
        
			
				Possibility 1
				Possibility 2
			
			
            	Yeah. I still have worries over the obstacles I’ll face, but I don’t plan on giving up the dream I’ve had since I was young!
I’ll be glad if you could continue to support me, even after I’ve graduated…☆
                    

			
			
            	Yeah! Now I can relax a little…
…At least, I thought I could, but I’m just so worried about those three right now.
Will they be fine on their own…?
                

			
        
    
	
        
            Are you going to become a hero?
        
        
			
				Possibility 1
				Possibility 2
			
			
            	I can’t become a hero in a tokusatsu show just like that.
But if anything happens to you, feel free to call for me.
I’ve always been your hero, after all! ☆
                

			
			
            	I’ve got my start line for now.
It’ll take a while before I can become a fully perfected hero.
For the most part, I’ll be doing idol activities…☆
                

			
        
    

 2/3

Mm, I can’t believe Takamine saw me that day…
I’m embarrassed at how hard I tried to put up a front to be cool…

It actually makes me look pathetic instead, doesn’t it…?


    
        
            That’s not true.
        
        
			
				Possibility 1
				Possibility 2
			
			
            	R-Really…?
I prefer to avoid showing my shameful side to the kids, but for some reason, it’s relieving hearing that from you…♪
                    

			
			
            	Are you trying to comfort me? Thank you, Anzu!

              Graduations really are sad.
I wanted to at least stand proud in front of the kids, and yet… I’m so pathetic.
                

			
        
    
	
        
            Please stay the way you are.
        
        
			
				Possibility 1
				Possibility 2
			
			
            	Huh!? Do you mean that I should keep being pathetic!?
You have moments where you say horrid things like they’re nothing, don’t you…?
Even if it is pathetic, I want to keep up the cool act at least for these final days.
                

			
			
            	Do you mean that being this way is also cool in itself…?
You give some great advice. As you&#39;d expect from a producer!
Let me praise you! Good job, good job! ♪
                

			
        
    

 3/3

I thought those three would be fine on their own, but there were a few moments that were cutting it extremely close.

But they aren’t kids anymore. I’m sure they’ll be able to take care of Ryuseitai.
And Kanata and I will be able to graduate without any worries…☆


    
        
            Ryuseitai will definitely be okay.
        
        
			
				Possibility 1
				Possibility 2
			
			
            	Yeah! There’s no need to worry about those three anymore! ☆
Graduating and leaving your beloved kids behind really feels lonely, though…
To be honest, what I really want from the bottom of my heart is to spend more days with you and Ryuseitai in this academy.
                    

			
			
            	I’m sure those three will continue to shape Ryuseitai in their own way.
Kanata and I both believe in that!
So please keep watching over them as their producer for us…☆
                

			
        
    
	
        
            I’m truly indebted to you.
        
        
			
				Possibility 1
				Possibility 2
			
			
            	Anzu, don’t look so sad.
It’s a hero’s duty to make people smile, so please let me fulfill it!
So that your smile becomes everyone’s strength…♪
                

			
			
            	You&#39;re going to make me blush if you say that so eagerly…♪
But I’m the one who’s indebted to you. I’m sure I put a lot of work on you.
Let me say the same thing back: Thank you…☆

 1/3

Anzu! What’s up? What are you doing here?
Oho, have you come to see the gallant figure of the basketball captain?
This may be your last chance, so let it imprint right into your very eyes…☆


    
        
            That isn’t why I’m here.
        
        
			
				Possibility 1
				Possibility 2
			
			
            	Mhm, mhm, I understand completely. You’re embarrassed, aren’t you?
…Woah!? Why’re you hitting me without saying anything!?
Fuhaha! You really are like a tomboy! ☆
                    

			
			
            	Mhm, you were looking for Akehoshi for something, I see.
He’s gone to buy himself a drink, so he isn’t here.
He’ll likely be back if you wait around, though.
                

			
        
    
	
        
            …It’s going to be lonely.
        
        
			
				Possibility 1
				Possibility 2
			
			
            	So that’s it, I see, I see!
But there’s no reason to feel lonely — This is no eternal parting!
Alright! I’m going to hug you tightly with all my gratitude for everything you&#39;ve done! ☆
                

			
			
            	M-Mmm… Please don’t take what I said so seriously.
I did say it lightly, but—… I’m sorry about that.
I-If you keep looking so sad, I won’t know how to deal with this…
                

			
        
    

 2/3

Ooh, Anzu! You&#39;re here at just the right time!

The truth is, I was on my way to the Student Council office with Kanata, but we strayed off somewhere in the middle…
Have you seen him anywhere?


    
        
            I haven’t seen him.
        
        
			
				Possibility 1
				Possibility 2
			
			
            	I see. Just where did he go off to?
…Oh, the figure I see over there looks to be Kanata?
Anzu, sorry for stopping you for this! Farewell…!
                    

			
			
            	Ahh, honestly, I can’t take my eyes off of him for one second.
Oh well, if I wait here at the corridor, we’ll surely meet each other again.
Would you like to chat until Kanata comes back? ☆
                

			
        
    
	
        
            I saw him a second ago right over there.
        
        
			
				Possibility 1
				Possibility 2
			
			
            	Ooh, so that’s where he was. Seems like he’s talking to someone.
I’m glad I got to find him without too much trouble, and it’s all thanks to you.
Thank you, I’m grateful…☆
                

			
			
            	Hmmm? Is he looking through the window…?
Oh right, you can see the fountain from that window, right? He can really be troublesome when it comes to this.
…Woah!! I think he’s planning to dive in from here!! I-I’m going to go stop him…!!
                

			
        
    

 3/3

Huh, there really are heart-shaped ornaments wherever you go…
Oh right, it’s going to be white day soon. I almost forgot!
Anzu, what do you want as your white day gift?


    
        
            Please give me work.
        
        
			
				Possibility 1
				Possibility 2
			
			
            	Hmmm, so you want work. But Ryuseitai has nothing going on right now…
And I’ve left Repayment Festival to the kids, since it&#39;s junior-focused…
So I&#39;m sorry to say that there isn’t any work I can give you.
                    

			
			
            	Hahaha, you really do love work, don’t you! ☆
But sadly, there’s nothing I’m doing for my unit right now.
Alright then! How about I go find out if there’s anything you could do…♪
                

			
        
    
	
        
            The thought is what counts…
        
        
			
				Possibility 1
				Possibility 2
			
			
            	There’s nothing you specifically want, huh…
But I won’t be satisfied with that.
There’s no need to rush, so if you find something you want, tell me.
                

			
			
            	Hm, the thought… That’s tricky somehow.
But letting your feelings be known is the most important thing!
Anzu, thank you for everything…☆

 1/3

Sigh… I&#39;m so tired…
Why do I have to go to the basketball court when it&#39;s so cold outside…
I just wanna go home and relax…


    
        
            G-Good luck!

            	If all it took was a cheer, I wouldn&#39;t be suffering this much, y&#39;know…
 Ah, but if you cheered me on in a mascot costume, I might get the motivation…♪
 Could you please wear it sometime, Anzu-san?
                    

			
			
            	There&#39;s nothing to work hard for, though… I can&#39;t be bothered.
 I&#39;m just not motivated somehow, I just feel depressed instead…
 But this is the last time we&#39;re together, so I&#39;ll suck it up and go.
                

			
        
    
	
        
            Basketball court?
        
        
			
				Possibility 1
				Possibility 2
			
			
            	Yes. We&#39;re going to have a farewell party at the Basketball Club.
 We&#39;ll celebrate our upperclassmen&#39;s graduation and have fun with sweets and stuff.
 It almost doesn&#39;t feel real that they&#39;re graduating, though…
                

			
			
            	Yeah… I get why we&#39;re here, &#39;cause we&#39;re the Basketball Club and all…
 But why do we have to play outside? We could&#39;ve done it inside, like the gym…
 Can I go home before anyone catches me…?
                

			
        
    

 2/3

Hello, Anzu-san. What&#39;re you doing here so early in the morning…?
Yes, I&#39;m helping my family with the store.
If you&#39;re looking for a particular shop, I can help you.


    
        
            I'm here to buy vegetables.
        
        
			
				Possibility 1
				Possibility 2
			
			
            	You&#39;ll cook some for lunch? Ahh, you&#39;ll cook food for you at the cafeteria…
 You make use of that in school, huh?
 Then I&#39;d be happy to help you find the seasonal vegetables, so please do ask me any time…♪
                    

			
			
            	…You want avocadoes? Yes, we have some.
       

              But avocado isn&#39;t a vegetable, actually. It&#39;s a fruit.
They&#39;re always next to the veggies, though, so people tend to confuse it for one.
                

			
        
    
	
        
            I'm on my way to the pharmacy to buy band-aids.
        
        
			
				Possibility 1
				Possibility 2
			
			
            	Ohh, you carry some in case anyone gets injured?
 …It&#39;s true that there can be a few small accidents when practicing a dance routine.
 Heheh… You&#39;re always prepared for anything, I&#39;m impressed…♪
                

			
			
            	…Huh? Are you injured somewhere?
 Um, it&#39;s not for you…? That&#39;s good, then…
 You can be absentminded sometimes, so I was worried for a second.
                

			
        
    

 3/3

Ah—! I&#39;m so sorry. I was thinking about something while walking, so I didn&#39;t notice you…
I saw something I shouldn&#39;t have seen…
I dunno what I&#39;m supposed to do in times like these… I wish I could just erase my memory of it entirely…


    
        
            What did you see?
        
        
			
				Possibility 1
				Possibility 2
			
			
            	Um, I saw someone crying, even though they&#39;re never the type to…
       

              …Huh? &quot;Oh, you saw me&quot;? I don&#39;t mean you, Anzu-san…?
Ahaha, you teared up a bit while yawning? That&#39;s a cute reason to cry…♪
                    

			
			
            	Ah, um… I don&#39;t think this is something I can tell others…
 I might&#39;ve just been imagining it anyway…
 

        …I&#39;d rather keep this for myself for now.

				Possibility 1
				Possibility 2
			
			
            	…Mm? Are you wondering if I had a nightmare?
 Please don&#39;t pat my head out of nowhere… You surprised me, y&#39;know?
 

        I don&#39;t dislike it, but it&#39;s kinda embarrassing, like I&#39;m a little kid…
                

			
			
            	Um… Why did you reach your hand out…?
 Whaa!? I might be able to forget if I get hit!?
 I-I don&#39;t wanna get hurt… Sometimes you think up terrifying things, Anzu-san…

 1/3

You and Sengoku-kun were way too panicked…
You just ran off out of nowhere.

And then even brought over some troublesome people…


    
        
            I'm sorry…
        
        
			
				Possibility 1
				Possibility 2
			
			
            	Ah— I&#39;m sorry… I went too far.
 I can&#39;t believe I said that when you&#39;re just so worried for me…
 I&#39;m so depressed, I wanna die…
                    

			
			
            	Ah— Um… Please don&#39;t worry about it, Anzu-san.
 I know both of you were just worried for me, and that&#39;s why you went and called for them…
 I&#39;m so sorry for making you worry.
                

			
        
    
	
        
            Were we a nuisance?
        
        
			
				Possibility 1
				Possibility 2
			
			
            	I feel frustrated that everyone saw such a miserable side of me…
       

              But well, thanks to that, I got to say what I wanted to tell everyone and get it out of my system…
I dunno if that&#39;s a good thing or bad thing, though…
                

			
			
            	I feel like I just had to face this head on no matter what this time around, but…
 I really don&#39;t ever wanna go through this again.
 

        So I&#39;m glad everyone came over.
                

			
        
    

 2/3

Everyone is working hard in preparation for Repayment Festival, huh…
All for the sake of conveying their gratitude through their performance…
Ahh, please don&#39;t worry about me.


    
        
            Let's do our best together.
        
        
			
				Possibility 1
				Possibility 2
			
			
            	Yeah, about that…
 I plan to just support them as a fan this time.
 I&#39;m so envious of you, Anzu-san. You&#39;re always full of motivation.
                    

			
			
            	It&#39;s too late by now…
 I&#39;m sure they&#39;re both sick of me at this point, anyway.
 I&#39;ll just support them from the sidelines. I&#39;m cheering you on too, Anzu-san.
                

			
        
    
	
        
            Will you do something from now?
        
        
			
				Possibility 1
				Possibility 2
			
			
            	I&#39;m gonna go back home now, but why do you ask…?
 You&#39;d like me to peek at a Ryuseitai practice session with you…?
 

        …How on earth do you expect me to see those two after everything…?
                

			
			
            	Yes, I have to help my family after this.
 Everyone in the shopping district is preparing their stalls for the day of Repayment Festival.
 I&#39;m used to it by now, but it&#39;s always a lot of work…
                

			
        
    

 3/3

Our seniors really will graduate, won&#39;t they…
A lot has happened the past year…

But the reason we were able to remain as the five of us is also thanks to you, Anzu-san.


    
        
            Thank you.
        
        
			
				Possibility 1
				Possibility 2
			
			
            	Whaa, that&#39;s what made you cry…!?
       

              I don&#39;t want to see anyone&#39;s tears ever again.
So please smile, Anzu-san…♪
                    

			
			
            	No, no, I&#39;m the one who&#39;s grateful.
 So please don&#39;t bow your head, Anzu-san…!
 Let&#39;s continue to support each other from now on, okay?
                

			
        
    
	
        
            It's because of everyone's bonds!
        
        
			
				Possibility 1
				Possibility 2
			
			
            	Bonds…?
 That makes me feel a bit embarrassed somehow.
 But I got to confirm to myself that I really do love everyone in Ryuseitai…♪
                

			
			
            	Of course! They&#39;re my comrades who fought alongside me for a whole year, after all!
       

              —I bet that&#39;s what Morisawa-senpai would say…
Something must be wrong with me if I really imitated him of all people…

 1/3

Anzu-dono~ Good morning~☆
Mm, I&#39;m helping Isara-dono with Student Council work.
I&#39;d do whatever I can for Isara-dono&#39;s sake! ♪


    
        
            Shall I help you?
        
        
			
				Possibility 1
				Possibility 2
			
			
            	I&#39;m happy you&#39;d like to help, but…!
 I must work hard on my own, for the sake of maintaining the Ninja Association…!
 So please do watch over me for now.
                    

			
			
            	R-Really? I&#39;d love that!
 To be honest, I was not sure if I could accomplish this task on my own…
 It&#39;d be reassuring to have you around, Anzu-dono~♪
                

			
        
    
	
        
            Sounds like a lot of work.
        
        
			
				Possibility 1
				Possibility 2
			
			
            	Sigh… Actually, my task is to search for someone, but I cannot find them.
 …Huh? They&#39;re taking a break today? That&#39;s why I could not find them, huh?
 My research was insufficient~ I failed as a ninja~!
                

			
			
            	Not at all. There&#39;s nothing I cannot accomplish! ♪
 I cannot keep depending on you for everything, Anzu-dono.
 So if there&#39;s anything you need help with, please rely on me!
                

			
        
    

 2/3

There hasn&#39;t been any Ryuseitai activities lately, so I haven&#39;t been seeing Tetora-kun and Midori-kun as much…
Our classes are different too, so at most, we just phone call or spot each other on the corridors.
Are they both coming to school every day…?


    
        
            How about you check Class A?
        
        
			
				Possibility 1
				Possibility 2
			
			
            	Mmm… I&#39;ve been avoiding doing so as my reason to see them is far too trivial, so I would only bother them…
 But I don&#39;t want to be incapable of talking to them ever again…!
 I&#39;ll try to go visit them now~♪
                    

			
			
            	I&#39;m very shy, but I did try to build up the courage to visit them the other day.
 But neither were there…! I wasted my effort…
 Anzu-dono~! A-Are they avoiding me~!?
                

			
        
    
	
        
            Actually…
        
        
			
				Possibility 1
				Possibility 2
			
			
            	Hmm, you&#39;re looking for them, too?
 If you&#39;d like, how about we search for them together?
 I wish to speak to them, too~♪
                

			
			
            	So they really haven&#39;t been showing up in school!? I wonder what happened…
 Huh? That was a lie?
 I was seriously worried, you know~! Please don&#39;t tease me like that~!
                

			
        
    

 3/3

Hmm~ I&#39;m wondering what to give my classmates for White Day…
I&#39;d like to prepare something before the day comes…
Anzu-dono! Please help me think of something~!


    
        
            I'm sure anything would make them happy!
        
        
			
				Possibility 1
				Possibility 2
			
			
            	As long as I&#39;m sincere about it?
 Y-You&#39;re right! I don&#39;t have to overthink it.
 Thank you so much for your advice, Anzu-dono…♪
                    

			
			
            	Hmm, would something practical work…?
 But I want to be sure I give them something that&#39;ll make them happy…
 U-Uuu~…? I won&#39;t be able to decide like this~!
                

			
        
    
	
        
            Maybe sweets?
        
        
			
				Possibility 1
				Possibility 2
			
			
            	Oh yes, Yuuta-kun gave me cookies.
 Hm? Cookies mean &quot;you&#39;re my friend&quot;?
 

        I-I&#39;m so happy! Yuuta-kun is a precious friend to me, too~♪
                

			
			
            	Since it&#39;s White Day, perhaps marshmallows…?
 Huh!? Marshmallows means &quot;I hate you&quot;!?
 E-Even if it&#39;s just a rumor, I can&#39;t risk giving something like that~!

 1/3

Personally, I want to participate in Repayment Festival, no matter what…
I want to reassure Taichou-dono and Shinkai-dono before they graduate.
I want to show them we&#39;ve grown so that they can graduate without any fear…!


    
        
            Let's do our best.
        
        
			
				Possibility 1
				Possibility 2
			
			
            	You also believe we will be fine…? ♪
 Exactly! We haven&#39;t been active in Ryuseitai just for show.
 We shall get through this together, even without Taichou-dono&#39;s help!
                    

			
			
            	Will we really be able to participate…?
 No, I mustn&#39;t lose heart. In the worst case, I shall participate all on my own, if nothing else.
 …Nay, I much rather participate with all three of us~!
                

			
        
    
	
        
            I wonder how it'll go…
        
        
			
				Possibility 1
				Possibility 2
			
			
            	Mm… I assume Tetora-kun and Midori-kun feel the same.
 But it feels like neither know how to bring the topic up, and that is why things have been awkward.
 I have to be the one to bring the topic up…!
                

			
			
            	…P-Please just say that it&#39;ll be okay!
 A producer mustn&#39;t say something so concerning~!
 We will participate! Our feelings are one and the same…!
                

			
        
    

 2/3

On that day, I tried to catch up to my seniors as soon as possible, but I failed to…
It really reminded me just how little stamina I have.
I was trying my best to build my stamina up, but it appears that it wasn&#39;t enough!


    
        
            Hmmm…
        
        
			
				Possibility 1
				Possibility 2
			
			
            	I have the impression that you&#39;re growing a lot due to how producing works…
 Hmm, I shall learn from you and move around much more!
 Having stamina is fundamental as an idol, too~♪
                    

			
			
            	My seniors were simply just too fast…?
 I suppose you are correct…
 But in that case, I would like to work hard so that I do not fall behind them.
                

			
        
    
	
        
            You're doing fine.
        
        
			
				Possibility 1
				Possibility 2
			
			
            	You believe that I&#39;ve built more stamina?
 I&#39;m so happy to hear that from you, the producer…♪
 Then I shall do my best to build up some more!
                

			
			
            	Huh!? It is alright because I&#39;m still young…?
 We are only a year apart, you know?
 Please don&#39;t act much more mature than me, like Tetora-kun did~! Don&#39;t leave me behind~!
                

			
        
    

 3/3

I was worried what would happen for a while, but it seems like we will be able to get through today~♪
Tetora-kun does not seem to be in top-shape, so I am a little concerned about him…
But I shall make sure that I accomplish my duty as part of Ryuseitai…!


    
        
            You really are the Yellow of a sentai squad.
        
        
			
				Possibility 1
				Possibility 2
			
			
            	Do you think so, Anzu-dono? I&#39;m so happy!
 The yellow color in sentai squads is the one who livens the mood~♪
 I shall do my utmost best to be that for Ryuseitai…!
                    

			
			
            	I am Ryusei Yellow, after all!
 I am doing my best to be the positive character at all times!
 However, perhaps I should be much more sensitive and sentimental this time…?
                

			
        
    
	
        
            How exciting!
        
        
			
				Possibility 1
				Possibility 2
			
			
            	Heh! Of course!
 If we don&#39;t enjoy ourselves, neither will our fans.
 Even if our members have decreased, we shall show them what Ryuseitai is all about!
                

			
			
            	W-What&#39;s the matter, Anzu-dono?
 You have such a suspicious-looking grin on your face!
 First the seniors, and now you — What is everyone scheming~!?

 1/3

&#39;Sup, Anzu-Anego! ☆ Thanks for all your help in the Dragon King Competition!
Thanks to you, I got to express every bit of my feelings to Taishou!

Next up is Repayment Festival…? Oh yeah…


    
        
          Things just keep getting hectic, huh?
        
        
			
				Possibility 1
				Possibility 2
			
			
          	You&#39;re helping around the place for Repayment Festival, huh? Thanks for all your hard work, Anzu-Anego!
 You had to do so much back in Chocolat Fes for us, like how to make chocolate and stuff…
 Please don&#39;t overwork yourself too much, or you&#39;ll hurt yourself.
                    

			
			
          	Repayment Festival is centered around us underclassmen, right?
 I may be the next commander of Ryuseitai, but I can&#39;t decide on things with my opinion alone.
 Please give me more time to see if we&#39;ll participate or not.
                

			
        
    
	
        
          What's wrong?
        
        
			
				Possibility 1

          	Ah, it&#39;s nothin&#39;! I was just thinking…
 That being said, I don&#39;t think I can tell you what we&#39;ll do for Repayment Festival yet.
 But once the time comes, I&#39;ll talk to you &#39;bout it!
                

			
			
          	…S-Sorry! I gave you a vague response!
 Ah nah, I was just thinking about what&#39;ll happen to Ryuseitai after our seniors graduate.
 I&#39;m pretty anxious more than anything right now…
                

			
        
    

 2/3

Ossu! Thank you for coming over to the dojo!
But Taishou isn&#39;t here right now. He&#39;s busy dealing with somethin&#39; in his unit.

But if I&#39;m to be honest, I wish we could&#39;ve trained a bit longer before he graduates…


    
        
          Shall I be your partner?
        
        
			
				Possibility 1
				Possibility 2
			
			
          	Like, a sparring partner!?
  Ah, not that? You meant as someone to talk to?
  Sure, I&#39;d love to get some advice from ya~♪
                    

			
			
          	Whaa!? You&#39;ll be my sparring partner…!?
  You aren&#39;t a martial artist, and I could never throw a punch at a lady…
  Taishou&#39;ll get mad at me if I ever did.
                

			
        
    
	
        
          I think you're pretty strong already.
        
        
			
				Possibility 1
				Possibility 2
			
			
          	It&#39;s &#39;cuz I&#39;ve been training as much as I can so I can be on par with Taishou.
  I think I was able to show him I&#39;ve grown lots in the Dragon King Competition.
  It&#39;s all thanks to Taishou and my seniors in Ryuseitai that I&#39;ve grown this much…♪
                

			
			
          	You know how strong Taishou is, right, Anzu-Anego?
  I&#39;m still nowhere near that point, not even on the same footing as him!
  So I&#39;m gonna grow stronger and stronger!
                

			
        
    

 3/3

…Hm? Why&#39;re you staring at me? Is there somethin&#39; on my face?
I seem more mature? Even you&#39;re saying that, Anzu-Anego?
Seng—Shinobu-kun also said something like that to me. Did I really change that much~?


    
        
          Shinobu-kun?
        
        
			
				Possibility 1
				Possibility 2
			
			
        Yeah, as in Sengoku-kun! I&#39;ve decided to start calling him by his first name.
I didn&#39;t know what timing would be right to change how I called him at first.
  

        But now that I&#39;m calling him that… It&#39;s a li&#39;l embarrassing somehow…♪
  

			
			
        It really is weird when I call him that, isn&#39;t it!?
Ahh, you&#39;re not used to me calling him by his first name, so you just wanted to be sure if you were hearing right.
Yeah, it still feels a li&#39;l off for me, too.

			
        
    
	
        
          …Yeah, somehow.
        
        
			
				Possibility 1
				Possibility 2
			
			
        Ahaha, just somehow…?
But I&#39;m happy for the compliment!
Even if you&#39;re just flattering me, I&#39;m still thankful!
                

			
			
      S-Somehow…!?
But to be honest, I don&#39;t think anything has changed about me.
I just wanted to stop being so spoiled from now on.

 1/3

I went too far the other day… I need to reflect on myself…
Woah!? Why&#39;d you suddenly pat my head!?
Ah, you thought I was depressed? Don&#39;t worry &#39;bout me.


    
        
            I felt like patting you.
        
        
			
				Possibility 1
				Possibility 2
			
			
            	I-I&#39;m not a kid…!
 Getting pat on the head doesn&#39;t make me happy, y&#39;know?
 …But you&#39;re worried for me, aren&#39;tcha? I&#39;m happy you feel that way…
                    

			
			
            	You thought I was crying?
 It&#39;s true that I&#39;m a li&#39;l worried, but…
 Don&#39;t worry, I&#39;m not that frail.
                

			
        
    
	
        
            I can't help but worry.
        
        
			
				Possibility 1
				Possibility 2
			
			
            	I&#39;m fine, really! Please don&#39;t worry about me!
 I&#39;m sorry for making you worry.
 You really are such a kind person, Anzu-Anego…♪
                

			
			
            	I ended up making so many people worry this time…
 I&#39;m real sorry for all the trouble…
 I&#39;m gonna go apologize to my seniors later today, too.
                

			
        
    

 2/3

We&#39;re gonna get to perform in the auditorium for Repayment Festival!
This is all thanks to our efforts in Chocolat Fes, and our fans!
I&#39;d love you to come see us if you don&#39;t mind, Anzu-Anego!


    
        
            I'm busy with work…
        
        
			
				Possibility 1
				Possibility 2
			
			
            	Y-You don&#39;t have to apologize!
 &#39;Course you&#39;re gonna be busy with produce work, it only makes sense.
 Let&#39;s both do our best for our own jobs!
                    

			
			
            	Mm? You might not be able to come cheer us on?
 Ahh, you&#39;ve been busy with managing the event and preparing stuff, huh?
 That&#39;s a shame. But if you ever get the time, please come watch us, even if for only a li&#39;l while.
                

			
        
    
	
        
            I'll definitely come!
        
        
			
				Possibility 1
				Possibility 2
			
			
            	Really!? You&#39;re awesome, Anego!
 Now I gotta be sure to put an effort in the performance!
 &#39;Cuz your cheers give us strength! ☆
                

			
			
            	Ah, you don&#39;t have to stress yourself out over it!
 I&#39;m sure we&#39;ll be able to get through the whole event as long as we don&#39;t make any major mistake.
 So you&#39;re free to come watch us in the second half, even if only a li&#39;l bit~♪
                

			
        
    

 3/3

I&#39;m super indebted to Shinkai-senpai and Taichou!
I may not be able to become like Taichou, but…
I&#39;m gonna do my best in my own way, alongside Midori-kun and Shinobu-kun…!


    
        
            Ryusei Red!
        
        
			
				Possibility 1
				Possibility 2
			
			
            	Y-You&#39;re gonna make me blush, y&#39;know…
 But I&#39;m gonna inherit Red after Taichou graduates.
 The leading role still suits Morisawa-senpai for now…!
                    

			
			
            	Whaaa!? You surprised me with that name!
 But I&#39;ve gotten a real taste of how much work it is to be &quot;Taichou&quot; this time around…
 I&#39;m gonna work as hard as I can as the next commander in line.
                

			
        
    
	
        
            Ryusei Black!
        
        
			
				Possibility 1
				Possibility 2
			
			
        Hm? Do I dislike being called that?
I&#39;ve been calling myself that for a whole year, so…

        &quot;Ryusei Black&quot; feels more right for me right now, to be honest.
                

			
			
            	Ah, there&#39;s no need to make that &quot;Ah, I messed up!&quot; look, y&#39;know?

              I&#39;m fine being Ryusei Black for now.
I&#39;m gonna do my very best until I can proudly call myself &quot;Ryusei Red&quot;!

 1/3

(Sigh… I&#39;ve had to deliver so many veggies today…)
(This is way too much for one person to carry… Actually, haven&#39;t they been asking for more than usual lately? No wonder it&#39;s been so rough…)
…Alright, I didn&#39;t forget to deliver anything here. Thank you for purchasing~… Wait, there isn&#39;t even anyone here…


    
        
            I'm here!
        
        
			
				Possibility 1
				Possibility 2
			
			
            	Woah!? Anzu-san…!?
Umm, could you please greet me first…? You scared the life out of me…
Ah, you don&#39;t have to apologize. I&#39;m also pretty silly for assuming nobody would be here… Let&#39;s just call it even…
                    

			
			
            	Woah, if you were here all along, then please say so… Don&#39;t tell me you heard me talking to myself… So embarrassing…
I was just finishing up my veggie deliveries from my family&#39;s greengrocer. What about you, Anzu-san? Are you working right now?
Huh, so you&#39;ve got a meeting to prepare for. That sounds rough to deal with early in the morning…
                

			
        
    
	
        
            Good morning.
        
        
			
				Possibility 1
				Possibility 2
			
			
            	Good morni—Oh, it&#39;s you, Anzu-san.
It&#39;s too early to eat here, y&#39;know…? I doubt there&#39;s anything prepared right now.
But I guess you could at least have a coffee here or something, yeah. The tables are big enough for sorting through documents, too.
                

			
			
            	Oh, that voice sounds familiar… Ahh, so it really was you, Anzu-san. Good morning.
As you can probably tell, I&#39;ve been going around ES delivering veggies. It takes so long to get through &#39;cause of how huge the load is…
&quot;You&#39;re doing a great job&quot;…? I could say the same thing to you, though…? It&#39;s incredible that you&#39;re here so early in the morning…
                

			
        
    

 2/3

Huh…? You&#39;re wondering why I keep sighing over and over again…?
Uuu… I&#39;m sorry, it must&#39;ve been so annoying… But I feel like I can&#39;t get through the day without sighing a little…
You probably already know this, but Ryuseitai hasn&#39;t been doing well lately…


    
        
            It's making you depressed, isn't it?
        
        
			
				Possibility 1
				Possibility 2
			
			
            	Yeah, exactly. I keep finding myself complaining about how depressing it is…
That side of me just frustrates me even more… But I can&#39;t hold in the urge to complain whenever I get fed up of something…
So I&#39;ve been at least trying to avoid making any depressing comments whenever I&#39;m around strangers…
                    

			
			
            	The three of us in Ryuseitai are on hiatus right now… and now that I&#39;ve got nothing to do, I end up overthinking stuff and getting even more depressed…
I&#39;ve been trying to at least do some kinda physical activity to avoid that, so that&#39;s why I&#39;ve been putting way more effort into my family&#39;s greengrocer than I used to.
Ah, wait a sec—Maybe another reason I&#39;ve been sighing so much is &#39;cause I&#39;ve been carrying a lot of veggies…?
                

			
        
    
	
        
            I've heard about it.
        
        
			
				Possibility 1
				Possibility 2
			
			
            	I knew it. Well, of course you would, since you&#39;re the producer…
We were just about to suck it up and do the whole restructuring of the unit when our seniors suddenly decided they&#39;d leave the unit… So things got even more complicated…
They&#39;re always so random with their decisions. I wish they&#39;d understand that you need to explain yourself first before deciding on something.
                

			
			
            	Mmm… Personally, I don&#39;t feel that affected by the whole restructuring thing the agency suggested…
Meanwhile, both Tetora-kun and Shinobu-kun were doing their best to accept the reality of the situation, but… our seniors made everything worse, you could say…
Thanks to that, Tetora-kun seems on edge, and our seniors haven&#39;t explained themselves yet either, as always. Sigh, this is so depressing…
                

			
        
    

 3/3

Thanks for lending an ear, Anzu-san…
Talking to you made me realize that maybe I really did want someone to hear me out all along…
I didn&#39;t think I needed it at first, &#39;cause I don&#39;t want too many people knowing what&#39;s been going on with us, and I barely have anyone I can talk to when it comes to unit problems…


    
        
            You can always count on me.
        
        
			
				Possibility 1
				Possibility 2
			
			
            	Ummm, no, it&#39;s okay… I feel too awkward to do that…
I&#39;d feel awful if I put more work on somebody who&#39;s already so busy…
Aren&#39;t you the one who could use a lending hand? I could help you out with stuff if it requires manual labor, so please feel free to ask me anytime.
                    

			
			
            	Isn&#39;t that attitude of yours why you&#39;re working so early…?
Here, please take some vegetables as repayment for hearing me out. It&#39;s my way of showing support, so… Please take care with your work.
Don&#39;t worry, these aren&#39;t for delivery. Hmm, mini tomatoes should be a nice snack when you&#39;re on the clock…
                

			
        
    
	
        
            Somebody to vent to, huh…
        
        
			
				Possibility 1
				Possibility 2
			
			
            	&quot;How about talking to a friend&quot;…? F-Friend…?
The first people that came to mind are Tetora-kun and Shinobu-kun, but that&#39;d just be a discussion between Ryuseitai members…
I guess Hinata-kun could be another option…? But I might end up bothering him if I suddenly came to him with a problem…
                

			
			
            	Whaa…? Talk to my roommates?
There&#39;s no way I could talk about my worries to the people who literally act as the vice-president of their agencies…
Ah, but dorming with my roommates is pretty normal for the most part… They gift me souvenirs whenever they travel around the country, and check over my school work, and stuff…

 1/3

(Let&#39;s search for… &quot;Morisawa, Chiaki&quot;…)
(Huh, there really are a lot of people talking about his casting role in the new tokusatsu show… Where the heck did they get this info from, anyway…?)
…Huh, Anzu-san? Good afternoon…


    
        
            What were you looking at on your phone?
        
        
			
				Possibility 1
				Possibility 2
			
			
            	Eh, nothing much… I was just thinking about how I can&#39;t seem to keep up with things lately…
I was looking through social media just now, and people are already talking about upcoming shows for winter and spring… When it&#39;s not even October yet…
I get so depressed whenever I come across stuff like that… But I guess it&#39;s my own fault for looking up stuff on social media in the first place…
                    

			
			
            	Huh? Nothing much… I was just searching up topics related to Morisawa-senpai on social media…
I&#39;d hate to find out that he&#39;s been talking behind our backs, so I regularly search his name as a check-up.
…Why&#39;re you asking me if I&#39;m okay…? What&#39;s so strange about looking up stuff about your senior online…?
                

			
        
    
	
        
            You had a scary look on your face while you were on your phone.
        
        
			
				Possibility 1

            	Oh, you should blame Morisawa-senpai for that. I was just searching up his name on social media…
I tend to search his name every once in a while, but I&#39;ve been doing it way more often lately &#39;cause I&#39;m frustrated that he&#39;s barely concerned about us nowadays…
Thanks to that, I have all his talk shows memorized in my head… Ugh, this sucks, I&#39;m not even a fan of him or anything…
                

			
			
            	Huh? Did I…?
Tetora-kun&#39;s told me before that I look scary when I&#39;m serious, but I can&#39;t exactly tell on my own…
That&#39;s why I&#39;m glad you pointed it out to me right now, Anzu-san. After all, I shouldn&#39;t have a scary look on my face when I&#39;m supposed to be a hero, right?
                

			
        
    

 2/3

What am I doing? …Not much. I&#39;ve got nothing to do right now…
Ryuseitai&#39;s on a hiatus, so I was planning to laze around at home after classes were over, but my parents kicked me out…
I&#39;d only stand out if I stuck around the shopping district, though, so… That&#39;s how I ended up here.


    
        
            What about your practice sessions?
        
        
			
				Possibility 1
				Possibility 2
			
			
            	I don&#39;t have any. I feel too awkward practicing all alone in an ES practice room…
Also, there&#39;d be no point to it, anyway. I wouldn&#39;t be able to tell how well I&#39;m doing with my choreography on my own…
Our formation and how we present ourselves together is really important, y&#39;know… I wouldn&#39;t be able to tell if I&#39;m doing that properly or not at all…
                    

			
			
            	I don&#39;t really have any. The only thing I could do now is solo practice, I think…?
I don&#39;t have any personal training like Tetora-kun and Shinobu-kun, either. Wait, woops—Almost forgot about Basketball Club…
Isara-senpai&#39;s been telling me to show up whenever I can, so maybe I&#39;ll consider going tomorrow…
                

			
        
    
	
        
            What about your solo work?
        
        
			
				Possibility 1
				Possibility 2
			
			
            	I do get jobs related to my greengrocer background…
But I can&#39;t have people think of me as the greengrocer boy over being an idol or hero, so I only do it every once in a while…
My parents are super happy about it, though, so lately I&#39;ve been trying to think of it as a way to repay them for everything.
                

			
			
            	Well, I guess I do have some, yeah… But I don&#39;t do my modeling work as often as I used to…
I don&#39;t have any photoshoots to deal with for the weekend anymore, so I&#39;ve just been casually enjoying my weekends lately…
And Ryuseitai&#39;s on hiatus too, so I guess I also get to chill on weekdays…
                

			
        
    

 3/3

…Ah, please check this out. This soft drink ad just showed up on my social media feed.
It&#39;s showing Morisawa-senpai in full… Oh, he&#39;s gotten a lot of comments from his fans, too.
Let&#39;s see… &quot;I&#39;m wishing you the best, Chiaki-kun&quot;… &quot;I love you, Chiaki-kun!&quot;… Man, he sure is popular…


    
        
            That's the point of the advertisement!
        
        
			
				Possibility 1
				Possibility 2
			
			
            	Ohhh, you&#39;re the one who suggested this to him?
I mean, I guess it does suit his image and all, but… since I know what he&#39;s actually like, I can&#39;t help but feel like everyone&#39;s being tricked…
We&#39;re talking about a guy who literally yells &quot;Okaa-saaaaaaaan!!!&quot; to the ocean, y&#39;know…?
                    

			
			
            	Point? …Ah, does that mean you&#39;re the one who suggested this ad to him?
Huh, it does kinda suit his image. I guess he does look like a pleasant person when he smiles—as long as he keeps his mouth shut, that is.
If only he always looked this calm in real life, and maybe then I&#39;d finally be able to live my life peacefully…
                

			
        
    
	
        
            Is something bothering you?
        
        
			
				Possibility 1
				Possibility 2
			
			
            	No, not really… It&#39;s just… He feels so far away…
He was always pestering me day in and out last year… So why is it so hard just to meet up with him now…? It makes no sense to me…
I should give him an earful or two the next time we meet, don&#39;t you think? Yeah, that sounds like a good idea…
                

			
			
            	I know there&#39;s no point in me getting angry at an ad, but I&#39;m kinda upset, like… &quot;What the hell are you smiling over when your unit&#39;s suffering right now&quot;…
He&#39;s supposed to be the number one person who wants to become a hero, but instead he asks to leave the unit? Does he ever bother to think about how we feel?
If you&#39;re such a hero of justice and all, then how about you consider protecting your own comrades&#39; feelings, huh…

 1/3

Producer! I&#39;m so glad I found you, I was looking for you!
T-The truth is… there was a box in front of my dorm room yesterday…
On it said &quot;to Morisawa-senpai&quot;, and… the name of that…


    
        
            That?
        
        
            Um, you know, the… Ugh! Find the courage within you, Morisawa Chiaki…!
Eggplants! I was gifted the most detested thing in the world: eggplaaaants~!
            

        
    
    
        
            Could it be…
        
        
            Y-Yeah… Exactly, I received eggplants…
I can only think of one person who&#39;d do this, but I didn&#39;t expect him to actually send me a box…
            

        
    
    
        
            You look pale…?
        
        
            Ahhh… I&#39;m sorry for worrying you…
I feel a chill down my spine all of a sudden, even though it&#39;s so hot outside…
            

        
    

 2/3
Somebody could trip if I left the box in the hallway, so I shoved it inside my dorm for the time being, but… I can&#39;t get the courage to open it.
I&#39;d honestly rather avoid seeing or touching it altogether, but…
It&#39;ll just rot if I leave it as it is…


    
        
            How about giving it to someone?
        
        
            Good idea… There&#39;s a couple of people who cook in the dorm&#39;s kitchen often, so maybe I could hand it to them, instead.
But that means carrying the box… Ughhh, so I can&#39;t avoid touching that, can I…
            

        
    
    
        
            That would be rude to the farmers, after all…
        
        
            Yeah, you&#39;re right… I shouldn&#39;t waste all the farmers&#39; effort in growing these.
I need to think up a way to get rid of them before they rot, or I&#39;ll feel bad…
            

        
    
    
        
            Do you hate eggplants that much?
        
        
            Of course I do…! I don&#39;t even want to hear its name! Don&#39;t you have something you hate that much, too!?
You don&#39;t? U-Umm… Okay then…
            

        
    

 3/3
Well, either way, thank you for hearing me out.
I&#39;ll do something about the box by today. I have to just see it this way: This is actually my lucky day!
Heroes grow stronger the more powerful the adversary! I&#39;ll make sure to overcome this obstacle, no matter what it takes!


    
        
          Someone else said the exact same thing…
        
        
            Ohh!? That&#39;s cool! They must be a fan of tokusatsu!
Who was it, exactly? I&#39;d love to talk to them all about tokusatsu…♪
            

        
    
    
        
            Shall I take a few from you?
        
        
            Y-Yeah, please…
I&#39;ll use wrapping paper and paper bags to avoid looking at them, and bring them over to you tomorrow.
            

        
    
    
        
            You can do this!
        
        
            Thank you! I&#39;d love to hear your cheers!
They&#39;ll give me strength! I&#39;ll use them to power up and win against the eggplants…!

 1/3

Ooh, this village really brings back a lot of memories for me. The last time I was here was for the Scroll of the Elements performance.
We still have time before the live show, so how about we go around the place for now?
Oh! There&#39;s a samurai walking about! It&#39;s like we&#39;ve been taken back to the era itself~♪


    
        
            It'd suit you.
        
        
            Ohh? I&#39;m so happy to hear that~♪
I think I&#39;d have fun acting as a samurai sheathing a katana, punishing the wicked and protecting the weak!
            

        
    
    
        
            I'm feeling nostalgic, too.
        
        
            I had a lot of fun going around the place during Scroll of the elements! Oh, and I remember how flashy Kanata&#39;s ninjutsu was.
The most exciting performance was when Sengoku jumped through a ring of fire. I remember the cheers like it was yesterday!          
            

        
    
    
        
            I hope the audience enjoys the performance.
        
        
            Yeah, me too. You prepared a lot for us today, after all!
We had to practice for this performance alongside the one for MDM, but we all worked hard for it, so I&#39;m sure it&#39;ll go well!
            

        
    

 2/3

Mhm! Does the outfit look okay like this, Producer!?
It&#39;s light and durable, and it even glows! It&#39;s fun to wear~♪
This surely must&#39;ve costed a lot of time and money to make… Did it?


    
        
            That's confidential information.
        
        
            Oh, were you told not to reveal the costs?
Hmm, that makes me a little worried, but I understand. I won&#39;t pry any further.
            

        
    
    
        
            I put a lot of effort into the katana prop's design, too.
        
        
            Oh yeah, I was wondering about that! Could I unsheathe it to try it out?
Ohhh! It has the same texture as one, too! This is so incredibly detailed—you wouldn&#39;t be able to tell on first glance!
            

        
    
    
        
            It'll be alright.
        
        
            Mmm, your &quot;alright&quot; doesn&#39;t always equate to that, though…
Don&#39;t overwork yourself, okay? Everyone, including me, would worry sick if you crashed down.
            

        
    

 3/3
Alright, the performance is starting soon. But before that, I&#39;d like to express my gratitude, Producer.
Thank you so much for doing everything in your power for Sengoku&#39;s sake. Sengoku tends to repress his emotions subconsciously, likely because the time when there was nobody who accepted him for his interests, but…
I can tell he&#39;s enjoying himself a lot right now. I&#39;m so glad you were here for him.


    
        
          It's all because everyone was here for him.
        
        
            Heheh, I&#39;m happy to hear you say that. Takamine, Nagumo, and Kanata all did their very best to make through the harsh practice—all for Sengoku&#39;s sake.
I&#39;m so glad everyone in Ryuseitai was here for him. I really, really am.
            

        
    
    
        
            I simply did my duty.
        
        
            Haha, your straightforward personality is your strength.
You were only a young girl when we first met, yet you&#39;ve already grown so much since then.
            

        
    
    
        
            It's all for the sake of the Ninja Association.
        
        
            Yeah, this performance is for the sake of the Ninja Association&#39;s survival!
Alright, I&#39;m off! I&#39;ll run and bounce all about on stage!

 1/3

Um… Let&#39;s get close slowly, and fling my net on the bug at the right moment… slooowly…
Crap, it ran away… I think I did it a bit too early…
Ah, good afternoon. I have my meeting with you today, right?


    
        
            Were you playing a game?
        
        
            Ah, yeah, I was. You get to decorate an island and craft stuff in this game. It&#39;s pretty fun.
Me and Harukawa-kun were gonna play together today, so I brought my console to school.
            

        
    
    
        
            Maybe I arrived too early…
        
        
            Hmm, have you…? Ermm, let&#39;s see, we have our meeting at the half hour mark, which is ten minutes from now.
Morisawa-senpai always says stuff like, &quot;It&#39;s only natural to be ten minutes early to a job as a working adult!&quot;, so I think you&#39;re right on time.
            

        
    
    
        
            I'm only going to pass on the documents.
        
        
            Oh, that&#39;s already a lifesaver. I&#39;m not gonna have enough time for another meeting &#39;cause of my solo work, so…
Um, so I have another modeling photoshoot to do, huh? I feel like I&#39;ve been getting those often lately…
            

        
    

 2/3
How about you also try playing this game, Anzu-san? There are other students playing it, too.
You can take your time progressing in the game, and you get to fish or dig around for stuff, and even make your own designs for stuff.
And what&#39;s more, all the characters are soft-looking and soothing to the eyes.


    
        
            Do mascots appear?
        
        
            Yeah, or well, they&#39;re called villagers in the game.
I get to have a nickname from them whenever I become good friends with one of them, which is kinda nice.
            

        
    
    
        
            Is there anything else you can do in it?
        
        
            Um, you can also grow your own flowers, or travel to other places.
You can even buy souvenirs on your travels, so I feel like I get to enjoy life itself through the game…♪
            

        
    
    
        
            Fishing is fun!
        
        
            It is, right? I tend to lose track of time whenever I fish.
Sigh… I just remembered the big catch I failed to get yesterday… Man, I could&#39;ve caught me a good one…
            

        
    

 3/3
Oh yeah, there was a game Tetora-kun recommended me to play with him…
Um, I think it&#39;s this one? Lemme download it…
Eep—! What&#39;s with this giant on the screen…? There&#39;s a few characters carrying a weapon in their hands, too… T-This is terrifying!


    
        
          This game's fun.
        
        
            Hm? Do you play this game, Anzu-san?
Huh, if you recommend playing it too, then I guess I&#39;ll give it a shot…
            

        
    
    
        
            Are you okay?
        
        
            I&#39;m sorry for surprising you… I&#39;m alright now.
Um, I think the tutorial started or something? I guess I&#39;ll just get through this first…
            

        
    
    
        
            It's a popular game, isn't it?
        
        
            Oh yeah, you reminded me that my stylist mentioned playing this game…
They said their favorite character is the one who takes photos, but I dunno which character that is.

 1/3

I&#39;m so sorry for making you help me with packing up the eggplants.
I&#39;m gonna send this box of eggplants to Morisawa-senpai.
I sent him this urgent message the other day, but he arrived late to our meeting anyway, so this is gonna be his punishment.


    
        
            "Eeeggy-eggy-eggplant…?"
        
        
            Yeah, it&#39;s as it says: eeeggy-eggy-eggyplant. It&#39;s Eggplant Baron, after all.
Oh, yeah—Could you draw me a picture of Eggplant Baron, Anzu-san? It&#39;d help boost my spirits.
            

        
    
    
        
            Would this really count as a punishment?
        
        
            Well, it&#39;d definitely work as one for Morisawa-senpai.
But I heard heroes grow stronger the more powerful the adversary, so maybe he&#39;ll tear up with joy over the opportunity.
            

        
    
    
        
            These are pretty good eggplants.
        
        
            Hehe, aren&#39;t they? I chose the absolute best we had in our greengrocer.
You can tell how fresh it is from the smooth and silky feel, and the green calyx is clearly in good shape~ I can guarantee its tastiness~♪
            

        
    

 2/3

Whew… I packed a lot inside, so it&#39;s heavier than expected…
I&#39;m sorry to ask this of you, but could you please press the button on the elevator for me? My hands are tied carrying this box.
I&#39;m gonna carry this over to Starmony Dorm, so I&#39;d like to go down to the lobby.


    
        
            Should I carry it for you, instead?
        
        
            No, please don&#39;t worry about it. I deliver this many vegetables all the time, so I&#39;m used to it.
Plus, I&#39;d get scolded if I make you of all people carry this for me…
            

        
    
    
        
            What if you placed it down for now?
        
        
            Hmm… But we&#39;ll reach the lobby pretty quickly, won&#39;t we…?
It&#39;s harder to carry it back up, so I&#39;d rather hold onto it all the way.
            

        
    
    
        
            I'll join you.
        
        
            Huh? Do you have something to do at the dorms?
Ohhh, you&#39;d like to greet Trickstar after they&#39;ve returned from their remote photoshoot? They must be really busy lately…
            

        
    

 3/3

Alright, we&#39;ll have to part ways here. Thank you for your hard work, Anzu-san.
I&#39;m gonna place this box in front of Morisawa-senpai&#39;s room. I&#39;m excited to see how he&#39;ll react…♪
Oh, and this eggplant is for you. It&#39;s my thanks for helping me out, so please take it.


    
        
          Thank you.
        
        
            Don&#39;t worry about it~♪ I can guarantee its quality, so please eat it while it&#39;s still fresh.
You&#39;d definitely enjoy them fried or in a vegetable stew. Oh, I also recommend mapo eggplant.
            

        
    
    
        
            Will this make him happy?
        
        
            Hmmm… I wrote &quot;Eggplants&quot; really big on the box, so… He&#39;ll likely jump the moment he sees the box, for starters.
He may not even try opening it… But, well, I&#39;ll see what I&#39;ll do when that happens.
            

        
    
    
        
            You two are close, huh?
        
        
            Huh? Do you mean me and Morisawa-senpai?
Whaaat, no way… How did you even reach that conclusion…?[1]

 1/3

&#39;Suuup, Anego~! This seat&#39;s free!
I&#39;m sorry for calling out for you all of a sudden. You looked like you were trynna find a seat, sooo…
Would you like to sit here for lunch?


    
        
            Are you okay with that?
        
        
            &#39;Course! You&#39;re free to sit here.
I was gonna eat lunch on my own today, so if anything, I feel super lucky that I get to eat with you!
            

        
    
    
        
            Thank you.
        
        
            Don&#39;tchu worry &#39;bout it! Did you bring your own lunchbox today?
I&#39;m having the kalbi meal! I&#39;m gonna gobble this all up and work hard on the rest of my classes~♪
            

        
    
    
        
            Where are the other two?
        
        
            Ahh, Midori-kun&#39;s got work, and Shinobu-kun has Student Council duties.
We usually eat in class when we can, but I&#39;m on my own today, so I came here to eat instead.
            

        
    

 2/3
Oh yeah, Midori-kun told me you play this game, too.
Ohh, you&#39;re super into it? Isn&#39;t it so fun~!? ♪
I get so into the game that I almost lose sleep over it.


    
        
            Sleep on time, okay?
        
        
            &#39;Course! I make sure I sleep before it&#39;s midnight.
Narukami-senpai&#39;s always warning me that lack of sleep is bad for my skin, so I always stop playing by the time I gotta sleep.
            

        
    
    
        
            Would you like to play together?
        
        
            That&#39;d be awesome! Let&#39;s play together after we eat!
We&#39;ll friend each other in-game. Couldja gimme your player ID, please?
            

        
    
    
        
            Which character do you like?
        
        
            Hmmm… It ain&#39;t my style to run away all the time, so I like playing characters that can fight.
What &#39;bout you, Anego? Ohhh~ It&#39;s just like you to use that type of character~♪
            

        
    

 3/3
Ah, the bell&#39;s gonna ring soon.
Ehehe, I never thought I&#39;d get to play with you, Anego!
We&#39;ll have to end it here for today, but I&#39;d love to play with you again sometime, if that&#39;s alright!


    
        
          Let's play it with everyone.
        
        
            You bet! I&#39;d love to play it with you, Shinobu-kun, and Midori-kun. How &#39;bout we play on our next lunch break?
Aight, I&#39;ll ask &#39;em if they&#39;re free. I&#39;ll let ya know if it&#39;s a yes!
            

        
    
    
        
            Okay, next time then.
        
        
            Ohhh!? You&#39;re up for another round, I see~♪ I wanna see if I can invite other people to play with us, then.
Hmmm… I think Sora-kun&#39;s playing it too, so maybe I&#39;ll try asking him?
            

        
    
    
        
            That was a lot of fun.
        
        
            You betcha, I really got into it~♪
Woah—! The bell rang. I gotta head to class quick! I&#39;ll see ya later, Anego!

 1/3

Uumyu… How the heck did our seniors understand what they needed to do through &quot;eggy-eggplant&quot; alone?
Maybe I&#39;m the weirdo here… I do need to keep my common sense in check at all times, to be fair…
No, no! It can&#39;t be me who&#39;s weird here~!


    
        
            What's wrong?
        
        
            Ah! Anego, great to see ya! I hope you&#39;re doing well.
Um, you saw me racking my brains? Ahaha, it&#39;s no big deal, please don&#39;t worry &#39;bout it.
            

        
    
    
        
            Um…
        
        
            Woah—! Please don&#39;t scare me like that, Anego…!
I can barely tell you&#39;re there when you stand behind me without making a sound… I&#39;m sorry for yelling.
            

        
    
    
        
            By eggy-eggplant, do you mean…
        
        
            Huh? You know &#39;bout it, Anego?
Midori-kun sent a fishy message to Morisawa-senpai, but he managed to understand it just fine, and I don&#39;t get how…
            

        
    

 2/3
Huh? You helped Midori-kun out with packing up eggplants in a box?
Ahaha, he seriously sent Morisawa-senpai eggplants? I thought that was a joke…
Ryuseitai was able to meet up together after so long, and we had a li&#39;l discussion &#39;bout eggplants.


    
        
            I wonder if he accepted those eggplants?
        
        
            I dunno… I haven&#39;t heard anything &#39;bout it.
Oh, wait, I do kinda remember hearing a scream yesterday… It vaguely sounded like Morisawa-senpai&#39;s voice…
            

        
    
    
        
            I received eggplants, too.
        
        
            Ohh, you made it into mapo eggplant? I bet spicy mapo would be great to have in this weather~♪
You won&#39;t feel the heat if you just gobble down some spicy food!
            

        
    
    
        
            What did you talk about?
        
        
            The main reason we gathered was to talk &#39;bout Shinobu-kun&#39;s worries.
Huh, you already know &#39;bout how the Ninja Association might disband? Ohh… So Shinobu-kun told you himself.
            

        
    

 3/3
But maaan, the Student Council must seriously be driven to a corner if they&#39;re actually planning to disband the Ninja Association…
Shinobu-kun worked sooo hard for his club all this time…
I know exactly how much heart and soul he put into it, so I wanna do whatever I can for him.


    
        
          This is reminding me of Scroll of the Elements.
        
        
            You&#39;re right! We performed with Akatsuki back then.
I remember when Kanzaki-senpai brought his horse, Saigoudon. That was a real surprise!
            

        
    
    
        
            Like when he got super excited about a ninja scroll…
        
        
            Oh yeaaah, something like that happened, right?
Midori-kun told me &#39;bout it. Shinobu-kun got super excited by the thought of finally finding a real ninja scroll, yeah?
            

        
    
    
        
            I remember he'd climb the walls often.
        
        
            Oh yeah, that was part of his training. He used to practice the Cloning Jutsu and the Invisibility Jutsu, too.
I think he used to do a Channeling Jutsu, too, but I don&#39;t really remember what he was trying to channel, exactly…? Do you remember, Anego?

 1/3

Oh, Anzu! You’ve been here even though it’s summer holidays! Good work! ☆
Hm, me? I’m about to head to the Handicraft Club.
He’s not here with me, but Kanata’s going there too.


    
        
            The lights were on until late at night.
        
        
			
				Possibility 1
				Possibility 2
			
			
            	Wait, that means you were here late at night, too.
Nope, you won’t get me with a simple “teehee♪”
I understand that you’re busy, but you have to also rest.
                    

			
			
            	I see… I’ll have to thank Itsuki and Kagehira-kun.
Hm? Ahh, Ryuseitai will be participating in the Shooting Star Festival, so I’ve asked Itsuki to make the outfits for us.
That’s probably why they’ve been working until really late.
                

			
        
    
	
        
            Why the Handicraft Club?
        
        
			
				Possibility 1
				Possibility 2
			
			
            	I’m about to go ask Valkyrie if they want to join us in Shooting Star Festival.
Hm? Ahh, it’s a local summer festival.
They keyword of the festival this year is “Shooting Star” (Ryusei), so it was a calling to us.
                

			
			
            	Hmmm… Where do I begin…
I’ll start from when we decided to participate in Shooting Star Festival.
The story might be long, so let me know if you’re in a hurry.
                

			
        
    

 2/3
Valkyrie will be joining with us in the Shooting Star Festival, I’m so happy ☆
Woah—Anzu!? You really have no presence, huh?
…What? “Then it’s my turn to shine”?


    
        
            I’ll help with making the outfits.
        
        
			
				Possibility 1
				Possibility 2
			
			
            	Outfits? Ahh, the ones for the Shooting Star Festival, right?
It is true that we’ll need outfits made for both Valkyrie and Ryuseitai.
I’m sure Itsuki wouldn’t mind if you asked him if there’s anything you can help with.
                    

			
			
            	I’m guessing you mean the Shooting Star Festival outfits.
You’re already working on the Quarrel Festival outfits, and I don’t find it admirable to be doing work all over the place, y&#39;know?
                

			
        
    
	
        
            I’m happy that my work is increasing.
        
        
			
				Possibility 1
				Possibility 2
			
			
            	It’d be a waste to work throughout all of your summer holiday, y’know?
Hm? To you, working during summer is a valuable way to spend your time?
Mmm… You really surprise me with how much of a hard worker you are, Anzu.
                

			
			
            	I see, I see. You really like to work, huh… ☆
Mhm, it’s good to have things you like.
As for me, I love heroes! ♪
                

			
        
    

 3/3
Ooh! This croissant’s so tasty!
Hmm? It isn’t good to eat while walking, you say?
That’s true. It’s exactly as you say!


    
        
            It smells tasty.
        
        
			
				Possibility 1
				Possibility 2
			
			
            	Anzu, are you drooling?
Ahaha, you’re probably the type that puts food before romance, huh.
I got a lot of them as a gift, so you should eat, too! ☆
                    

			
			
            	Ahaha, you don’t have to get so close to it.
Here, this is for you. It’s okay, go ahead and eat it.
Eating with someone else makes it all the tastier~♪
                

			
        
    
	
        
            Are you hungry?
        
        
			
				Possibility 1
				Possibility 2
			
			
            	Ah, no, I’m—…Hm?
Did you just hear a growling sound?
It sounded like it came from someone’s stomach, but it isn’t me… Hmmm, that’s weird…
                

			
			
            	Ah, I’m not really that hungry, but…
I smelled croissants, and immediately felt like eating some.
Would you like to eat one, too?

 1/3

Mhm, mhm. I&#39;m glad we were able to safely find the little girl&#39;s mother.
It&#39;s thanks to you and Nagumo. Thank you.
Now you too can become a splendid hero alongside us~♪


    
        
            I’ll be the one to protect the world’s peace!
        
        
			
				Possibility 1
				Possibility 2
			
			
            	Oh, that sounds really good!
You’re getting really into it after being told you’re a hero, you little~♪
Alright, let’s both say it together! I’ll be the one to protect the world’s peace…☆
                    

			
			
            	Hrmm, I didn’t expect a rival to appear all of a sudden!
Well, both you and I have the same goal, though.
So let’s go hand-in-hand and protect the world&#39;s peace together…☆
                

			
        
    
	
        
            You're the hero, Senpai.
        
        
			
				Possibility 1
				Possibility 2
			
			
            	Thank you, Anzu. I’m happy to hear you say that about me.
…Oh?
I spotted young boy who looks lost! We part ways now, farewell!
                

			
			
            	You don&#39;t have to be modest.
It&#39;s me who decided you&#39;re a hero. So hold your head high.
…Though, even I still have ways to go until I become a hero~♪
                

			
        
    

 2/3
We have some time until the Shooting Star Festival starts.
Alright, let’s have a light snack until then. What do you want to eat?
You’ll find the street food over there, and sweet food in the opposite direction.


    
        
            Street food.
        
        
			
				Possibility 1
				Possibility 2
			
			
            	Then you want okonomiyaki or takoyaki or something, right?
It’s pretty heavy stuff, so could you stick to buying only one?
And whatever you can’t eat, I’ll eat it for you~♪
                    

			
			
            	I know how you feel, I also just have to eat street food when I’m at festivals!
Every stall that’s selling it looks really good, and I can’t help but eat it all.
But this time we have a live show, so I’ll keep it small!
                

			
        
    
	
        
            Sweet food.
        
        
			
				Possibility 1
				Possibility 2
			
			
            	Okay, then we’ve got crêpe, cotton candy, chocolate bananas, apple candy… The list goes on.
For now, let’s go around the stalls and eat whatever we feel like eating~♪
                

			
			
            	Sweet food, huh? Oh, there’s a crêpe stall over there!
I’ll take the usual chocolate banana flavor.
You’ll take tuna? That’s more like a side dish than something sweet.
                

			
        
    

 3/3

Ta~maya~!
You say it with me too, Anzu! Ta~maya~!
Yes, yes! This is what you just have to do when you&#39;re watching fireworks! ☆


    
        
            Let’s watch the fireworks quietly.
        
        
			
				Possibility 1
				Possibility 2
			
			
            	Sorry! I couldn’t hear you from how loud the fireworks are. Say that again please!
Quietly watch…? Ah, so be quiet, basically.
True. I’ll enjoy the fireworks quietly…☆
                    

			
			
            	It’s fireworks, so doing this would ruin the atmosphere?
I don’t really get it, but that’s how you can see it, huh.
I’m bad at staying quiet, but I’ll do what I can!
                

			
        
    
	
        
            Other people here are doing it now too, aren’t they?
        
        
			
				Possibility 1
				Possibility 2
			
			
            	Alright then, we have to raise our voices so we don’t lose to them!
Ta~maya~! Yes, just like that!
Let’s fire up those fireworks just like the Shooting Star Festival~♪
                

			
			
            	Oh, you’re right.
Wait, isn’t that Nagumo and the others?
Sengoku and Takamine are there too! Let’s go call out to them!

 1/3

Heheh, there’s Okinawa souvenirs here!
Oh, Sengoku, they have a handful of mascots. Which do you think would suit Takamine?
Since you’re the same age as him, I’d be happy to get your advice on which to get him!


    
        
            How about the Shisa statue?
        
        
            Oh, good choice! It&#39;s part of Okinawan culture, after all!
Thank you, Sengoku, it&#39;s perfect! And since it should work as an amulet as well, it&#39;s like two for the price of one!
            

        
    
    
        
            Over here are the deep-sea fish!
        
        
            Heheh, those would be a better gift for Kanata, wouldn&#39;t they?
Oh! How about I buy matching accessories for all five of us? That wouldn&#39;t be a bad idea, either~♪
            

        
    
    
        
            The bitter melon mascot would suit him perfectly!
        
        
            You’re right, Takamine would love a mascot souvenir based on a vegetable!
Hahaha, I&#39;m glad I asked you, Sengoku! Your ninja detection skills always come to great use…☆
            

        
    

 2/3

You can&#39;t have a ryokan trip without a pillow fight… I do want to agree with that, but—
Comet Show only happened a few weeks ago, so I feel like we should have a discussion with each other first.
With that being said, I&#39;d like to ask you something, Kanata. Where am I going wrong whenever we talk about it? I&#39;d like your help in understanding that.


    
        
            perhaps the Timing.
        
        
            Hm… so what I discussed earlier was also simply just the wrong timing?
But SS is an important event… We can&#39;t keep dancing around the topic, can we…?
            

        
    
    
        
            please read the Room.
        
        
            Oh… so that&#39;s why you suggested the pillow fight, huh…?
I keep talking about serious topics so much, that I&#39;m being seen as someone who can&#39;t read the r—… That&#39;s not what you meant?
            

        
    
    
        
            let's not Talk about that right now.
        
        
            Ah, even discussing it is dismissed… Working towards a solution really is too difficult right now after all, huh…
Alright, I&#39;ll try and figure out where I went wrong on my own for now! Sorry for taking up your time, Kanata.
            

        
    

 3/3

Oh yeah, where&#39;d Kanata go?
He tends to go to watersides at every opportunity, so maybe he&#39;s gone to bathe in the sea?
Nagumo, have you heard anything from Kanata? Or if you&#39;ve seen him head off to the beach, or something of the sort.


    
        
          I saw him in the open bathhouse.
        
        
            Oh, why didn&#39;t I think of that!
Thank you, Nagumo. You saved me the trouble of going to the beach!
            

        
    
    
        
            Nope…
        
        
            Oh, that&#39;s a shame… I was hoping we could all talk about our plan for Ryuseitai.
Oh well, we&#39;ll just have to work together and find him. Is that alright, Nagumo?
            

        
    
    
        
            He went to the beach.
        
        
            Heheh, so it was just as I imagined. I knew he&#39;d be drawn to Okinawa&#39;s sea.
Aaalright then, let&#39;s go find him! Could you call over the other two, Nagumo?

 1/3

I heard the Okinawan idols are powerhouses, yet Akatsuki managed to defeat them all with ease… Unbelievable.
It sounds a bit troubling somehow, but… on the bright side, no problems occurred so far.
Anyway, it&#39;s lunch time now! Takamine, make sure you should eat meat and fish too, not just vegetables~♪


    
        
            Sigh…
        
        
            Hm? Why’re you sighing? Are you low on nutrients due to a lack of meat!?
Listen, Takamine! Eating well will help regulate your mood! Don’t be picky with your food, okay?
            

        
    
    
        
            I know.
        
        
            Mhm, that’s good then! I guess I meddled a little too much.
We’re in Okinawa, y’know? I’d love to see you try a few of their fine cuisine~♪
            

        
    
    
        
            I ate already.
        
        
            Oh, it&#39;s good to know you&#39;ve finished eating, then! I had the wrong idea because of the few vegetables left on your plate.
You ate so much, Takamine! Wonderful! I&#39;ll eat just as much too in hopes of growing bigger! ☆

That all being said, it&#39;s surprising to see you complain about your concerns, Kiryu. I&#39;ve always had the impression of you being a bold and daring guy, ever since The War days—
Oh yeah, actually, while we&#39;re at it, can I ask? I&#39;d love to know how things have been going with Akatsuki lately.
I&#39;ve been having my own worries about Ryuseitai, so maybe I could get an idea of what to do through the way you guys operate.


    
        
            Same old for us.
        
        
            Heheh, that&#39;s wonderful!
You guys have been influencial since your days at Yumenosaki, after all! I bet you&#39;re doing great nowadays, too.
            

        
    
    
        
            It's rough at RythLink.
        
        
            Hmmm… You can&#39;t get any work opportunities due to the veteran units in the agency? That really does sound rough.
But you guys in Akatsuki aren&#39;t the type to get worn down by this either, Right? I know you&#39;ll do great~♪
            

        
    
    
        
            Is this really the time to talk about this?
        
        
            Sorry. Don&#39;t worry about it if it&#39;s too heavy. It&#39;s a bad habit of mine to stick my nose in other people&#39;s business.
But I just don&#39;t know what to do anymore about Ryuseitai… I&#39;ve just been stuck in a loop trying to figure it out on my own.
            

        
    

 3/3

(The Okinawan idols are asking for Ryuseitai&#39;s help.)
(Personally, I&#39;d like to go and help them, but I don&#39;t think the rest of my unit members agree with me, what with the current circumstances…)
(I have to do something, though. Maybe I should talk to someone about it…)


    
        
          (Maybe Kanata…?)
        
        
            …Yeah, I should talk to Kanata about all this — He&#39;s been by my side with Ryuseitai all this time.
I&#39;m counting on you, Ryusei Blue! Lend me your strength…!
            

        
    
    
        
            (I'll talk to Nagumo.)
        
        
            Mm, talking to Nagumo sounds like a good idea. I can talk to him as an equal, as he&#39;s also had Ryuseitai entrusted to him for a while.
But… I did something awful to him at Comet Show… I don&#39;t know if we&#39;ll be able to reach an agreement.
            

        
    
    
        
            (Someone outside of Ryuseitai…)
        
        
            …Yeah, there are far too many local idols in trouble right now — The issue is too large for only Ryuseitai to handle.
That means the only other people I could talk to are Akatsuki. I hope that they&#39;re willing to help out as fellow colleagues…

 1/3

Oh? Hello, Anzu! Are you on your way home after finishing work, too?
I also just finished up with my meeting about the show.
Mhm, this is perfect timing for both of us! How about we eat dinner together?


    
        
            What are you in the mood for?
        
        
            Hmm… Well, I had to film a scene for a drama, so I&#39;m starving!
If you&#39;re alright with it, I&#39;d love to eat something filling! French fries sounds really good right about now!
            

        
    
    
        
            Are you hungry?
        
        
            Yep! I had to film a scene for a drama, too, so I didn&#39;t get to have a proper lunch.
But don&#39;t worry, I haven&#39;t been overworking myself! I&#39;m doing great!
            

        
    
    
        
            Let's go!
        
        
            Ohh! That&#39;s the spirit! You&#39;re that hungry, huh?
Ahh… You also skipped on lunch… I know I&#39;m the last person to be saying this, but you shouldn&#39;t overwork yourself!
            

        
    

 2/3

They say hunger is the best sauce in the world, and they were right! Everything tastes super delicious when you&#39;re hungry!
I could count this as a reward for finishing up my work, even. You worked hard the whole day too, right?
Then please eat to your hearts content, to restore your energy for tomorrow!


    
        
            Of course!
        
        
            Mhm, that&#39;s the spirit! I&#39;ll also eat just as much to recharge myself for tomorrow.
As a hero, I have to ensure I can always rush over to anyone&#39;s call for help!
            

        
    
    
        
            You too, Morisawa-senpai.
        
        
            Of course! The reason we always have a tomorrow is to make it a better day than today!
For the sake of the world, and for the sake of everyone — I have to grow stronger without wasting a single second of my day, in order to become a better hero!
            

        
    
    
        
            Maybe I ordered too much.
        
        
            Hahaha! If it&#39;s too much for you, let me know. I&#39;m always ready to help if you ever need it!
…Although, I also think I ordered a little too much for myself.
            

        
    

 3/3
Whew, I&#39;m stuffed! I&#39;m sure this&#39;ll make me have all the energy I need to get by tomorrow!
Heheh, Anzu, you also seem happy after a full meal! It&#39;s really such a fortunate feeling to eat to our heart&#39;s content, isn&#39;t it?
……I wonder if everyone in Ryuseitai is also eating properly…


    
        
          You really are worried about them after all.
        
        
            Yeah… The five of us haven&#39;t been able to get together for a while now, so…
While there are a few of us who show up, there are some who I haven&#39;t seen in a while. I can&#39;t help but worry about them in the end…
            

        
    
    
        
            I'm sure it'll be okay.
        
        
            I want to believe in that, too… However, the person who put Ryuseitai in this position is—… No, I shouldn&#39;t look like this in front of Anzu.
…Alright! I&#39;m going to go for a run to refresh myself!
            

        
    
    
        
            How about buying them a souvenir?
        
        
            A souvenir…? But there are a few who haven&#39;t been showing up, so I don&#39;t know when I&#39;d be able to give it to them…
No…! I shouldn&#39;t give up before even trying. Thank you, Anzu! I&#39;ll try to look for something on my way back home!

 1/3

Anzu! Could you hear me out for a bit!?
Remember the tokusatsu show I got an offer for? They finally decided on its name!
I wanted to let you know about it, since you&#39;ve advised me a lot throughout the process!


    
        
            Finally!
        
        
            Mhm! The details of the show aside, I definitely didn&#39;t want to end up reporting to you uncool stuff like, &quot;I couldn&#39;t transform&quot;, or something!
So I&#39;m also really happy I get to inform you about good news…☆
            

        
    
    
        
            And the title is…
        
        
            Oh! I almost forgot to actually say it. The title is — &quot;Supervillains&quot;!
The documents they showed me finally removed the &quot;tentative&quot; disclaimer from the title. The moment I saw that, I felt emotional, like &quot;ah, at last!&quot;
            

        
    
    
        
            I'm so glad to hear that.
        
        
            I&#39;m so sorry for worrying you all this time. That&#39;s all the more why I wanted to share this joy with you…!
There are still a lot of obstacles ahead, but just this step alone makes me so happy! I couldn&#39;t help but report to you about it!
            

        
    

 2/3
Now that we&#39;ve celebrated the good news… The truth is, the actual details of the show haven&#39;t been confirmed yet.
Oh yeah, Anzu — Do you like stories where the hero turns evil?
I&#39;ve heard it&#39;s been a hot topic lately, but other than that…


    
        
            I think I like it.
        
        
            I see… I guess there really is an increasing demand for that type of story lately.
A hero that walks down the path of evil, huh… Mmm, I can&#39;t help but find it frustrating somehow.
            

        
    
    
        
            I can see why people would like it.
        
        
            Yeah, there&#39;s been a lot of stories lately about how evil can be good if you look at it from a different angle.
Well, that&#39;s a different topic from heroes turning evil, though! As for me, I of course love cool, virtuous heroes!
            

        
    
    
        
            I think it depends on the story.
        
        
            Oh, that makes sense. You can&#39;t really judge how you feel about unless you know the context, right?
What&#39;s important here is how the hero turns evil, right? Thank you, Anzu! I can use this as reference!
            

        
    

 3/3
Why did I suddenly mention heroes turning evil? Well… I mentioned that they still haven&#39;t decided on the show&#39;s details, right?
There&#39;s a possibility that we, Ryuseitai, will end up having roles with that sort of concept.
I wanted to hear your thoughts on it as well, so that it may help me with preparing for my role!


    
        
          Something to help you with that…
        
        
            Ohh? You&#39;ll look for references that could help me!? That would be most helpful!
Now that you&#39;re going to help me out, I have to battle through this job so as not to put a stain on all your efforts!
            

        
    
    
        
            It sounds like a hard role to prepare for.
        
        
            That&#39;s true… The heroes I love most are those that are cool and virtuous, after all.
But this is just one of the many important tasks I must undertake as an idol! I won&#39;t slack off just because it isn&#39;t anything similar to my ideals! I&#39;ll make sure to put all my effort in it!
            

        
    
    
        
            I'm always willing to help out.
        
        
            Thank you! The same goes for you, Anzu. If there&#39;s anything you&#39;re struggling with, please let me know.
I may end up turning evil for my given role, but for your sake, I&#39;m always willing to rush to your side as a hero…☆

 1/3

hello, anzu-san~♪ we have such nice weather today, don&#39;t we~?
the sun is so [warm], it is the perfect day to [bathe]~♪
how about you come and [puka puka] with me, anzu-san~?


    
        
            I have work soon.
        
        
            that is a [shame]~… but it cannot be helped.
i also have had so many [jobs] lately that i have to hold back from enjoying my [puka puka] time~…         
            

        
    
    
        
            Is that okay to do when you have work…?
        
        
            i have work to do at [aoumi aquarium] today, so it is fine if i get a bit wet.
just thinking about having a [puka puka] time with all the fishies gets me excited~♪
            

        
    
    
        
            You'll catch a cold!
        
        
            don&#39;t worry. i will be fine as long as i dry myself up~♪
but you seem to have [work] now, so i should not [force] you to join me.
            

        
    

 2/3
oh yes, have i told you anything about my time in [okinawa] during the [ss qualifying round]?
okinawa&#39;s [ocean] is so pretty, and the fishies were so [lively]~♪
it is a little too difficult for us right now but, i hope to go there again with ryuseitai and [puka puka] together~


    
        
            I'd like to go someday, too.
        
        
            we would have even more [fun] if you were with us, anzu-san.
we will relax and enjoy [puka puka] time with everyone… i am sure it would bring us so much joy if we could make this happen~♪
            

        
    
    
        
            Please don't sink too deep in the ocean, okay?
        
        
            anzu-san, you are such a [worrywart]~. i only [puka puka] at the [sandbank], so you will not have to worry.
even then, i would be with heroes who are always willing to come to their [comrade&#39;s] rescue~♪
            

        
    
    
        
            A trip together!
        
        
            fufu, yes. i would also love to have a [private] trip with everyone.
[hawaii] sounds nice. fufu, maybe that is a little too [ambitious]…? ♪
            

        
    

 3/3
anzu-san, if you were to [travel], where would you like to go?
i am fine with anywhere as long as there is a place to [puka puka]~♪
ah, but it would probably be painful to do that in a [cold] place with [drift ice].


    
        
          Please don't do it in a cold area!
        
        
            fufu, i am just [joking]. i know i could die if i were to [puka puka] in [extremely cold] places.
i will settle with having a [splish splash] time, instead~♪
            

        
    
    
        
            I would love to go somewhere warm.
        
        
            yes, it would feel so good to [puka puka] in warm weather, too~♪
also, if we could go to [hawaii] or [guam], we could [meet] fishies different from the ones in [okinawa].
            

        
    
    
        
            Maybe Hokkaido…?
        
        
            [hokkaido]…♪ it is a wonderful [place], isn&#39;t it? it is [blessed] with sea~
and [hokkaido] is abundant with [planktons], so the [fishies] have plenty of food to eat~♪

 1/3

puka, puka…♪ rawr~☆
what do you think? i was scary, wasn&#39;t i~?
i tried to [imitate] a sea [crook]~♪


    
        
            It was cute.
        
        
            yes, i also think [crooks] are [cute]~♪
…oh? wait, that&#39;s strange… i wanted to scare you, though…
            

        
    
    
        
            Sea crook?
        
        
            yes. though there are many kinds of sea [crooks] out there~♪
[orcas], [moray eels], [sharks], [pacific needlefish]… which one came to your mind first?
            

        
    
    
        
            It was scary.
        
        
            fufu, i am glad to hear that~♪ but the truth is, sea [crooks] are scared of you too, anzu-san.
for example, [moray eels] and [bering wolffish] are actually very [timid] fishies~♪
            

        
    

 2/3
am i practicing a [villain role]…?
ah, you heard from chiaki, yes?
it is a little difficult for me, i think. how can i look [scary]?


    
        
            By just acting as you normally would.
        
        
            oh? is my normal self [scary]?
…i seem like a [last boss]? maybe i can just stay as i am, then~
            

        
    
    
        
            Maybe if you snicker in an evil way?
        
        
            oh yes, that is something [baddies] often do~♪ hmm, then i will give it a try.
fu-fu-fu…♪ what do you think? did i perfect the [baddie] role?
            

        
    
    
        
            Maybe by saying something profound.
        
        
            i see~ maybe i should bestow a [divine message] like a [god] would, then?
fufu, i am just [joking]~♪ but this style is the one that [came] to me best~♪
            

        
    

 3/3
you&#39;re wondering if everyone in ryuseitai is okay…?
hmm… i wonder. i have not been able to [see] tetora and midori lately.
i am not particularly [worried] about us being separated, but it is lonely not [seeing] them~


    
        
          We just have to sit and wait, don't we?
        
        
            yes. so please do [watch over] us, anzu-san.
no matter the [predicament], the heroes will come together and [show themselves] in the end~♪
            

        
    
    
        
            It makes me feel lonely, too.
        
        
            if we ended up making you feel [lonely], anzu-san, then we will need to [reflect] on ourselves a little…
after all, we are heroes. we must not make the people watching us feel [sad].
            

        
    
    
        
            Is there anything I can do?
        
        
            i would be glad if you could watch over us. to watch our very moment when we, the heroes, arrive to the scene with [smiles] on our faces.
i am sure that is what would give everyone in ryuseitai [strength]~♪

 1/3

Huh? Anzu-san, what&#39;re you doing here?
There&#39;s a certain media you&#39;d like to use as reference, so you&#39;re here to rent a DVD…?
Oh wow, what a coincidence. I&#39;m on my way to the rental shop &#39;cause I have something I&#39;d like to rent, too.


    
        
            What is it?
        
        
            I just found out there&#39;s an anime with a kinda mascot-like, soft-looking protagonist.
I wanted to watch it to heal myself a little. Are you watching it too, Anzu-san? I haven&#39;t yet, so I still don&#39;t know if it&#39;s interesting or not.
            

        
    
    
        
            Is it a tokusatsu DVD?
        
        
            Of course not. I already get forced by Morisawa-senpai to watch a bunch of them…
I don&#39;t have to go out of my way to rent them, just asking that guy would be enough… He&#39;d probably even lend me bonus DVDs and whatnot… Not that I ever plan to borrow any tokusatsu DVD from him…
            

        
    
    
        
            Do you know of any interesting media?
        
        
            Hmm… I don&#39;t really watch that much stuff, honestly.
Ah— This one tokusatsu movie Morisawa-senpai showed me before was pretty interesting. I watched it a long time ago though, so I don&#39;t even remember the name anymore…
            

        
    

 2/3
Are you asking me if I watch movies often…? Um, I wouldn&#39;t say I do…
I wouldn&#39;t be able to tell you who my favorite director is, and I usually just watch movies that peek my interest whenever I&#39;m in the mood for one.
What about you, Anzu-san? Do you usually watch movies?


    
        
            There's a lot I've watched for reference.
        
        
            That just means you&#39;re thinking about work even when you&#39;re watching movies during your free time, doesn&#39;t it…?
That&#39;s a lot different from how I live life… Now I see how you&#39;re always so busy, Anzu-san…
            

        
    
    
        
            Outside of work, not really.
        
        
            I see… Well, if you&#39;re mostly watching them for work, it makes sense you wouldn&#39;t as much in your own free time…
It&#39;d suck to have your work distract you on your days off, after all…
            

        
    
    
        
            Yeah, I'd say I do.
        
        
            Watching a movie while eating popcorn in a cinema is the best feeling…? Huh, you really are enjoying yourself.
Okay, then since this is good timing for both of us, please feel free to recommend me any movie if you have anything in mind.
            

        
    

 3/3

You were able to rent the DVD you wanted? I&#39;m glad…♪
We spent the whole time just talking about interesting series and our recommendations, that I didn&#39;t even realize the day went by…
But I feel like we got a lot out of it. We&#39;ll get to have a lot of fun watching stuff on our days off, huh?


    
        
          I'm excited to watch what you recommended.
        
        
            I dunno if the anime I recommended is your type, but I personally love it~♪
I hope its fluffy and soft world helps you relax on your day off.
            

        
    
    
        
            About the last one I recommended, the truth is…
        
        
            Huh!? It&#39;s a horror movie…!? But the cover looks so soft and fluffy…!
I don&#39;t like scary stuff, but… Now I&#39;m kinda curious to see how they turn something so soft-looking into a horror.
            

        
    
    
        
            Let me know what you think, okay?
        
        
            Okay. I&#39;d like to hear what you think too, Anzu-san. Ah, but if you didn&#39;t like it, please don&#39;t tell me about it.
I think I&#39;ll feel like dying inside if I had to hear it from you face-to-face…

 1/3

(Yesterday I had work. Today I have work. Tomorrow I&#39;ll have work. Every day from morning to evening is work, work, and more work… Ahh… I&#39;m so depressed…)
(I&#39;m not even a workaholic, but all I&#39;ve been cramming myself with is work…)
I know I&#39;m the one who did all those things, but still… Why did it turn out this way…?


    
        
            Good morning!!
        
        
            Wah!? You scared me, Anzu-san… Good morning.
&quot;You seemed down, so I tried greeting you energetically&quot;…? Please don&#39;t become like Morisawa-senpai too, Anzu-san…
            

        
    
    
        
            You seem down.
        
        
            Good morning, Anzu-san. I&#39;m so sorry for giving off &quot;I wanna die&quot; energy from the early morning…
I&#39;ll manage to get myself back on track once it&#39;s time for work, really… I wouldn&#39;t want to cause trouble for you &#39;cause of my own personal problems, so…
            

        
    
    
        
            It sounds rough with work.
        
        
            I asked to be crammed with work, after all… Even I think I&#39;m crazy for doing that.
But lately I&#39;m really worn out &#39;cause it&#39;s all I&#39;ve been doing… I don&#39;t really wanna feel this way early in the morning, either…
            

        
    

 2/3
&quot;You don&#39;t have to force yourself to do all these jobs&quot;…? Anzu-san… I&#39;m sure you know what&#39;s been happening, right?
Right now, it&#39;s been, how do I say it… In short, I just don&#39;t wanna see anyone from Ryuseitai at the moment.
I know I&#39;m being selfish. But I just mentally can&#39;t do it…


    
        
            You can say whatever you like.
        
        
            You&#39;re willing to hear me out and nod your head to everything I say? You really are reliable, Anzu-san.
And meanwhile, I&#39;m just a coward… Ah wait, I shouldn&#39;t be so negative… Ahh… I really can&#39;t stand myself.
            

        
    
    
        
            I'm sure they all understand.
        
        
            That&#39;s what hurts so much. Everyone knows how it&#39;s been for us lately, and yet… we&#39;re still so tense with each other.
It feels like we&#39;re all forced to be together, walk on eggshells around each other, and avoid dampening the mood as much as possible… It hurts so much…
            

        
    
    
        
            What hurts the most?
        
        
            Maybe it&#39;s how powerless I feel, and how it feels like all I&#39;m doing is just throwing tantrums… Or maybe how Morisawa-senpai doesn&#39;t bother talking to his own unit members about anything… Or maybe how nothing&#39;s been working out for us…
I don&#39;t even know anymore… What&#39;s hurting me this much…?
            

        
    

 3/3
I ended up making you listen to my vents again… I&#39;m so sorry.
I say I wanna be left alone, but then when I am left alone, I just end up drowning in my depression… I&#39;m such a pain in the ass, aren&#39;t I…
Either way, thank you so much for hearing me out, Anzu-san.


    
        
          I'm grateful, too.
        
        
            &quot;No matter the reason, I&#39;m glad to see you working really hard&quot;…? I guess so…
But I feel like a part of me was saved hearing that. Alright… I&#39;m starting to feel a lot better now, so I&#39;ll do my best at work.
            

        
    
    
        
            You can always rely on me.
        
        
            Mmm~… I feel like I&#39;ve said this before but, I don&#39;t feel right to give more work to someone who&#39;s already so busy…
That&#39;s why this time around, I&#39;m just grateful to know you feel that way. I don&#39;t really like it when all I do is just depend on others, anyway.
            

        
    
    
        
            I'm glad I could help.
        
        
            You really, really helped me out. I barely have anyone I could vent about all of this to…
I&#39;d like to repay the favor through work. I don&#39;t slack off at work in the first place, but still, I&#39;m going to work extra harder today, I promise.

 1/3

I have watched historical dramas with an evil magistrate, but how would an evil ninja be like…?
Hmm… Not to mention, ninjas&#39; very livelihood is in working within the shadows. I feel as though that is evil-like in of itself…
Mm—!? I sense a presence behind me… Ah, it was you, Anzu-dono!?


    
        
            Sorry for approaching you without saying anything!
        
        
            This is just the fruits of my intense ninja training!
A ninja must never lower their guard! We live in a harsh world, after all!
            

        
    
    
        
            You've really grown, haven't you?
        
        
            Heh! ♪ I am a real ninja, after all!
I cannot continue to have you take the upper-hand!
            

        
    
    
        
            Ah, you noticed me.
        
        
            You purposely tried to hide your presence!?
You wanted to help me with my ninja training…? Please tell me beforehand, then.
            

        
    

 2/3
Mm? What was I pondering about? Ah, you heard me earlier?
You see, I may have to play the role of a villain in one of my jobs.
So I have been trying to decode what an evil ninja would be like.


    
        
            That sounds difficult.
        
        
            Indeed… In the first place, to be a ninja is to serve your lord.
My image of an evil ninja would depend on the sort of evil person my lord would be…
            

        
    
    
        
            A ninja role, huh?
        
        
            Ah! Actually, it hasn&#39;t been decided yet if I will be a ninja.
I simply just hope I can be, that is all… Ehehe, perhaps I am getting a little too ahead of myself?
            

        
    
    
        
            Do you think you can do the villain role?
        
        
            I-I am certain I can! As Ryusei Yellow, I cannot overlook the evil rampant in the world, but…
That is a different matter, and this is its own matter! A ninja never involves their personal affairs in their tasks!
            

        
    

 3/3
That reminds me, did you have something to speak to me about, Anzu-dono?
You have been worried about everyone in Ryuseitai…? So you wanted to check up on me?
I very much appreciate you doing so, but I feel bad that we made you worry this much…


    
        
          Don't overdo it, okay?
        
        
            Of course I won&#39;t! Regardless, I have always believed in my comrades.
All for one, one for all! That is what makes us Ryuseitai!
            

        
    
    
        
            Are you alright?
        
        
            I&#39;m alright. Midori-kun seems to be aching a little, and it worries me, but…
I&#39;m sure everyone will be alright, as well. Our hearts are always one and the same, after all.
            

        
    
    
        
            You can always rely on me.
        
        
            I&#39;m extremely grateful to hear that. I believe in everyone, but…
It feels much more reassuring when you have someone by your side during harsh times, doesn&#39;t it?

 1/3

Aaalright! I&#39;ve bought everything I need.
Mm? Oh, Anzu-dono! It is a pleasure to see you here.
Were you also shopping? If it&#39;s too heavy on you, I will assist you!


    
        
            Maybe I'll take you up on that offer…
        
        
            Understood! You are always helping me out in everything, so—
Please do allow me to assist you wherever possible, even for trivial matters!
            

        
    
    
        
            Are you alright?
        
        
            I also have my own shopping bags to carry? No, no, there is no need to worry over me.
As a ninja who has been building up a lot of experience through training, this is nothing for me!
            

        
    
    
        
            It's heavy, y'know?
        
        
            All the more reason that I should assist you! Worry not, this is simply just another part of my traini—
Gwuh!? I-It&#39;s much heavier than I thought…!? I almost dropped it out of surprise…
            

        
    

 2/3
Ah, you&#39;re wondering what I bought?
I have a mission that requires me to travel far away. Thus, I went shopping in preparation for that.
I must always prepare beforehand before conducting in any intelligence gathering!


    
        
            That sounds tough.
        
        
            This is simply just a natural part of life as a ninja! Ah, actually, this doesn&#39;t just concern the way of the ninja.
I always ensure to do the exact same thing with my Student Council and idol work, as well!
            

        
    
    
        
            That's true.
        
        
            Indeed, you also busy yourself with a lot of preparation for a job, yes?
I cannot express just how grateful I am for all the hard work you put in for our sakes!
            

        
    
    
        
            Is there anything I can help with?
        
        
            I am grateful that you feel that way, but I will be alright. It&#39;s nothing I require troubling you over.
I know you are a very busy person, Anzu-dono. I mustn&#39;t depend on you for every little thing!
            

        
    

 3/3
Speaking of travelling far… Do you ever go somewhere far away on your holidays, Anzu-dono?
I make sure to continue my ninja training even on my days off, so I don&#39;t usually go outside.
However, I do tend to feel like going to places that are used for historical dramas.


    
        
          I'm more of an indoors person, I think.
        
        
            I see… You usually spend your time at home on your days off, as well?
You are always such a busy person, after all! I would love to see you rest a little on your holidays.
            

        
    
    
        
            I'm not usually at home.
        
        
            You aren&#39;t!? That&#39;s incredible, Anzu-dono! For you to be able to set foot in so many places all over…!
I, too, should not settle with only the thought of going, and make sure to turn it into a plan of action.
            

        
    
    
        
            How about we go together?
        
        
            Are you sure…!? Then I would love to invite Kanzaki-dono over so that we may go to together!
Please do let me know when we can go together! I&#39;m excited already~♪

 1/3

…Hmm. So this is the planning of that show Midori-kun announced in Comet Show the other day?
&quot;A blockbuster that will go down in tokusatsu history&quot;… Sounds pretty big.
I spotted some famous heroes even I know of in the list. Even heroes from overseas&#39;ll appear, huh?


    
        
            You know a lot.
        
        
            Ahaha, I can&#39;t beat Morisawa-senpai when it comes to this, though.
The heroes I used to watch when I was young are appearin&#39;, too. I&#39;m so excited! ♪
            

        
    
    
        
            From American comics?
        
        
            Yeah, there&#39;s a buncha heroes from all over the world in this list.
I even saw one that comes from a movie that just came out… Is that gonna be okay, copyright wise…?
            

        
    
    
        
            It's exciting, isn't it?
        
        
            I&#39;m so excited to know what role we&#39;ll be takin&#39;!
Since we&#39;re gonna be part of it, I gotta make sure to act as best as I can, to make it the best show it can ever be!
            

        
    

 2/3
…Ohh, there&#39;s a whole buncha other plans too, huh?
Oh yeah, I heard Ra*bits is gonna try participating in a variety show.
I think Tomoya-kun said it was called &quot;Bogie Time&quot;, or somethin&#39;.


    
        
            Have you ever watched that show?
        
        
            I&#39;ve never even heard of it before.
Oh, it used to be broadcasted in the past, huh? Remakes are the thing lately, so maybe it&#39;ll be a hit~♪
            

        
    
    
        
            The punishment game is…
        
        
            Punishment games are a staple in variety shows, huh?
Although, I don&#39;t think there&#39;s been as many severe punishments nowadays. I think that&#39;s for the best, personally!
            

        
    
    
        
            Maybe next time, it can be Ryuseitai…
        
        
            A variety show for us? Aight, please leave all the athletics and cooking-themed shows to me! ♪
Talk shows…? Uu~myu… Not sure &#39;bout that one…
            

        
    

 3/3
Do you have a meeting after this, Anego?
…You&#39;re gonna head back to Yumenosaki? Ohh, then I&#39;d love to join you!
Ryuseitai-N will disband soon, but I&#39;d like to give my juniors one last practice session.


    
        
          I'll join you.
        
        
            Huh, are you sure!? Aren&#39;t you busy…?
…It&#39;s a good timing, &#39;cuz you wanted to show Kurone-san how to do a practice session? Aight then, I&#39;d like to take up on your kind offer! ♪
            

        
    
    
        
            Then how about…
        
        
            You&#39;ll join our practice session?
My juniors&#39;ll be super happy too, I&#39;m sure! It&#39;s not every day that we get to have Anego&#39;s guidance, after all!
            

        
    
    
        
            You're so kind.
        
        
            …I&#39;m not kind. I&#39;m just doin&#39; it for my own satisfaction.
Ah, sorry, I dampered the mood there. Sadly, Ryuseitai-N&#39;s just gonna have to disband either way.

 1/3

(……I wonder if Morisawa-senpai is still at the doctor&#39;s office…)
(In the end, we called it a day before we even got the chance to talk properly, but… I have the right to check up on how he&#39;s doing, at least.)
Ossu! Nagumo Tetora at the door! I&#39;m entering!


    
        
            What's wrong?
        
        
            Huh? It&#39;s only you here, Anego…?
…You&#39;re taking after the place while Sagami-sensei is gone? Ahh, so that&#39;s what it is…
            

        
    
    
        
            Ossu!
        
        
            Woah, Anzu-Anego!? What&#39;re you doing here? Did you also get hurt…?
…You were asked to take care of the place while Sagami-sensei is gone? Whew, I&#39;m glad it isn&#39;t anythin&#39; serious, then!
            

        
    
    
        
            Did you get hurt?
        
        
            Huh? Is Sagami-sensei not around? I didn&#39;t hurt myself or anything, though…
Morisawa-senpai got injured during practice, so I wanted to check up on him. But I guess I just missed him…
            

        
    

 2/3
Oh, I see. As soon as you came here, Morisawa-senpai was on his way out.
……He looked to be doin&#39; okay? I&#39;m so glad to hear that.
Oh yeah, what did you have to do here, anyway?


    
        
            I have something to deliver…
        
        
            Ohh, a fan-letter for Rain-bows? Sagami-sensei&#39;s still got a buncha fans, huh?
I watched a recording of the performance, and it really surprised me to see Morisawa-senpai look so different from the usual. I didn&#39;t know he could make those expressions!
            

        
    
    
        
            I was asked to…
        
        
            Sagami-sensei wanted to rest a bit, so he asked you to take care of the office…?
Anego… You should&#39;ve said no! In fact, I&#39;ll go and tell him to get his act straight, myself! He&#39;s slacking off on his job!
            

        
    
    
        
            I'm here to borrow a book.
        
        
            Ahh, Sagami-sensei&#39;s got the qualification of a sports physician, right?
So you&#39;re learnin&#39; how to do first aid? That&#39;s so cool! That&#39;ll come in real handy, won&#39;t it?
            

        
    

 3/3
Anyway, sorry for stayin&#39; around for so long.
I&#39;ve got circle activities coming up, and I promised Hiiro-kun I&#39;d meet up with him early to clean the dojo.
Take care while watching over the place. Aight then, I&#39;ll see you—


    
        
          Wait a second.
        
        
            Are these weet sheet packs? I&#39;m not injured anywhere, though…
…You&#39;re giving &#39;em to me in case I ever end up getting hurt, &#39;cuz it&#39;ll help heal the wound faster? That&#39;s true. I&#39;ll take &#39;em, then. Thanks a bunch!
            

        
    
    
        
            Good luck!
        
        
            Ossu! …Well, it&#39;s only me and Hiiro-kun that&#39;ll show up for circle activities today.
Our seniors didn&#39;t have the time in their schedule, sadly. Can&#39;t do much though, we&#39;re all busy with our work.
            

        
    
    
        
            Um…
        
        
            Huh? If I have any worries, I can always come to you &#39;bout it?
Ahaha… I&#39;d like to  sort through my feelings first before askin&#39; someone. Once I&#39;m ready to talk, please do lend me an ear.
