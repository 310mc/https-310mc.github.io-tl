(Hmhmhmmm~♪ You’ve always gotta ask an idol whenever you’re in trouble!)
(Though, well— I wasn’t actually in trouble or anything…)
(But UNDEAD taught me a valuable lesson in Idol ☆ Hijack:[1] It’s important to do the norm without complaints!)
(I thought going to school would be a waste of time, but since I got advice from idols, I figured that I could try going to my club…)
(And boy, was that the bestest, greatest idea I’ve ever had! Both Morisawa-senpai and Takamine-senpai were there!)
(I couldn’t take my eyes off of them, not when they were wearing basketball uniforms for once! It was like candid photos flashing before my eyes! So raa~vely!)
(Everything’s all thanks to that radio!)
(I wanna send them another message thanking them, but UNDEAD aren’t the hosts this month.)
(I could also just thank them in person, but you’re not supposed to do that as a fan. I gotta make a line between what I do in my private time and what I do for work as an idol.)
(Besides, it’ll be tricky to send a message on another occasion if they find out that the “Love-swan” pen name was me.)
(I did my best keeping it a secret that every week, I’ve been listening to their podcast in bed with my earphones! I don’t want all of my effort to go to waste!)[2]
(—… Oh, he’s here!)

(Sigh… so depressing…)
(That guy told me upfront that he’s showing up to the club as a former club member, so I tried coming, too…)
(But the club recently got a lot of new members I dunno anything about… and it was painful being asked for basketball advice…)
(I’m not an expert in basketball. You guys need to ask someone who’s actually passionate about it.)
(They asked me if I could show up to the club again while I was getting ready to go home, but I’m gonna be busy with work for a while… so it makes sense if I can’t come, right? Right.)
(I’m gonna try avoiding our clubroom so they don’t talk to me…)
(I left the place as fast as I could, but maybe I should wait for Morisawa-senpai…)
(He said that he’s going to the staff room first, though… Mmm…)
(I dunno when he’s coming back, so I can just go back on my own, right…)
(Yeah, let’s go. Sigh, so tired…)

Takamine-senpai, thank you for your hard work today!

—W-Woah?
You surprised me… Umm, you’re Shiratori-kun from Alkaloid, right? Uh, what’re you doing here…?

I was waiting for you. I wanted to talk to you about the Basketball Club.

Basketball Club…?

We were on the same team today. Did you forget already?

(Is he one of the many first years in the club…? I must’ve not noticed him there. I was avoiding eye contact with them so they wouldn’t ask me any questions.)
Sorry, I don’t remember.

(Ahaha… That’s kind of a shame.)
Please don’t worry about it! I’m happy enough that we were on the same team together~♪
If you’re heading for the dormitory, could we go there together?

(Uuu… I wanna say no… I can’t walk with people I don’t know well… I wouldn’t know what to talk about…)
(But I just said that I don’t remember him, so I’m already starting to feel bad…)
… Sure, why not.

Yaaay! ♪ Thank you so much, Takamine-senpai~☆

M-Mhm…
(I’m such a bore to be with, though… He’s just gonna be disappointed…)

Location: Time Street

—And the look you had in your eyes right when you got the ball was super duper ra-vely!

“Ra-vely”…?

Yes! The sweat flying off of you and your heavy breathing! You look so handsome no matter what you do — your very being is fanservice to people!

Uh…Uh-huh…
(This kid’s been watching me reaaally closely… Now I’m worried… I hope I wasn’t acting oddly back then…)

I’m so glad I got to see your basketball moves up close! And I get to go home with you, too! I’m super happy right now! Hehe~ I’m so glad I’m an idol…♪

Ah, yeah, you like idols… I’m guessing that you tell other idols how happy and glad you are, too.

Yup, you bet it! Every idol has something great about them, and I love each and every one of them~!
Like, you’ve got a slightly different feel to you depending on whether you’re in Ryuseitai-M or Ryuseitai-N.[3]
Your expressions are a little softer when you’re in Ryuseitai-M, it’s sooo ra-vely~♪

D-Don’t talk about me… I’ll die from embarrassment…

Today was so fulfilling~♪ To be honest, I hadn’t been showing up to the club ‘cause I thought there was no point to it.
But I was wrong! I mean, I got to make precious memories with my seniors just today!

Mmm… I dunno, I still think that it doesn’t really have much of a point to it.
It’s also been a while since I showed up, and it was honestly a pain… There were way too many people. I just had my energy drained…

Really? But you looked like you were really having fun playing with Morisawa-senpai.

What… No way…

There you are, Takamine! You didn’t have to leave without me! That’s mean!

Ugh, there he is…

It’s Morisawa-senpai~! Wow, it’s like, “speak of the devil” and stuff, huh? ♪

Oh? You were talking about me?

No, um, we weren’t. Don’t worry about it…

Hmm? Well, alright. You two worked hard in the club today — are you feeling hungry?
Let’s eat at a cheap restaurant before we head home! It’ll be my treat, since I’m a former club member…☆

Yaaay! ♪ I wanna go, I wanna go~!

You just butt yourself in this conversation like it’s normal… Why’re all three of us going back together now…?

C’mon, Takamine-senpai, let’s gooo~!

What’s wrong, Takamine? I’ll carry you on my back if you’re tired!

Ughh, Shiratori-kun, don’t drag me with you… And Morisawa-senpai, you’re just as tired as I am, so quit overdoing it already…

(Going around places before heading home is the perfect way to enjoy my school life~! So ra-vely!)
(Not to mention, how super duper rare it is to see Takamine-senpai in his school uniform next to Morisawa-senpai! Hehehe~ I made another wonderful memory to remember~♪)
