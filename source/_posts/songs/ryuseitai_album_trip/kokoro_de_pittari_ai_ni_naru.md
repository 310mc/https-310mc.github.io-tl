## Translation Notes 

<em>kokoro de pittari ai ni naru</em> is a figurative song title, translated as “Tightly close within our hearts, love is formed” in my translation. I’d like to break down what each part literally means:

- <em>kokoro de:</em> lit. with heart. There is no given possessive pronoun, so it could be “our hearts”, “your heart”, or “my heart”. <em>de</em> could be “with”, “within”, or even “by”.

- <em>pittari:</em> lit. precisely fits (into something), perfectly suits (something), or comes into contact with something very tightly, without any gaps or spaces. This is usually used as an adjective or adverb (along with a verb, such as “fit into”). In this case, no verb is used in the song’s title. 

- <em>ai ni naru:</em> lit. to become love, to be made up of love, to transform into love, etc… There are many ways “naru” can be translated, and it all depends on its usage in a sentence. <em>ai</em> is lit. love, and does not necessarily refer to romantic love.

With all of this combined including the full lyrics, I decided to lean towards the image of “Coming into contact within the (persona’s) heart very tightly. In doing so, love is formed”. I wanted to focus on how Chiaki wishes to be by the persona’s side on an emotional level, i.e. emotionally nestling close to someone who feels tired after a long day, and being by their side via the heart rather than through physical contact.

As an extra note, Japanese fans are also not too sure what exactly the song title means, and mainly explain their image of it through “vibes”. Hopefully, we can eventually get an explanation of the title’s meaning, but for now, please feel free to interpret it however you deem fitting for the song’s message!

[^1]: I recommend reading the <a href="#Translation-Notes">translation notes</a> for a full explanation of what these lyrics mean.
[^2]: “Simplistic” here is <em>sasayaka</em> (lit. modest, meagre), which also refers to something that doesn’t have much to it except for its form. It’s a word that can be used to humble oneself like “It’s a simple present,” etc.
