      “You won’t be able to see anything if you walk with your head down”

      You’re the one that taught me that

      Through the bustling hours, never leaving me alone
      <br>
      I was even able to find all the precious things I hadn’t noticed before
      <br>
      By straightening my back and looking ahead
      <br>
      “The sky has expanded.”

      It’s because you’re always watching over me in that way
      <br>
      That I can continue believing
      <br>
      In the precious value of feeling love for something that never changes
      <br>
      That’s why, so that you know that I’m also here — no matter how far I am
      <br>
      I'll try reaching out my hand as high up as I possibly can so that you can find me

      It’s normal that we’d all be different, right?

      You would always watch over me just like this
      <br>
      That’s how I was able to eventually grow stronger
      <br>
      I’m able to stand without wavering, in a world that’s constantly spinning
      <br>
      That’s why I want to work hard to deliver compassion
      <br>
      To those feelings that cheer for my loves
      <br>
      It’s the energy that turns hearts to infinite bounds

      That’s why, even if each day is only a little more than the last
      <br>
      I want us to keep delivering those feelings of love to one another
      <br>
      And so that you know that I’m also here — no matter how far I am
      <br>
      I'll try reaching out my hand as high up as I possibly can so that you can find me
      <br>
      I’m green tree to the sky… to the sky!
      <br>
      I want you to find me!
