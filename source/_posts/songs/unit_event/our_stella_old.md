## Lyrics (MV Size)

## Translation Notes

* The word translated as "sing" is <em>kanade(ru)</em> in Japanese. The word shares the same kanji in Kanata’s name (奏).
* Alongside the above note, <em>kanadeau</em> (sing in harmony) can possibly be interpreted as a wordplay of "sing" and "encounter" (<em>deau</em> 出会う).
* "Saved and scooped up" comes from the wordplay for <em>sukuu</em> すくう, which can be read as both "save/rescue" and "scoop". Kanata sings a similar line like this in <a href="https://ensemble-stars.fandom.com/wiki/Ryusei_Hanabi_(Lyrics)" target="_blank">Ryusei Hanabi</a>.
* The horizon, where the sea and sky meet, is a common theme for Kanata, as seen in his first solo song, <a href="https://ensemble-stars.fandom.com/wiki/Marine_Blue_Rendezvous_(Lyrics)" target="_blank">marine blue rendezvous</a>.

Stella x8

A downpour of twinkles rain down
Onto the surface of the ultramarine stage
The ripples enticing our hearts
Are the ebb and flow of our heartbeats
Let us hear the voice of that wishing star


Tonight, we sing in harmony with you
On the Stella that binds the sky and sea together
We were within the same light from the very start


Warm courage sparkles as it flows in
Every time we share that courage among each other
It feels as though we were always connected in this way
Before we were even born,
doesn’t it?


The stars we saved and scooped up gently
We’ll return them back to the sky
This is a world covered with
Hundreds of millions of
Smiles


Tonight, we sing in harmony with you
On the Stella that binds the sky and sea together
We will always be within the same light

Warm courage sparkles as it flows in
Every time we share that courage among each other
We know we have always been connected in this way
Before we were even born

Stella x 8
