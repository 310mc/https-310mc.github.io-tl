{% bubble Tetora %}
Hmhmhmm…♪ I’m back~!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Arashi %}
Oh? Welcome back, Tetora-kun.

You’re done with work? That was quick… Didn’t you say you’d take until late at night? So I was expecting you to come back by midnight.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora %}
Ossu! That’s what I thought too, but I managed to get it done way earlier than expected~
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Arashi %}
Ahh, I see. Well, I’m glad you were able to finish up work without any probl—

Kyaah!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora %}
Woah!? W-What’s wrong? You surprised me with that scream!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Arashi %}
Oh my gosh, Tetora-kun! Your ear! Your earlobe!!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora %}
Huh?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Arashi %}
You’re bleeding from your earlobe!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora %}
Mm…?

Ahh, you’re right… I guess the piercing hole isn’t fully formed yet, so maybe my earlobe ended up bleeding from the piercing getting caught in somethin’.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Arashi %}
Ah— Don’t wipe it like *that!* You’ll get an infection!

Come here, I’ll give you a hot soak.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora %}
H-Hot sook…?[^1] What’s that mean? It sounds kinda tasty, like soup…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Arashi %}
Gosh, no. It’s when you use warm saltwater on an infected area to help it heal faster.

Piercing holes are delicate, so we can’t use disinfectant.

Anyway, don’t worry, I won’t hurt you! So come sit here, and stay still.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora %}
Ossu, please go ahead, then!
{% endbubble %}

<div class="msr-narration">
    <p>Time passes…</p>
</div>

{% bubble Arashi %}
<em><th>(Tap, tap)</th></em>… Alright, all done!

Oh? This piercing… It’s not the usual one you wear, is it?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora %}
Ahh, yeah. I had a specific kinda job to do today, and went with a transparent one, so that nobody could notice it.
{% endbubble %}

{% img /img/es/idolstory/manlyback/cg.jpg %}

{% bubble Tetora %}
But maybe it doesn’t suit me much, ‘cuz it keeps gettin’ caught in clothes and stuff… I think that’s why it started bleedin’ this time.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Arashi %}
Mmm, that’s odd… Maybe it’s a defect?

Hmm, and your piercing hole might close up if you don’t keep wearing something until the hole is fully formed…

You know what, how about we go and buy a new one the next time we have a day off? I wanted to window shop for small ear piercings, anyway.

I know a great store we can go to, so would you like to check it out?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora %}
Wha— Really!? If it’s something *you’d* recommend, then ‘course I’d love to!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Arashi %}
Alright then. ♪ Let’s go together on our next day off, okay?
{% endbubble %}

<div class="msr-location">
    <p><span><b>Location:</b> Shopping Mall</span></p>
</div>

{% img /img/es/idolstory/manlyback/2.jpg %}

{% bubble Arashi %}
Kyaan! ♪ Everything is just so *cute!* It’s going to be so hard to decide with this many!

Ah~hh… There’s sooo many cute stuff here, but I really want to save my money… This is so frustrating…

Oh my, I got too ahead of myself. We aren’t here for me, anyway.

So, Tetora-kun — Did you find something you like?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora %}
Uu~myu, mm… Ah! This looks simple enough.

I do like this style, but I dunno how to be fashionable…

I don’t really have any taste in fashion, so… I’d like to ask for your opinion, Narukami-senpai. What do you think of this?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Arashi %}
My my, Tetora-kun! There’s really no need to overthink it. Fashion is all about wearing what you like!

Besides, you do have good taste, you know? That piercing is lovely. I’m sure it’d suit you.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora %}
It would? Well, if I got your seal of approval, then it must be the one~♪ Oh yeah, what’s your kinda style, Narukami-senpai?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Arashi %}
Me? Hmm, good question…

This one’s nice, I like these kinds… Ah, this one! I *love* this style. Mmm, it’s such a shame that I can’t buy it right now. I’ll have to come back when I can spare the money.

Well, no matter! We’re here so you can buy a new ear piercing, and we managed to get that done.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora %}
Ossu! Alright, I’ll go to the cashier and buy this!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Arashi %}
Alright, I’m waiting~ I’ll go check out the clothes store on the other side, okay? Tell me when you’re done!
{% endbubble %}

<div class="msr-location">

</div>

{% bubble Arashi %}
I’m so glad you managed to find something you like.
{% endbubble %}

{% img /img/es/idolstory/manlyback/3.jpg %}

{% bubble Tetora %}
Ossu! I expect nothing less from a shop recommended by you, Narukami-senpai. They had a lotta great, cool styles!

I’ll check it out again sometime. Thank you so much!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Arashi %}
Fufu, that makes me so happy to hear. I’m really glad I introduced you to it.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora %}
—So, here you go.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Arashi %}
Huh? What’s this wrapping?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora %}
It’s my thanks to you for today. I’m sorry it’s such a simplistic gift, though.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Arashi %}
Ehhh!? You don’t have to thank me for anything!

But thank you, I’m so happy. May I open it?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora %}
‘Course!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Arashi %}
—Oh my! Isn’t this the ear piercing that I said I loved? When did you…?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora %}
Heheh. I’m real bad with gifts, so I wasn’t sure what to give ya at first.

But in the end, I just wanna give somethin’ that’d make the person happy! So I secretly researched beforehand what to get you.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Arashi %}
…You’re incredible, Tetora-kun.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora %}
Huh? Didja say somethin’, Narukami-senpai?

Ah! Is it not good enough for a gift!?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Arashi %}
No, it’s perfect. I’m so happy. Thank you so much, I’ll treasure it. ♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora %}
Ahh, I’m so glad you like it! Aight, let’s head home, shall we?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Arashi %}
<th>(Mm~… And here I thought he was still just a cute little junior… This makes me excited for the future…♪)</th>
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora %}
…? Narukami-senpai, what’s wrong? I’m gonna leave without you at this rate~!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Arashi %}
Mhm, I’m coming, Tetora-kun!

## Translation Notes
[^1]: Arashi says <em>hotto soo-ku</em> in katakana (An english word in Japanese characters), so Tetora, unknowing what it meant, related it to <em>hotto suu-pu</em> (hot soup).
