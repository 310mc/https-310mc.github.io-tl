Fuhahahaha! ☆ It really feels nice to have a morning walk!

It’s a shame we stopped hearing the cicadas the moment it got cooler, but summer will come about again! For now, let’s enjoy the coming autumn season!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata v2 %}
there are many things we can do in [autumn] — other than it being a word in chiaki’s name[^1], it is also a season for [art], [sports] and [appetite]…♪

i hope we get to enjoy it with the [kids].
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki v2 %}
Yeah! We’re all too busy, so our schedules don’t match up very often, but — I’d really like to enjoy the autumn season with the five of us together.

…Oh! Oops, we were about to skip past it. Kanata, it’s over here!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata v2 %}
here… ahh, so is [that] what you were looking for?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki v2 %}
Yup, this capsule vending machine!

One of my favorite hero series released a capsule toy, but the machine was always sold out whenever I came to get one.

I heard they restock early in the morning, so I came as soon as possible.

Hehe, and right that was. There are so many capsules inside~♪

I prepared a lot of coins for this moment. I should be able to get the hero with this many—☆

I’ll make sure to come out victorious! Time for my first attempt! Oooooh…!!
{% endbubble %}

<div class="msr-narration">
    <p>Five minutes later…</p>
</div>

{% bubble Chiaki v2 %}
…Guh! I can’t believe I didn’t get a single hero after all those attempts…! Is this the villain’s doing!?

I should’ve brought my wallet… The hero I seek for is still dwelling within the vending machine…!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata v2 %}
that’s too bad… and you were even able to [get] all the [villains], too.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki v2 %}
Yeah… But I shouldn’t mope over this. This only means it’ll be even more exciting the next time I try.

Also, now that I’ve caught so many monster villains, there should be a higher chance for kids to get the hero.

After all, they can’t use as much money as an adult on these machines. I’m glad I could help them from the shadows…☆

Anyhow, that was my task for today. As promised, I’ll now accompany you however you like!
{% endbubble %}

<div class="msr-location">
    <p><span><b>Location:</b> Beach</span></p>
</div>

{% img /img/es/idolstory/heroicheart/2.jpg %}

{% bubble Chiaki v2 %}
It’s a bit warmer here. We should be able to avoid catching a cold with this temperature.

I’ll make a secret base over here. You’re free to *puka puka* as much as you like~♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata v2 %}
[secret base]? are you going to make a big [sand hill]?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki v2 %}
Oh no, it’s going to be for these villain toy figurines. I used to make secret bases in the park’s sandbox when I was young.

But back then I’d make them for heroes, not villains. Anyway, it’s alright to play around like a kid every once in a while, don’t you think?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata v2 %}
yes. the [kids] are not here so you do not have to act like an adult.

please enjoy yourself freely, however you wish to. i will also stay here, and *puka puka.*
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki v2 %}
Alright! Call for me if you ever feel like the waves are about to sweep you away. I’ll come rushing to you immediately!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata v2 %}
i’m fine. the [waves] are very calm today.

…oh?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki v2 %}
I hear people chattering… Hmm, it seems like some primary school kids are playing hero pretend.

But something seems off…?

<th>(Hm… It sounds like they’re arguing over who’ll have to play as the villain. They’re trying to push the role on the timid-looking boy…)</th>

We can’t let this slide. Let’s go, Kanata!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata v2 %}
okay~♪
{% endbubble %}

<div class="msr-narration">
    <p>Time passes…</p>
</div>

{% bubble Chiaki v2 %}
Fuhaha! I see you’re all full of energy and enjoying yourselves!

…That’s right — I’m Morisawa Chiaki from Ryuseitai, and this here is Shinkai Kanata! I’m so happy to hear you know who we are!

You see, we also love playing hero pretend. Could you let us join you? Oh yes, I don’t mind playing as the villain! ☆
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata v2 %}
then i will play the [hero].

[dark chiaki]! i’ll defeat you without fail and protect the peace of the city!

take this, [ryuseitai beam]! pew pew pew!
{% endbubble %}

{% img /img/es/idolstory/heroicheart/cg.jpg %}

{% bubble Chiaki v2 %}
Bwahahaha! You barely even scratched me! What could you *ever* do on your own!?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata v2 %}
why you~, what a tough [villain]. i won’t be able to defeat him by myself. everyone, let’s combine our powers!

ready~, set— pew pew pew pew pew!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki v2 %}
GAAAAAAAAAH!? N-No, how could this be—! <em><th>(collapses)</th></em>
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata v2 %}
we did it. we achieved this [result] because we cooperated together, peace\~☆
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki v2 %}
Hehe, it’s not so bad to play as the villain every once in a while. I’m happy you all enjoyed it!

Now then, it’s quite clear to me that you all love to be heroes. But that doesn’t mean you should force someone else to be the villain, does it?

Could someone who forces others to do what they don’t want to do truly become a hero?

The real evil isn’t playing as the monster villain role — it’s when you hold a selfish, wicked heart.

Listen up, kids! I want all of you to grow and become kind, splendid heroes who save the weak!

Oh? You’d like to try playing as the villain? Why, of course you can! You can be Dark Chiaki No.2! ☆

Mhm, looks like our job here is done. Farewell, everyone! May we meet again!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata v2 %}
ufufu. with this, we were able to protect the [peace], right, chiaki?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki v2 %}
Yeah! Hero shows always end with a happy ending of everyone smiling! Fuhahaha! ☆
