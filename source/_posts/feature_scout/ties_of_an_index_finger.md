<th>(Gahh…! I can’t <em>believe</em> I’d make a mistake like this…! I tripped on the steps and fell down…)</th>

<th>(I’ve been fortunate enough to get a lot of work lately, so although I thought I was feeling alright, I may have built up more exhaustion than I’d expected within the past few days.)</th>[^1]

<th>(The exhaustion led me to be less careful than usual… And in my carelessness, I ended up injuring myself.)</th>

<th>(Hurting myself as a result of being so occupied with work is only proof that I haven’t been taking proper care of myself. I’m so pathetic…!)</th>

{% bubble Chiaki %}
—Please excuse me.

…Whew, nobody’s around.

Ermm, am I allowed to use one of the antiseptics laid out here…? All the equipment I need is here as well, so I think this will be enough to—
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Subaru hidden %}
Excuuuuse mee~!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki surprised %}
…!?

<th>(Oh shoot—! I instinctively closed the curtains around the bed to hide myself…!)</th>
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Subaru hidden %}
Huh? Nobody’s around? I wanted to ask where the nail clipper is~…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki curious %}
<th>(Mm? I recognize that voice very well.)</th>

<th>(I’ll make a small opening between the curtains to check who it is.)</th>
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Subaru curious %}
Mm~? Where’s the nail clipper… In the drawer? Or someplace else—…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki %}
So it <em>was</em> you, Akehoshi.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Subaru surprised %}
What the—!? A severed head popping out from the curtains…!?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Subaru %}
Wait, no — it’s just Chi\~chan-senpai. Yahoo\~, yahoo\~! ☆
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki grin2 %}
Mhm, yahoo to you too…☆
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Subaru %}
I’m so glad there’s someone else here~ I’m looking for the nail clipper. Any idea where it is?

My nail’s a little chipped and it keeps snagging my clothes, so I wanna trim it.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki %}
If it’s the nail clipper you’re looking for, wouldn’t it be inside the case on top of the desk? I’d assume it’d be kept in the same place the scissors are stored…

Ohh, it is! Here you go, feel free to clip your nails with this.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Subaru %}
Thanks, Chi\~chan-senpai\~♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Subaru curious %}
…By the way, what’re you doing here? I mean, this is the doctor’s office, so is it ‘cause you’re feeling unwell or something?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki awkward %}
N-No? There are no problems with my physical condition. My body is as healthy as can be!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Subaru serious %}
Ehh~ Is that really true?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki worried %}
<th>(Guh— He’s clearly suspicious of my left hand after I hid it behind my back!)</th>
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki srsthinking %}
<th>(I wasn’t really lying when I said there are no problems with my health… But should I really ignore his feelings and keep up the facade when he’s clearly worried about me…?)</th>
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Subaru glare %}
*Staaare…*
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki frustrated %}
………
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki sigh %}
—The truth is… I accidentally injured myself, so I came here to treat my wound.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Subaru yare %}
I <em>knew</em> it. You suddenly went quiet, after all~ I figured something was up.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Subaru %}
I’m guessing your left hand’s what got hurt? Show me, I’ll treat your wound as thanks for finding the nail clipper for me.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki worried %}
M-Mm. It’s just a small injury, really.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Subaru smilesoft %}
Doesn’t change the fact it’s an injury, though. You gotta be more careful, y’know~ We’re idols.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki awkward %}
…Haha, that hurts to hear.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki grin2 %}
But worry not! No matter what, I’ll make sure to at least protect my face to the very end, for the sake of my idol profession…☆
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Subaru frown %}
Gosh, that’s <em>not</em> the problem here… And stop moving, I’m gonna put a band-aid on your wound.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki sigh %}
Mm… Sorry.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Subaru curious %}
I was expecting a pretty big wound, since you were hiding it and everything.

Other than your index finger, you’ve just got a little scratch on your hand. So why did you hide such a small injury?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki awkward %}
W-Well, that’s because…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki srsthinking %}
<th>(I already confessed to Akehoshi that I accidentally got injured. And he even went through the effort to treat my wound… So lying here would be—…)</th>

………
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Subaru yare %}
And he goes silent again. Is it something you can’t tell me?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki shocked %}
N-No, that isn’t it…! It’s just something I don’t want anyone to know, not just you, Akehoshi…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki frown %}
However… I won’t forcibly try to hide it from you, either. It’s all pretty pathetic of me, though…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Subaru serious %}
…What do you mean?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki frown %}
I was hoping nobody would find out that I got hurt. I didn’t want anyone to see me like this.

I mentioned that it happened by accident, right? That’s exactly what I mean — It’s an injury I could’ve avoided if I was just a little more careful. I wouldn’t normally trip on some steps.

…It was only once I got injured that I finally realized, “Ahh, I really might be exhausted after all…”
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki sighdrop %}
But there’s just no way I could admit that I was so tired from all my work that I became careless enough to injure myself.

It would just be awful of me to say that — I’m so grateful for each and every job offer I’ve been receiving, after all… It would be so pathetic and disappointing coming from me.

So I just didn’t want anyone to know this side of me… Actually, I wanted to hide the <em>entire</em> thing like it never happened. That’s why I immediately hid it from you as soon as you saw me.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Subaru grin %}
…Take this!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki surprised0 %}
—Oww!?

Wha— What is it…!? You’re gripping my bandaged finger! Is this an Akehoshi-style good luck charm!?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Subaru smileconfident %}
Yup, it is. It’s a good luck charm that prays for the uncool Chi~chan-senpai to disappear.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki shocked %}
Un…cool…?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Subaru smilesoft %}
You getting injured isn’t what’s uncool—

It’s the way you <em>think</em> that you’re uncool that I find waaay more uncool, Chi~chan-senpai.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki worried %}
Guhh…! Your words cut deep in my heart, Akehoshi…!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Subaru norsmile %}
I mean, the reason why you were exhausted enough to accidentally trip was ‘cause you were working your butt off on all your jobs, right?

Well, you could just rest a little or take it easier at work to avoid exhaustion, but… I doubt that’s something Chi~chan-senpai can do.

So that’s why I think there’s no point in hiding an injury that happened <em>because</em> you were so hard at work that you didn’t even have time to think about yourself.

After all, you’re just gonna keep working hard, aren’tcha, Chi~chan-senpai? Then why not think of this injury as proof of your hard work?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki serious %}
…Proof of…my hard work.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki srsthinking %}
<th>(…Akehoshi has got a point. It doesn’t seem right to regret the injury so much that I end up rejecting my *hard work*…)</th>

<th>(I’ve been fortunate enough to enjoy every one of my jobs. And even when it isn’t something hero-related, I’ve been able to build up experience as an idol.)</th>

<th>(That’s why, this injury could perhaps be—)</th>
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki norsmile %}
A man’s own medal, maybe. That’s a much cooler way to call it.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Subaru curious %}
…?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki grin2 %}
Thank you, Akehoshi. Because of you, I feel a rush of joy surge through me…! ♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Subaru surprised %}
Woah— Hold on! Ahh~! Don’t hug me outta nowhere!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki grin2 %}
Don’t say that~ Accept my feelings of gratitude…☆
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Subaru frownshake %}
Gah, don’t squeeze me so tightly!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Subaru smile %}
<th>(…But, I feel like it’s been a while since I’ve seen him be his suffocating self…?)</th>

<th>(Yeah, <em>this</em> is how Chi~chan-senpai’s supposed to be like…☆)</th>
