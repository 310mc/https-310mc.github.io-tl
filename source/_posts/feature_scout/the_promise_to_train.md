{% bubble Tetora v2 %}
‘Suuup~!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora awkward0 %}
—Wait, I’m the only one here, so there’s no point in greetings… I arrived way earlier than our appointed meeting time.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata smileconfident %}
hello, tetora. you are very [early] today, aren’t you?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora surprised0 %}
Woah!? You were here, Shinkai-senpai!? You came out from under the desk all of a sudden and surprised me!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata v2 %}
fufufu, i am sorry. i also arrived here too early, so i had a lot of [free time] to spare.

it is the same for tetora, yes? you are here [one hour] earlier than the meeting time.

is there something you wanted to do?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora v2 %}
Nah, it’s nothing special.

I was just thinking of using this spare time to train a li’l.

What ‘bout you, Shinkai-senpai? Why’d you show up so early? If you’ve got too much time to spare, I feel like you could’ve come much later instead.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata v2 %}
i had work to do at the [aquarium] since the morning. i finished it early, so that is why i arrived here early as well.

considering how long it takes to come from the [aquarium] to this [building], i thought i would actually be late instead.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora v2 %}
Ohh, so that’s why. So you had work to do at the aquarium? What did you have to do?

I’m guessing it’s feeding the fish and cleaning the water tanks?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata v2 %}
no, the other [staff] members do that. though, i would like to do it, too.

but if i were to do those tasks, i would end up becoming the fishies’ [food].
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora shocked %}
H-Huhh!? What do you mean by that!?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata yare %}
the [water tanks] are very [deep], after all~… i cannot swim, so i would simply drown and become one with the [seaweeds].
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata v2 %}
seaweed, seaweed…♪ they are the sour and tasty fruits of the sea, yes~?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora curious %}
H-Hah… I guess? Um…? How’d this conversation suddenly become ‘bout seaweed?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata serious %}
tetora, do you dislike seaweed?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora serious %}
No, I don’t dislike it or anythin’… It’s just, uh—…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora awkward0 %}
<th>(Woah, it’s been a while since I’ve been alone with Shinkai-senpai, so I almost forgot… Talking with him <em>always</em> feels like we’re on two different pages.)</th>

<th>(We work together a lot in Ryuseitai, but we’re not really left alone together all that often.)</th>

<th>(Whenever it’s time to meet up, the five of us gather pretty quickly, so I don’t actually end up being alone with him for that long…)</th>
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata curious %}
that aside, tetora… weren’t you going to [train]? if you do not hurry, it will be [time] for the meeting.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora v2 %}
Huh? Ahh, ‘course I will! I was still thinking ‘bout what sorta training to do, that’s all.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata smilesoft %}
fufu, i am also [interested] to know what sort of [training] tetora will do.

what sort of [training] do you usually do?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora v2 %}
Hm\~… Well, I usually go to the gym and do bench presses, or work out on the treadmill\~

Whenever I can’t go to the gym, I go for a long run outside, or do Zen meditation for spiritual growth.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata v2 %}
oh\~ you work so hard, tetora. that is truly wonderful, great job\~♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora awkward0 %}
Erm, please don’t pat my head all of a sudden. I’d rather you do that sorta thing to Shinobu-kun.

Plus, this kinda stuff ain’t really worthy of praise; it’s just part of my daily routine — to the point that I don’t feel comfortable unless I do it.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata sigh %}
hmph… he ran away. i wanted to do “good boy, good boy” to [tetora]… oh well.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata v2 %}
okay then, how about i [train] with you instead, tetora~♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora curious %}
Eh? You wanna train together, Shinkai-senpai? You keep bringing up things outta nowhere, huh?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata norsmile %}
the truth is, there is a certain kind of [training] i have been wanting to try for a long time now.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora v2 %}
Oh? I didn’t know you’re interested in training your body, Shinkai-senpai. It’s kinda surprising.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata norsmile %}
i would like to [improve] myself as a [hero] in ryuseitai as well, you see.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora v2 %}
Makes sense. So what’s the training you wanna try? I might be able to help you.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata v2 %}
fufu, that sounds wonderful. i would love to do [waterfall meditation] with tetora~♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora v2 %}
Ahh, I see… Waterfall meditation, hm? …Huh?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora surprised0 %}
*W-Waterfall meditation…*!?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata smilesoft %}
yes. you can [train] while also [soaking] in [water]. it is exactly what we call [two birds with one stone].
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora worried %}
No, no! Waterfall meditation isn’t that simple, y’know!?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata grin %}
souma did it just fine, so that means we would be fine as well~[^1]
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora shocked %}
Kanzaki-senpai already did it before!?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora srsthinking %}
…I guess it’s not too hard to imagine Kanzaki-senpai doing harsh training like waterfall meditation or secluding himself in the mountains…

But if we’re gonna do waterfall meditation, where on earth would we even do it? There’s no way we could go <em>right</em> this second and seclude ourselves in a mountain…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata v2 %}
there is no need to go to a [mountain]; we could simply do it in the school’s [fountain], yes?

we can splish, splash, and *puka, puka.* because it always has such lovely water flowing through it~♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora awkward0 %}
Well, I’ll give ya one thing; sitting under the fountain’s water jets without a care for how the students look at us <em>would</em> prolly help build our mental strength… But I also feel like we’d lose somethin’ very crucial.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata curious %}
…? i have not lost anything, though?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora frown %}
I’m pretty sure that’s only how you feel, Shinkai-senpai. If I were to do it, I’d just look suspicious to everyone.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata sad2 %}
…so tetora does not want to do [waterfall meditation] after all…?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora sighdrop %}
Uu… Please don’t get disheartened all of a sudden…

I never said I didn’t wanna do it. Waterfall meditation is a pretty honorable training of its own.

It’s just that doin’ it right now, when the weather is this close to being winter-levels, would just lead us to catching a cold, so I’d really rather we don’t.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata sigh %}
you are right about that… i do not want you to catch a [cold], either.

since this is not the right [weather] for it, i suppose we cannot do anything about it~ i will give up the idea for now.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata norsmile %}
but if it were in [spring] or [summer] instead, would you want to do [waterfall meditation] with me?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora v2 %}
‘Course, I’d love to! Training under huge waterfalls is exactly the image of a man amongst men!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata smileconfident %}
then let’s invite the rest of ryuseitai with us, and do [waterfall meditation] together. it is a [promise], tetora.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora smile %}
Ossu! I’m lookin’ forward to it!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata grin %}
fufu, i am so excited for the day when we all gather at the school [fountain] again~♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora surprised0 %}
…Huh? Don’t tell me you’ve already decided that we’ll do it in the water fountain…!?
{% endbubble %}
