{% note narration %}
**Translation Note:** The story title is the typical phrase a servant would say, but in Japanese, it's phrased how Chiaki would say it. Instead of *go-houshi shimasu* (polite, formal way to say it), it's *go-houshi suru zo* (how Chiaki typically speaks, which is informal and masculine).

<th>(Mm~… It’s almost time to start working, but Himemiya still hasn’t shown up. Could something have happened to him?)</th>

<th>(…Oh yeah, I recall this happening once before, when we were working together as part of Rain-bows.)</th>[^1]

<th>(If I remember correctly, that was due to a lack of proper communication between everyone…? Hm, let me check with the staff members, just in case.)</th>
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tori shocked %}
Please excuse me~! I’m so sorry for being late!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki %}
Oh! You’re finally here! We were waiting for you! You’re the type to come right on time, so I was worried something might have happened to you, Himemiya.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tori frownshake %}
Mm~… Well, something did kinda happen. Actually, it’s happening right <em>now</em>.

The truth is, Yuzuru won’t be around for a while because he’s busy with work, so I have to do all my daily necessities all on my own until he’s back.

I only just moved to the Starmony Dorm, and I always left everything for Yuzuru to handle, so I don’t really know how you’re meant to do things.

My servants would do all the work for me if I were to go back home, but… I won’t be able to grow if I keep going back home whenever Yuzuru isn’t around.

It’s just — I don’t know how you’re supposed to do *anything!* When I tried ironing my clothes, I somehow ended up making more creases! How’s that even possible?

Uu… There’s still three days left… What am I gonna <em>do</em>…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki grin2 %}
Hm. I completely understand!

Then how about I take care of everything for you in Fushimi’s stead…☆
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tori curious %}
Morisawa-senpai taking care of everything…? Do you have experience as a servant or something?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki grin2 %}
Fuhaha! Not one bit, actually!

But as an ally of justice, I can’t just neglect someone in a pinch!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tori glare %}
Whaaat. Gosh, you said it so proudly that you got me hopeful~…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki fist %}
Worry not! You can leave eeeverything to me! ☆
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tori %}
Where do you even get that confidence from… Mm~ What should I do… I can’t tell if I can rely on you, but I also really can’t do it on my own…

…Alright, sure. Then I’ll see you tomorrow, okay?

<div class="msr-narration">
    <p>Next morning…</p>
</div>

{% bubble Chiaki %}
Are you awake, Himemiya? I’m coming in! ☆

What a wonderful morning! This is going to be such a great day!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tori %}
zz… zz…

Mm… <em><th>(mumbles)</th></em>… I can’t eat anymore, Eichi-samaa~…♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki surprised0 %}
Ah—! He’s supposed to be awake by now, but he’s still asleep.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki snicker %}
It hurts to do this a little, but if *that’s* how it’s going to be… Take this! My ultimate movee—!

GOOOOOD MOOOORNIIIIING!! ☆
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tori surprised %}
GYAAAAAH!?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki v2 %}
Mhm, it worked like a charm! Good morning, Himemiya! ☆
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tori frownshake %}
Uu, I was having <em>such</em> a good dream… Let me sleep more~…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki grin2 %}
Don’t bury yourself in the blanket! Come on out, Himemiya! Let’s move our bodies to wake ourselves up!

It’s time for “The Unrivaled ☆ Meteorangers!”!![^2] Follow after me!
{% endbubble %}

<div class="msr-narration">
    <p>Four and a half minutes later…</p>
</div>

{% bubble Chiaki grin2 %}
…~♪

Incredible, Himemiya! You’re able to dance along so well just by watching me!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tori sigh %}
*Huff, huff*… I can’t believe he made me dance a whole song…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki grin2 %}
I’m sure that got you wide awake, didn’t it? I feel exhilarated, too! ☆
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tori yare %}
You’re <em>so</em> energetic, this early in the morning…

Yup, I don’t feel like falling back to sleep at all.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tori %}
I should say my thanks, at least. Thank you for waking me up, Morisawa-senpai.

Um, I’ll go wash my face and change my clothes, so could you leave the room, please? I don’t feel comfortable doing it with someone watching.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki grin2 %}
Alright! I’ll go prepare breakfast, then!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki smile %}
<th>(White rice, miso soup, grilled fish…♪)</th> <em>(Humming)</em>

<th>(Alright, everything’s going well so far! It’s all thanks to the beginner-friendly time-saving recipe book I found yesterday! ☆)</th>

<th>(All that’s left is the rolled omelette. Pour the beaten eggs into the pan—…)</th>
{% endbubble %}

{% img /img/es/idolstory/atyourservicemaster/cg.jpg %}

{% bubble Chiaki smilesoft %}
<th>(Then roll the egg once it solidifies… I’m being really careful not to ruin its shape…)</th>

<th>(But the trick is to cook it in a short amount of time, so I shouldn’t do it <em>too</em> slowly.)</th>
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tori %}
…Huh, you’re making Japanese food? Do you like these sorts of meals, Morisawa-senpai?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki %}
There you are, Himemiya. I cooked these meals for your sake, rather than for my taste.

Since I assume Fushimi always makes sure your meals have all the nutrients you need, right?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tori frown %}
Uu~… Yeah, he does, but… I prefer to eat something normal whenever Yuzuru isn’t around.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki snicker %}
Heh-heh-heh… These aren’t the only things on the menu, y’know? Open the microwave oven~
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tori %}
Microwave oven?

…Ah! French fries~! ♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki grin2 %}
It’s hard to tell different types of potatoes from one another, but since these ones were from Takamine Greengrocer, they’re guaranteed to be excellent-quality vegetables.

And vegetables are extremely high in nutritional value! Eat as much as you like!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tori blushjoy %}
Yaaay! ♪ Yuzuru would probably make a disapproving look if he hears about this, but I don’t caaare~!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki grin %}
I’m really glad it made you happy. It was well worth the preparation…♪

Oh yeah, speaking of which — Have you finished preparing for school?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tori %}
Mhm. Thanks to you waking me up, I was able to get everything ready without rushing.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki grin2 %}
Ohh, that’s good to know! Make sure to take this with you, as well.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tori %}
Mm? You made me a lunchbox? I was planning to eat at the cafeteria, though.

I wonder what’s inside… Woahh~!

I know this! This is chara-ben, right?[^3]
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki smilesoft %}
Yeah, it is. While thinking of what sort of lunchbox to make you, a past memory came back to me.

When I was young, my parents would make me a lunchbox like this sometimes. It really made me happy, so I tried making one for you, as well.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki awkward %}
I botched up the technique, so the egg garnish is a little burnt, and the character is misshapen — but that’s part of its charm…! ☆
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tori sideeye %}
………

…I’m not a kid anymore, though.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tori norsmile %}
But thank you for doing all of this for my sake, Morisawa-senpai.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki grin2 %}
Fuhaha! You’re welcome. Eat to your heart’s content, and grow big and strong!

Alright, it’s time to eat. They say that “the day only begins once you eat your breakfast”…☆
