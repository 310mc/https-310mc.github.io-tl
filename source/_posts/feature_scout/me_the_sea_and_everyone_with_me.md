<th>(Hm? I saw something glittering from the corner of my eye…?)</th>

<th>(…What’s this? A sequin…?)</th>

<th>(There’s more dropped on the floor up ahead, but I see a seashell at the end, too. Did someone place it down here, rather than accidentally drop it…?)</th>

<th>(I’m kinda curious to see how far this goes, so I guess I’ll follow the trail.)</th>

…I feel like I’m walking straight into a trap, but maybe it’s just someone trying to lead me somewhere…?
{% endbubble %}

<div class="msr-location">
    <p><span><b>Location:</b> Staircase</span></p>
</div>

{% bubble Kaoru %}
…There’s more around here, too? Must’ve been rough work for the person behind this.

Oh, it’s going past the door now. How many floors have I gone up by now…?
{% endbubble %}

<div class="msr-location">
    <p><span><b>Location:</b> Resting Room</span></p>
</div>

{% img /img/es/idolstory/methesea/2.jpg %}

{% bubble Kaoru %}
…I don’t see any more stuff on the floor. Does this mean I reached the finish line?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Rei %}
Oh? My, my… so the final person was Kaoru-kun?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki %}
We were waiting for your arrival, Hakaze…☆
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kaoru %}
Rei-kun and Moricchi? What do you mean by “final person”? What’re we gathered here for?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Natsume %}
Unfortunately, we don’t know why, Either. But I assume we’ll be guided somewhere now that all of us are Here.

—By the Kitten~♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kaoru %}
Sakasaki-kun… and Anzu-chan’s here too!? Okay, seriously, what’s going on here?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki %}
Mhm, you came here because you followed the trail of items on the floor, right?

We all experienced the same thing and ended up in this room, which means we’ve been led to gather here.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Natsume %}
I thought there’d only be sequins and seashells at First, but I came across some fish scales, Too.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Rei %}
As have I. Fish scales can only mean one thing—I have an inkling of who is behind these acts.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki %}
The person in question is waiting for us with preparations at hand?  …Hmm, I see. You’ve been asked to be our guide by Kanata, right?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kaoru %}
She tried to keep it vague by saying “person,” but Moricchi blurted out the name anyway…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Rei %}
I’m quite interested to see what Shinkai-kun is preparing, and to hear the reason why we’ve been gathered here. Let’s go meet him right away~♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Natsume %}
Rei-niisan isn’t trying to hide it, Either…

Well, to get back on Track… We’re counting on you to lead the way to “that person,” Kitten.
{% endbubble %}

<div class="msr-location">

{% img /img/es/idolstory/methesea/3.jpg %}

{% bubble Rei %}
Hellooo? Shinkai-kun~?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata v2 %}
everyone\~ i am over here\~♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Natsume %}
Hm? Is that an inflatable pool you’re sitting In?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki %}
K-Kanataaaa!! What’re you doing bathing in water during the cold season!? You’ll get sick at this rate—

…Hm?
{% endbubble %}

{% img /img/es/idolstory/methesea/cg.jpg %}

{% bubble Kanata pout %}
gosh, chiaki, you do not need to panic so much. please look closely — notice how there is no [water] in the [pool]?

besides, i do not need to fill a [pool] with [water] to bathe. there is already a [pond] here.

i could always go inside the [pond] if i ever wanted to [soak] in [water]…♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki %}
You’d freeze yourself either way, silly! Keep that for when the weather is warm again, okay? Promise me that…☆
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kaoru %}
That’s good to know, but does that mean that the thing you were preparing was this pool?

Though, I can see balls and plushies and other stuff inside…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata v2 %}
well… i will explain that soon enough. ahem, first off…

thank you for gathering here, everyone.

it took a lot of time and effort to prepare all those [sequins], [seashells], and [fish scales] on the floor, you know~ i had to go all over the [place].

and i had to do it for [four people], too. it was a [toughie].
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Natsume %}
…How did you get away with that with all the security guards Around?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata v2 %}
anzu-san did a lot of work [behind] the scenes for me~♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Rei %}
It was surprising to see you use sequins. Was that the Little Lady’s idea, perhaps?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata v2 %}
fufu, bingo~ anzu-san and i were preparing a looot of stuff so that we could all do a [certain thing] together~
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki %}
Certain thing…?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata v2 %}
surprise! i am [gifting] you all a [ticket] to participate in the [fishing tournament]!

now then, everyone, let’s [fish] together…♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Rei %}
…?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Natsume %}
…?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata v2 %}
hmph, what is with that [look] on your faces! you get to <em>[fish]</em>, you know? it is lots of fun!

can’t you see that [kanatee] wants to see all of you excited to play? its [round] eyes are sparkling with anticipation!

i have even prepared a [prize] for the [winner]. please [play] in the tournament with all your heart…♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kaoru %}
I don’t really get what’s going on, but for the fishing tournament… Are we gonna use the pool for it?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata v2 %}
exactly~ anzu-san and i made a lot of [fishies]; you can see them in the [pool], right?

here we go… <th>*(gets up from the pool)*</th>

anzu-san, could you pass everyone their [fishing rod]?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Natsume %}
Woah! Since when was she holding those fishing Rods? They look Handmade…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata v2 %}
please use these [fishing rods] to catch the [fishies]~♪

bring the [fishies] you catch to me. you get more [points] depending on the fish caught.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki %}
Yeah, I don’t get what’s going on here, but… The two of them seem eager to see this happen, so let’s get started!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Rei %}
Hmm… What on earth is he planning…?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata v2 %}
ufufu, do you all have your [fishing rods]? then let the tournament begin…♪
{% endbubble %}

## Chapter 2

{% bubble Chiaki %}
*Ohhh,* I get it now! There’s a magnet attached to the end of the fishing rod, and also to the fish they made! So we just need to pick them up using the magnet, right?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kaoru %}
We’re out in the open air, so the string keeps shaking from the wind… And the magnet’s small, so this might actually be harder than it looks.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Rei %}
Won’t the magnet lose grip depending on how large the catch is…?

There appears to be a large plush toy in the pool, but I doubt we could catch it with this rod. Hm, I wonder which fish to catch for myself…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Natsume %}
*Fufu,* it looks like I’m the first one to catch Something.

Here you go, Kanata-niisan. I caught a Clownfish.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata v2 %}
great job, nacchan~ you get [tickets] to [aoumi aquarium] for catching a clownfish.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Natsume %}
A pair of Tickets? I’ll go there with Sora sometime, Then. Thank you~♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kaoru %}
Alright! I got something. I caught a starfish and coral at the same time! Isn’t that amazing?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata v2 %}
great job to you too, kaoru~♪ i will gift you fresh [sashimi] for tonight.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kaoru %}
Sashimi for me? Guess I’m gonna get to have a fancy dinner tonight~♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata v2 %}
come on, chiaki and rei, you can do it too!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Rei %}
While I wish I could, the ball is obstructing my fishing~… Little Lady, could you move the ball to the side so that I can fish more easily?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki %}
Oh, you too?

I wanted to catch the turtle, but it ended up concealing itself under the ball somehow… I won’t be able to catch it at this rate.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata v2 %}
oh jeez, i guess i have no choice~ i will adjust its [placement], so please give it another go.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Natsume %}
Heh. Since the two of them are taking a While, maybe I should try catching another One.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kaoru %}
Yeah, I wanna catch a fish this time. I’ll try going for a big catch if possible, while I still can~
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata v2 %}
…♪

anzu-san, what’s wrong?

i look like i am in a [good mood]? you are right~ i am so glad that everyone is having fun with what i have prepared for them.

thank you very much for [helping] me out with this.

it was a lot of fun [drawing] so many [marine animals] and making those [fishing rods]…♪

so as [repayment], i would like to give you this [fishing rod].

…you do not [recall] making this one? of course not, i am the one who made [it], after all~♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki %}
Hm? That looks a lot fancier than the ones we have.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kaoru %}
The magnet’s bigger, too…? You could catch anything with that.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Natsume %}
You could even catch Kanatee, don’t you Think? Try aiming for the magnet on its Back.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Rei %}
…Shinkai-kun, you wanted *her* to catch the large one from the very start, didn’t you?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata v2 %}
fufufu~? look, rei. she is so good at [fishing]…♪

—congratulations, anzu-san. your [prize] for wonderfully catching [kanatee] is…

the [right] to think up a design for my [personal outfit]~♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki %}
Personal outfit?

What do you mean by “right”? Anzu is usually the one to make them in the first place, isn’t she?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Natsume %}
Hm, if he went through all the effort to have her catch a huge one just to gift her the Right…

That would mean Kanata-niisan *wants* his personal outfit to be Made?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata v2 %}
…ehehe~♪

i was [waiting] to see when it would be my turn even before we started [preparing] for the [fishing tournament]—

and at one point, i [heard] that she was going to have time in her [schedule] for my outfit, so i knew i had to take the chance to [plead] for it before then.

after all, the rest of ryuseitai received their [personal outfits]~♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Rei %}
I did not see this coming at all, but I’m glad for you, Shinkai-kun. Little Lady is nodding with a smile on her face.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata v2 %}
yes~ i am so happy to get the [okay] from you…♪

…i could have just [asked] you normally?

mmm… i did not want you to just hear my [request]. i wanted to make the whole process fun before you started on [it].

i got to see everyone [smiling], and, while i felt a bit nervous, i even got to [ask you] to design it in a fun way.

it ended up being a good time for everyone, even more than i expected. and you were even [smiling] all the way… i am so glad~♪

next time, if i could also have wataru, shu, and the children come over and play with a much bigger [pool]… i think that will turn out to be even more fun…♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Natsume %}
Wouldn’t that take a lot of effort to prepare for? I don’t believe the Kitten will be enough for That, so let me help you out next Time.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki %}
Mhm, I’d love to help you two out, as well!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Rei %}
…Hm? It seems like she already has something she needs our help in.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kaoru %}
You wanna know what image we have of Kanata-kun to incorporate it into the design? Hmm, let’s see… He’s definitely got the feeling of the ocean and water and stuff.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki %}
As for me, I’d say “Blue” from his Ryuseitai position… as in, the color blue. Oh, but he gives off a strong impression of the ocean too, of course.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Natsume %}
Hmmm… I can think of many Things, but overall I’d say the waterside comes to Mind. It feels like he’s someone who connects to the sea Itself.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata v2 %}
then… how about we go to the beach?

the ocean is where [things] came to life, so surely ideas for my [personal outfit] could come to life too if we went there.

come on, everyone. even anzu-san is saying that the sea is very important as part of my personal [outfit]~
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki %}
…I feel as though you're mostly pleading for us to join you, but I don’t mind doing so if it’ll help Anzu with the design process…☆
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata v2 %}
fufufu~♪ then let’s [tidy up] and get going.

let’s go search for the perfect [ocean] for me—
