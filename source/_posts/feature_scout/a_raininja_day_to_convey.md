{% bubble Midori curious %}
Mm~ Where on earth is Shinobu-kun…? I heard he was here, but I don’t see where…?

—Mm?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shinobu v2 %}
Oooh—! Shuriken throw, woosh, woosh…! Now a backflip! And then~ Pose! ☆
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mayoi v2 %}
*<th>(snapshot, snapshot)</th>* ♪ Ahh\~ Chief! Wonderful\~! Absolutely wonderfuuuuul!

*<th>(snapshot, snapshot)</th>* ♪ Your gallant form shines so brilliantly as you revel in your way of life…! Absolutely perfectttt!

I’m honored to have the opportunity to witness such precious, irreversible moments with my very own eyes, let alone take snapshots of them with my own two haaands~!

*<th>(snapshot, snapshot)</th>* ♪ Ah! May you please face me and make a suspiciously cute pose once more?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shinobu curious %}
Huh? Suspiciously cute…?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mayoi v2 %}
I’m so sorryyyyyyy! It was a slip of the tongue!

I assure you that was not my true intention, I simply struggle to speak without stumbling on my words! I only wanted you to face me and make an adorably cute pose again, really!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shinobu v2 %}
Ah, I see. Very well then, another pose! ☆
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mayoi v2 %}
Absolutely perfect, Chief~!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shinobu awkward %}
Ehehe. Your compliments make me happy, but I am really not doing anything particularly special, you know?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mayoi v2 %}
*<th>(snapshot, snapshot)</th>* ♪ Oh no, no, quite the contrary! I feel my very nerves and eyeballs bursting out due to your adorable form. Ufufufufu~♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori frownshake %}
…Eugh. I feel like I saw something I shouldn’t have… Maybe I’ll just go…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shinobu %}
Mm? Oh, Midori-kun! You were here?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
Yeah, for a while now. Like, since you did that backflip, I think?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shinobu awkward %}
Aww, you could have told me! There is no need to act so distant~

It is also quite embarrassing to know I was being watched in silence during my practice…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori sigh %}
I don’t think *that’s* the thing to be embarrassed about here…

—Mm? Wait, did you just say practice? Erm, what kinda practice are you even doing…?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shinobu v2 %}
I’m very glad you asked! I will have a photo shoot for my Feature Live’s pamphlet, so I have been practicing for it!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori norsmile %}
Ohh, so that’s why you’re taking photos and everything… The pamphlet you’re talking about is the one with a candid shot of the featured idol, right? So you’re up next, huh…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shinobu srsthinking %}
Indeed. I, of course, have been practicing in order to present an excellent pamphlet…

However, I came to notice a tremendously grave problem, you see…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori worried0 %}
Huh? “Tremendously grave problem”…? You’re scaring me… Is the job seriously <em>that</em> bad…? That means I’m gonna go through it at some point, too…

Can I know what it is, to prepare me for when it’s my turn? What did you notice…?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shinobu sad %}
The fact of the matter is…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori worried0 %}
“The fact of the matter is”…?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shinobu frustrated %}
A ninja mustn’t ever display their moments off-duty…!

That is why I am considering having them present my most gallant moment as a ninja instead. Thus, I asked Mayoi-dono to take various photos of me.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori sigh %}
Why’d I even ask… Wait, doesn’t that mean you shouldn’t even be showing yourself <em>in</em> the photos? Since that just means you’re not actually hidden…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shinobu v2 %}
Well, we <em>are</em> in a generation of endless variety, so I believe that it is acceptable. A ninja has to display his traits to the public somehow, after all.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori sigh %}
How convenient… Well, if you’re fine with it then…

So, as anyone would expect… You’re gonna present yourself as a ninja in the pamphlet, huh?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shinobu v2 %}
Of course I am! The way of the ninja is an inseparable path from my very life!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori smilesoft %}
Yeah, I’ll always love mascot characters, so it kinda feels relieving to know you’ll also always love ninjas.

I don’t think I can be of any help, but just know I’m wishing the best for you.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shinobu v2 %}
Ehehe. Thank you, Midori-kun!

That all being said, why did you come to see me?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori smileexplain %}
Oh, right. I wanted to let you know that Himemiya-kun wants you at the Student Council office as soon as you’re done with your club activities.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shinobu worried %}
Eh? You came all the way here just to inform me that…? I apologize for the trouble… You could have just messaged me, you know?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori norsmile %}
Yeah, I thought of doing that at first, but I wasn’t sure if you’d see it on time, so…

I figured I may as well relay it in-person since I’m heading out anyway.

Anyway, I’ll go home now that you know. I don’t wanna get in the way of your practice, so, yeah… Good luck, Shinobu-kun, Ayase-senpai—

Huh? Wait, I don’t see Ayase-senpai anymore…?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shinobu v2 %}
Ermm— Ah! He’s still taking photos of me from behind those bushes.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mayoi v2 %}
Ufu, fufufufu\~♪ The ever-so-innocent Chief speaking to a classmate is just as deliciousss\~! *<th>(snapshot, snapshot)</th>* ♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori sighdrop %}
He really freaks me out…

<div class="msr-narration">
    <p>The next day…</p>
</div>

{% bubble Shinobu v2 %}
Anzu-dono~! I hope you’re doing well!

Hm? Ah, please do not worry about calling for me all of a sudden. I am well aware that you have a tight schedule.

And either way, as soon as I learned I was next in line for the Feature Live pamphlet, I had prepared myself for the possibility of a meeting with you.

I have thoroughly practiced for it beforehand, as well.

Also… I have something I’d like to speak to you about, anyway.

Regarding the pamphlet — As I am a ninja, I believe it is difficult for me to present myself off-duty.

You see, there is no such thing as “off-duty” for a ninja.

Thus, I have prepared an excellent number of assets that display my ninja prowess in all their glory!

Which one do you think works the best, Anzu-dono?

I personally feel that this one and that one are excellent, but—

Hm? What’s the matter? You’re making a strange face…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shinobu surprised0 %}
Huh…!? Ninjas are off-limits for this job!?
{% endbubble %}

## Chapter 2

<div class="msr-location">

</div>

{% img /img/es/idolstory/ninjarain/3.jpg %}

{% bubble Shinobu sighdrop %}
Uu… Forbidding my ninja-self was the last thing I expected when I mentioned that a ninja off-duty is no longer a ninja…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Yuta hair %}
Ahaha, you got it rough, huh~? I mean, ninja is the first thing that comes to mind when anyone sees you, and vice versa. It’s your very identity, isn’t it?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shinobu %}
Indeed… But I understand where Anzu-dono is coming from.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Yuta hair %}
Hm? What do you mean?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shinobu %}
As you said, it is impossible to think of anything <em>but</em> ninja when one sees me… I have <em>too</em> much devotion to that image, so to speak.

Because of that, I receive a lot of jobs that ask for a different side from me.

I believe that is one of the reasons why she wants to show who I am aside from ninjas this time.

So, I shall follow her wishes to the best of my ability, and seal off “ninja” from myself!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Yuta hair %}
Haha, but I feel like your loyalty is kind of on brand for a ninja…?

I get it, though. It’s good to have a lot of tricks up your sleeve, while still establishing your main selling point.

I’m looking forward to seeing a pamphlet showcasing a whole new Shinobu-kun.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shinobu v2 %}
Thank you, Yuuta-kun!

{% bubble Shinobu sighdrop %}
Mmm~… It’s still raining…

Uuu… The one time I forget to check the weather forecast…! It is not my day today…

<th>(I thought of waiting indoors until the rain slows down, but… It only seems to be getting stronger…?)</th>

<th>(Oh well, I suppose there is nothing I can do about the weather. Now that I have the time to spare, I should think up ideas for my Feature Live.)</th>

{% bubble Shinobu v2 %}
Mm? The glass window is turning foggy from the rain…?

…Oh, I know! Let’s see… <em><th>(scribble, scribble)</th></em>… Nihihi, I doodled lots!

What next… Ah, I know! Like this… *<th>(scribble, scribble)</th>*

Heh! ♪ I drew an adorable frog~! A ninja must always come with their trusty toad partner, after all![^1]

<em>Haa~…</em>

Ohh! It never fails to amaze me no matter how many times I do it!

When I was young, I used to doodle a lot on glass windows during rainy days.

And it would always leave me super duper excited to blow on the glass and make the doodle disappear! It’s like ninja art!

Next up~… *<th>(scribble, scribble)</th>* A ninja always comes with a shuriken! Nin-nin! ♪

<em>Haa~…</em>

Next up— Oh, I know! I’ll draw Momocchi and Thunder.[^2] The rain will suit them as a background!

First you draw this… then this… and done! ♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori curious %}
Shinobu-kun?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shinobu v2 %}
Ah, Midori-kun! Hello, what a lovely coincidence!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori norsmile %}
I just finished work, so… I came to eat a late lunch, and that’s when I spotted you. Are you also here to eat?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shinobu worried %}
No, I was simply waiting for the rain to pass. I forgot to bring an umbrella, unknowing it would rain today…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori smileexplain %}
Ohhh… Alright then, how about we head home with my umbrella after I finish eating?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shinobu v2 %}
Are you sure it’s okay!? That would be a huge help! Thank you!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori serious %}
By the way, what’re those frogs on the window? Did you draw them?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shinobu v2 %}
Indeed I did. I was a little bored, so I drew my partners, Momocchi and Thunder.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori smile %}
They look kinda messy, but that’s what makes them so cute…♪ Can I take a picture?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shinobu v2 %}
Of course!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori smile %}
*<th>(snapshot, snapshot)</th>* —and saved. Thanks.

Oh yeah, did your meeting for the Feature Live go well? You were practicing really hard for it the other day, right?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shinobu awkward %}
Ah—… You ask me that <em>now</em>…?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori worried0 %}
Huh!? Was I not supposed to…?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shinobu serious %}
Ah, no… Actually, it must be fate to meet you here, Midori-kun. I would like to ask for your opinion on something.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori serious %}
Well, okay…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shinobu sad4 %}
You see…
{% endbubble %}

<div class="msr-narration">
    <p>Time passes…</p>
</div>

{% bubble Midori northinking %}
Ninja getting ruled out…? Huh, so that’s what ended up happening…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shinobu worried %}
Indeed… So I wanted to ask you what you think would be a “non-ninja” me…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori frown %}
A non-ninja Shinobu-kun… Mmm…

Honestly speaking, your ninja image is so prominent that I can’t think of anything straight away…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shinobu sightired %}
Uuu… In the end, “ninja” is my only merit… *<th>(sniffs)</th>*
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori curious %}
I don’t think that’s what I would call being a ninja, though…?

And anyway, we’ll need to stick around for a bit longer ‘cause of the rain, so maybe we’ll be able to think of something eventually.

Mm? Oh, actually, the rain is starting to calm down.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shinobu v2 %}
Oh, you’re right! It may fade entirely by the time we head home.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori frown %}
That’d be nice… I know rainy days are good for veggies and stuff, but they personally make me feel depressed…

Carrying an umbrella’s a pain, and it gets so damp and sticky either way… There’s nothing good about the rain…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shinobu v2 %}
You believe so? I feel as though rain has its own perks if you were to look at it from a different perspective~

There are certain types of training you can only do during the rain, and you can even have fun scribbling on glass windows.

Not to mention how nice the weather feels the next day. It makes it worthwhile.

Also, my partners Momocchi and Thunder absolutely love the rain, so I can play with them outside on those days!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori serious %}
…………
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shinobu %}
Hm? What’s the matter?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori norsmile %}
Oh, nah. I was just impressed, like, “Ah, that’s Shinobu-kun for you.” The way you can always look on the bright side of things is one of your best traits. I personally could never do that…

I know it’s not as straightforward as a ninja image, but how about making a pamphlet that showcases all those good traits of yours?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shinobu srsthinking %}
My good traits…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori smilesoft %}
Yeah, I feel like you showed a lot of that just through our conversation…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shinobu cryalmost %}
Uu\~! Midori-kun, I am deeply touched\~! Thank you!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori surprised %}
I’m glad then— Ah! Oh no, the adorable frogs you drew are dripping down from the rain drops… Now they just look horrifying…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shinobu awkward %}
Indeed they are… Water-drop art can only be displayed for a mere moment… It’s truly short-lived.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori sigh %}
<em>Way</em> too short-lived… Paper is always gonna be the best place to draw art in the end…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori norsmile %}
Draw them on paper again when we head home, Shinobu-kun. How about we doodle mascot characters together? I wanna see you come up with a lot of cute stuff…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shinobu v2 %}
I’d be more than glad to! Spending time indoors is the true charm of rainy days! ♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori grin %}
Yaay! I’ll finish my food quickly, okay? I’m so excited.

You’re right, maybe rainy days aren’t so bad after all if it means I get to experience stuff like this…♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shinobu v2 %}
Right, right? You can come up with many ways to enjoy yourself, no matter the weather!
{% endbubble %}
