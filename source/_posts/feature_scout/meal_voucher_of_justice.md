Heya, Staff-san! It’s Shiina Niki from Crazy:B~

Is the Vice Prez around? I’m here ‘cause I heard that he has business with me.

Mm? He’s in a meeting with a customer? He’ll be done in ten minutes?

Aight, could I wait here then? I’ll be in the corner where I won’t be a bother to anyone.

It’s all good~ He told me to come whenever I had the time, and I don’t have anything scheduled for today.

By the way, did the Vice Prez tell you what sorta business he has with me, Staff-san?

Oh, okay~ …Nah, don’t worry, it just means I gotta ask him directly! ☆

Nahaha, thank you for your kindness! Please do your best at work as well, Staff-san~☆
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Niki northinking %}
<th>(If Staff-san doesn’t know either, then I wonder what this means~…?)</th>

<th>(I’m the only one he asked to come, and it feels somewhat off… Like, a li’l baffling.)</th>

<th>(I seriously don’t have a single clue what it could be~… Did someone in Crazy:B cause trouble again?)</th>

<th>(But in that case, the one who’d get called over is the leader…)</th>

<th>(Although, I feel like calling for Rinne-kun wouldn’t make anything better, would it…)</th>

<th>(Then am I here as a substitute for the leader? But even then… HiMERU-kun or Kohaku-chan suit the job way better than I ever would.)</th>

<th>(Mm\~… I really hope it isn’t some kind of difficult discussion\~…)</th>
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Ibara %}
—I’m sorry to keep you waiting, Shiina-shi.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Niki %}
Vice Prez! I hope your meeting went well!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Ibara %}
Thank you very much for coming all the way here. Let’s head over to the main topic immediately, why don’t we?

Please take this.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Niki idle %}
A leaflet of a newly refurbished restaurant…? Nah, wait, it doesn’t look like that. Umm…

“Dance Workshop”?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Ibara %}
Yes. It’s a workshop aimed towards ES idols.

Sometimes, your choreography seems sloppy compared to the other Crazy:B members.

This workshop is free of charge, so I’d like you to participate in it, as it’d be a great opportunity for you to learn.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Niki awkward %}
Y-Yaay… I’ll do my absolute best…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Ibara serious %}
You say that, but you clearly don’t seem happy about it, do you?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Niki frown %}
Mm~ To be honest, I’ve got no interest in this.

Just the thought of a dance workshop makes my stomach growl with hunger.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Ibara yare %}
*Sigh…* Well, I did expect you to say something like that.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Ibara smilesoft %}
Rest assured; I have prepared a reward for you.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Niki curious %}
Reward…?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Ibara %}
Yes. If you participate in the workshop, I’ll give you this meal voucher that can be used in any restaurant across the country.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Niki nod %}
M-Meal voucher…!? I want it! Gimme!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Ibara %}
Now now, I’m not handing it out for free. ♪

Shiina-shi, you promise to participate in the workshop, yes?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Niki nod %}
I promise! I swear to this meal voucher that I will do my best…! ☆

    <p>A few days later. On the day of the workshop…</p>
</div>

{% bubble Niki %}
Meal voucher\~♪ Free food\~♪ Hmhmhm…♪ *<th>(Humming)</th>*
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki %}
Mm? I didn’t know you’d join as well, Shiina.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Niki %}
Oh! Why, if it isn’t Morisawa-kun~!

I had no idea someone I knew was here, so I’m happy to see ya.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki %}
Me too. I was under the impression that mostly newcomer idols would be participating in this workshop.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Niki %}
Same here! I was a li’l worried I’d stand out in a bad way.

But since Morisawa-kun’s here, I feel relieved! It’s much more reassuring with the two of us together!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki grin2 %}
Yeah! Let’s motivate each other, and work hard to improve ourselves…☆
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Niki %}
Mhm! …Ah, the dance instructor is here.

It’s time we start~ I’m gonna do my absolute best!
{% endbubble %}

<div class="msr-narration">
    <p>Two hours later. The workshop ends, and self-training begins…</p>
</div>

{% bubble Niki worried %}
You’re so mean, Morisawa-kun~!

I thought your skills were on my level, but all along, you were actually super duper good!?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki awkward %}
I’m sorry. I thought you also had decided to join the workshop in hopes of improving your skills even further…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Niki northinking %}
Oh yeah, didn’t you learn the choreography for √AtoZ real quickly, and then taught it to the rest of us?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Niki sigh2 %}
If I had kept that in mind, I wouldn’t have gotten the wrong impression of you… but I completely forgot about that ‘til now!

Uuu, it’s all my fault, but I still feel like I got left behind by my teammate in a marathon, who said we’d reach the goal together…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki worried %}
Shiina…

I really am so sorry. As an apology, could I help you with your self-training?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Niki idle %}
Eh? Nah, it’s my own fault for not double-checking things.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki idle %}
No, I won’t be able to rest with just that.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki grin2 %}
I could gain new insight by teaching you. So please let me help you!
{% endbubble %}

<div class="msr-narration">
    <p>One hour later…</p>
</div>

{% bubble Niki grin %}
1, 2, 3~♪ …And turn right here! ☆

Didja see that, Morisawa-kun!? I did it exactly how you taught me!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki grin2 %}
You’re incredible, Shiina! You’re definitely improving at an impressive rate!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Niki %}
Nahaha! It’s all thanks to you, Morisawa-kun. Thanks a lot for being patient and helping me out…☆
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Niki awkward %}
Actually… You basically helped me out ‘til it’s time to leave the dance room, even though there’s no reward for doing so… I’m real sorry for taking up your time.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki grin2 %}
Don’t sweat it. A hero always helps someone in need, without hesitation. Deserting you when you’re in trouble would go entirely against my form of justice.

Besides, I <em>did</em> get rewarded for this. I got to support you in your growth and improvement. That sense of accomplishment is a joy nothing can replace…☆
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Niki northinking %}
Justice, huh~… Aight then, I’ll also follow my own form of justice.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki curious %}
Your form of justice…?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Niki %}
Heh-heh-heh… I’ve got a meal voucher with me here! As thanks for coaching me today, I’ll treat ya to dinner~♪

A meal after a long session of dancing is the most amazing feeling *ever!* And you gotta have fun with life. That’s my form of justice…☆
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki grin2 %}
I see. It’s just like you to have that mindset, Shiina.

Alright then! Let’s enjoy a meal together tonight, in celebration of your growth!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Niki grin %}
Nahaha, I’m drooling by the very thought of what we could eat~♪

C’mon now! Let’s head over there before I drop from hunger…☆
