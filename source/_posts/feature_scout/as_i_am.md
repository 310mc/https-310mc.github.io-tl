## Chapter 1

<div class="msr-season winter">
    <p><span><b>Season:</b> Winter</span></p>
</div>

{% img /img/es/idolstory/asiam/1.jpg %}

{% bubble Tetora srsthinking %}
Mm\~, mm\~…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Hinata curious %}
Oh, ohh…? Why’re you staring at your phone? It’s really unusual for you to not gobble up tasty food as soon as you can, Tetsu-kun.

Isn’t galbi the meal of the day today, after it beautifully returned in response to your passionate love call?

You kept requesting the school cafeteria to bring it back ‘cause you so badly wanted to eat it again, so I thought you’d be super happy to see it again…?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora nod2 %}
‘Course I’m happy to see it back! I was grieving for so long after it disappeared from the menu, like, why would they even do that!?

So I’m super happy to see the galbi lunch meal resurface again!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora sighfrown %}
I really am, but… Mm~…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Hinata awkward %}
Uh-oh, he’s back to going in deep thought.

Hellooo\~? Your food’s gonna get cold at this rate. If you don’t want it, I’ll have it for myself\~
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora shocked %}
Owah!? This is <em>my</em> galbi!

Without the galbi, I’ll just be having rice for lunch! So please don’t!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Hinata yare %}
Tch~… I was hoping I’d get to have an extra serving for lunch… What a shame.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Hinata norsmile %}
Anyway, jokes aside… What’s weighing on your mind so much that you’d ignore your beloved galbi lunch meal?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora idle %}
…Truth is, Anzu-anego messaged me saying my Feature Live has been decided.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Hinata smilesoft %}
Oh~! That’s great news!

Now I get it. *That’s* why you were staring at your phone without taking a single bite, huh?

So what you’ve been thinking about has something to do with the Feature Live as well, right?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora norsmile %}
You got it. The Feature Live is a solo performance, right?

So I thought about it all over again… What sorta live would I wanna do as I am <em>now</em>?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Hinata curious %}
Ohh~ But I didn’t expect that you’d be worried over stuff like that.

‘Cause I thought, well, if this were the usual Tetsu-kun, he’d immediately say something like, “I want it to be a live show made for a man among men! Ossu!”

Oh, but, you’re also surprisingly delicate, aren’tcha~ Like, if you tripped over a pebble, you’d think over every possibility why that happened, yeah?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora awkward0 %}
…Man, don’t bring up an example that actually sounds like something I’d do.

At first, I also thought ‘bout making a “man among men” live show, just like you mentioned, y’know?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora sighfrown %}
But then I started thinking again ‘bout what it really means to be a “man among men”, and I’m not so sure anymore…

Like, remember when it was time for my personalized outfit?[^1]

At first, all I said is that I don’t really have any particular desires except a cool-looking outfit, right?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Hinata northinking %}
Ah\~ Yeah, you did say something like that\~

In retrospect, the fact that you said you wanted a manly outfit, but then answered that you didn’t really have anything you particularly wanted was pretty unmanly, huh.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora frustrated %}
Guh…!?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Hinata smileconfident %}
It’s like when you ask “What would you like for dinner?” and only get “anything’s good” as a response. It’s the hardest to work with.

It would’ve been much more like a man among men to confidently say “meat!” right there and then~♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora glare %}
You’re going off-topic here, Hinata-kun!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Hinata smilesoft %}
Ahaha, sorry, sorry. But you get what I mean, right?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora sad2 %}
…Well, I can’t say I don’t.

But even today, I was debating between galbi, pork fried with ginger, or pork cutlet for lunch, so it’s <em>too</em> painfully true…

Uu… I’m seriously so pathetic! I’m not manly at all!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Hinata surprised %}
Woah— I just brought up the topic as a light joke, but it’s causing a wildfire!?

C-C’mon now, Tetsu-kun, calm down.

Deciding what to eat for lunch and deciding what to do for a live show have different levels of importance. So it’s no surprise you’d be worried over your Feature Live, y’know?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Hinata smile %}
Plus, after the first answer you gave for your personalized outfit, you were then able to figure out what you wanted to do deep down, and conveyed all your requests to Anzu-san just fine, right?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora norsmile %}
Yeah, you really helped me out a bunch for that, Hinata-kun. I really appreciated it.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora idle %}
…I still don’t think my answer to her back then was wrong.

My ideal vision of myself — My cool self is still “the me that works hard and continues to grow stronger” to this day.

But if that’s the answer I go with now, wouldn’t it just be the same thing as before? Wouldn’t I be contradicting myself if I say I want that as my live show?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Hinata serious %}
Contradicting yourself where…?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora yare %}
Well, just think ‘bout it. I said that I wanna keep growing stronger, yet my answer is once again the same thing. Can you really say that I’ve grown, in that case?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Hinata northinking %}
Ah~ I think I get what you’re trying to say.

In other words, if there isn’t something that’s changed since then, then it just seems as though you haven’t grown, right?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Hinata serious %}
But I feel like you shouldn’t change the “works hard and continues to grow stronger” part of you so easily, Tetsu-kun.

If that changes, I feel like it wouldn’t be you anymore, but something else entirely.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora frown %}
Yeah! Exactly that. It’s ‘cuz I don’t wanna move away from that part of myself that I’m struggling so much.

Not to mention, I still need to think ‘bout how to approach the pamphlet, so I’m real stuck…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Hinata %}
Then wanna do <em>that</em> again?

We could get everyone’s help, like, “a meeting to think about Tetsu-kun’s Feature Live!”
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora norsmile %}
Mm~ While I’d like to ask others for help on this, for now, I’ll think ‘bout it on my own.

We can put our heads together to brainstorm after I decide what sorta live show I wanna go with.

I feel like I <em>have</em> to decide on what my ideal is first, y’know?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Hinata norsmile %}
…Alright. I gotcha.

Okay then, I’ll be waiting until you find the answer that makes you go “this is it!”

Actually, you’re free to show it to me on the day of the live show, even! As a surprise!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora fist %}
Ossu! I’m seriously indebted to you time and time again, Hinata-kun.

I’m gonna do my absolute best to show the “man among men” side of me once and for all!
{% endbubble %}

## Chapter 2

{% img /img/es/idolstory/asiam/2.jpg %}

<div class="msr-narration">
    <p>A few days later…</p>
</div>

{% bubble Tetora frownshake %}
<th>(Ack, this is bad… My time’s almost up, but I <em>still</em> haven’t thought up any good ideas~!)</th>

Uu~myu… What am I gonna do—
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble HiMERU serious %}
—How many times will HiMERU have to hear that bizarre groan of yours?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora worried %}
Uwah!? I’m so sorry, HiMERU-san.

If I’m bein’ a bother, I’ll head on outside straight away…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble HiMERU serious %}
Outside? It’s too late in the night to go out now.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora curious %}
Wait, what!? But Narukami-senpai still hasn’t come back…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble HiMERU serious %}
Narukami-san mentioned this morning that her work will have her sleeping over at a hotel tonight.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora awkward0 %}
Oh right, I think I remember her saying somethin’ like that…? Ahaha.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble HiMERU yare %}
Well, your head <em>has</em> been in the clouds since the morning.

Narukami-san said she’ll wait to discuss it until you bring it up, but HiMERU is at his limit.

Nagumo, if something is on your mind, please talk to HiMERU about it. HiMERU will assist you.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora serious %}
…That’s surprising. I didn’t expect you to offer to listen to my troubles, HiMERU-san.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble HiMERU serious %}
HiMERU won’t be able to sleep if you keep groaning all night. And it wouldn’t be right to drive you out of the room, either.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora awkward0 %}
Urk… Well, that’s true.

But this time around, I wanna figure out the right answer all on my own, so…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble HiMERU frown %}
You haven’t progressed at all by doing so, have you?

HiMERU believes that it’s pointless to keep wasting time without having found a solution.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora sighdrop %}
Guh—… You keep cuttin’ deep into my heart, HiMERU-san…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble HiMERU serious %}
HiMERU will not force you, but he believes that you need to understand that you no longer have the luxury to say something like that.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora sighfrown %}
…You’re exactly right, HiMERU-san. My time’s almost up, yet I still haven’t finalized a single idea.

I’m just bein’ stubborn at this point. And that’d only cause trouble to Anzu-anego, wouldn’t it?

Aight, I give in… HiMERU-san, couldja hear me out a li’l, please?
{% endbubble %}

<div class="msr-narration">
    <p>Time passes…</p>
</div>

{% bubble HiMERU serious %}
—Hm. HiMERU understands in full detail now.

So you say you’re unable to decide how to approach your Feature Live?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora idle %}
When Anego was making my personalized outfit, I asked for somethin’ a bit mature, somethin’ that looks a li’l too big on me.

I went with that ‘cuz I wanted it to be an embodiment of my feelings of wanting to put effort into growing stronger, and wanting to grow ‘til I become a version of myself that matches the outfit.

That’s still how I feel to this day. I wanna show my fans who I am as I continue to work hard and grow even more.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora sad2 %}
But… I feel like I can’t say I’ve <em>grown</em> if my answer is the exact same as before…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble HiMERU serious %}
—And what’s wrong with keeping it that way?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora shocked %}
Huh? Are you seriously saying that…!?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble HiMERU serious %}
In fact, you should express that answer as thoroughly as possible. Especially if that’s truly what you would say is your ideal.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora curious %}
Express it as thoroughly as possible…? But how?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble HiMERU smilesoft2 %}
There is no need to overthink it. You simply need to show yourself as you are.

You do your best to move forward, even if it takes all your strength to do so. You expend all your energy and efforts in order to attain your ideal.

That is the cool version of yourself that you’d like to show your fans, yes?

—Then, instead of pushing yourself to fit a bigger outfit, all you need to do is captivate your fans with your authentic self.

On top of that, you will have candid photos taken of yourself for the Feature Live’s pamphlet.

Thus, wouldn’t this approach coincide with the concept of the project?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora srsthinking %}
Huh, I see. I didn’t think of that before, actually…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble HiMERU serious %}
I’m letting you know now: do not think for a second that you would simply be relying on HiMERU’s idea here.

If you weren’t someone with great ambition to improve yourself, HiMERU wouldn’t suggest such an idea, either.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora norsmile %}
…Does that mean this is how you think of me, HiMERU-san?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble HiMERU serious %}
While it’s only been for a short while so far, we do share the same room.

HiMERU has caught glimpses of you working hard day after day whether he likes it or not.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora idle %}
Whether you like it or not…? You’re wording it in a strange way again…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble HiMERU yare %}
You sometimes exercise with a hand grip underneath your futon, no?

You may not know this, but HiMERU can clearly hear the clicking sound. Were you not aware of this?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora awkward0 %}
A-Ahaha… I’ll be more careful from now on.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble HiMERU norsmile %}
HiMERU doesn’t mind. You are always improving yourself as an idol, Nagumo. HiMERU also holds a great impression towards such an attitude.

Right, it is time HiMERU sleeps. You mustn’t overdo it either, Nagumo.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora smilesoft %}
Gotcha! Thank you so much for hearing me out!

<th>(Presenting myself as I am… as my authentic self, huh?)</th>

Okay! I’ll compile my ideas and message Anego straight away!
{% endbubble %}

{% img /img/es/idolstory/asiam/3.jpg %}

{% bubble Tetora grin %}
Ah! Heeey, over here! Anzu-anego! You showed up~! *<th>(waves)</th>*

Please wait a moment! I’ll come to you straight away!

*Huff… Huff…* Sorry to keep ya waitin’, Anego. I apologize for calling you over so early in the morning.

…I’m sorry, Anego. Could I drink a li’l bit of water first?
{% endbubble %}

<video controls>
  <source src="/img/es/idolstory/asiam/video.mp4" type="video/mp4">
</video>

{% bubble Tetora grin %}
Thank you. I got so thirsty after running as hard as I can so early in the morning…

Whew\~… I feel alive again! Cold water always feels great\~!

Ahaha. I was in a good mood, so I put my all in my morning training!

Have you been keeping yourself hydrated too, Anego?

Please feel free to drink water if you’re feelin’ thirsty.

I’m feelin’ hydrated enough, so I’m back to full energy! I can run a few more laps now!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora smileconfident %}
Oh, wait. Before I go for a run, I should tell you why I called for you here.

Did I decide what sorta live show I want? Ahaha, you can see right through me no matter what, huh?

For my Feature Live, I wanna captivate my fans by showing ‘em myself as I am.

I’m always doin’ my absolute best in order to become a man among men.

So for the pamphlet, I wanna focus on how I look whenever I’m doin’ my daily efforts to better myself.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora norsmile %}
Personally, I think that someone who pours all their effort into somethin’ is really cool.

That’s why I want my fans to think the same while seein’ me work hard.

Actually… I wanna <em>become</em> an idol that makes all my fans think of me that way.

That’s the sorta idea I’ve come up with, but… Is it okay?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora surprised %}
“Then let’s start taking photos immediately” — Wait, you’ve already got your camera with you, Anego!?

I called you here early in the morning ‘cuz I wanted to share with you my vision for the pamphlet, but I wasn’t planning on doin’ the photoshoot just yet.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora nod %}
Then again, going ‘bout it in an unexpected way should get us a better photo of my usual self~♪

Aight, I gotcha! It’s time to show what it means to be a man! Becomin’ a man among men’s still a distant dream for me, after all~
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora smilesoft %}
But you know, talking to you on the running grounds reminds me of the Sports Festival a li’l.[^2]

That really takes me back~ I still remember when we did the three-legged race together.

Hehe! How about you and I go for a run together like we did back then, Anego?

Ahaha, I’m just joking. I meant it more like a metaphor.

Anzu-anego… I’m still far from my ideal self.

I still don’t feel like I’ve become great enough to confidently say that I’m a man among men.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora fist %}
That’s exactly why, ‘til the day I build that confidence… I’m gonna keep working to the best of my ability.

I just wanted to ask you to keep watching over me as much as you can, while I try to reach my ideal.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora grin %}
“I’ve always been watching over you”…? Haha, you’re so reassuring, Anego~ Thank you so much, really.

Aight then, Anzu-anego. I’m all yours for the photoshooting, we can start anytime!
