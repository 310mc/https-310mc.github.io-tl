{% bubble Chiaki %}
Ohh, Shino-kun! Hello there!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Hajime %}
Ah, hello. Fancy seeing you here. Do you need to research something?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki %}
Oh, don’t mind me. I have a feeling I’ll be sleeping early tonight, so I just came to find a book to read in bed.

I’m glad we have this library here! I’m so happy I can easily borrow books whenever I want…☆
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Hajime %}
Heheh, I know what you mean. I always find myself coming to the library.

What kind of books do you usually read, Morisawa-senpai?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki %}
I read anything that sparks my interest! But lately, I’ve been too busy to read as much as I used to. I didn’t even decide on what kind of book I wanted to borrow before coming here.

Do you happen to have any recommendations?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Hajime %}
Hmm… I could’ve recommended something to you if you had a favorite author, but since you don’t mind anything… Hmmm~…

Oh, I know! How about you take a look at the best-selling books? The members of Biblion compiled all the popular books and placed them into their own special corner over there.

They’re organized into different categories, like new releases, book collections, or literature— I’m sure you’ll be able to find something you like~♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki %}
Ohh, that’s wonderful! I’ll go take a look right now. Thank you, Shino-kun!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Hajime %}
You’re welcome. Feel free to ask me for help anytime.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki %}
<th>(…Hmm, so these are the best-selling books, huh… Yeah, they’ve compiled a lot of books you’d find in commercials and advertisements.)</th>

<th>(“Drama adaptation coming soon”… Could this be the source material for the show Kiryu’s currently filming?)</th>

<th>(I’m pretty curious, but mystery shows are more immersive when you don’t know how the storyline en—hm?)</th>

<th>(There’s a strange book here… It's got a pitch-black leather cover — it looks expensive. And is this pattern on the front cover a magic circle…?)</th>

Mmrm, this doesn’t seem right… What on earth is this book?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Hajime %}
Did something happen, Morisawa-senpai?

Waah… That book looks like something you’d see in a fantasy world, doesn’t it? It’s quite thick, though… Is it some sort of manual, I wonder?

I’ve never seen a book like this before.

…Ah, that reminds me—
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki %}
Did something come to mind?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Hajime %}
Ah, no, it reminded me of the horror movie I watched last month.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki %}
*Horror* movie…?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Hajime %}
Yes, a bunch of the idols here decided to watch a horror movie together in the common room — we wanted to fight off the summer heat by giving ourselves some chills.

The movie was about people getting cursed from watching a video with no title.

It’s known to be a very Japanese-style horror movie; just as you'd expect, it kept you on the edge of your seat from start to finish.

One of the scariest scenes was when the ghost slowly creeped out of the TV. We all screamed really loudly—

Loud enough to make other people worry that something happened.

And that’s how we ended up with a lot of people watching the movie together~♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki %}
W-Wow, I didn’t know you had a movie session like that…

<th>(I’m *really* glad I wasn’t there for it. I wouldn’t have been able to sleep…)</th>
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Hajime %}
I wonder if we’ll get cursed from this book, just like that untitled video…

Just kidding! That could never happen in real life, right? Let me try opening it; I’m curious about its contents.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki %}
N-No, don’t be hasty! We don’t even know what’s written inside, y’know!?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Hajime %}
Um, yes…? That’s why I’d like to check—
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki %}
It’s dangerous to act rashly! Notice how suspicious the pattern looks— What if it *is* a demonic book made to curse anyone who reads it!? We need to think about this more thoroughly!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Hajime %}
But we don’t know what the book is about, so it’ll remain a mystery no matter how much we think it through.

I think the best choice is to find out what kind of book it is and attach a note to it.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tsumugi %}
Oh gosh, I’m in trouble… I just hope nobody took the book with them…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki %}
Ohh…! I was wondering who that was— You seem to be in a rush, Aoba. Did something happen?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tsumugi %}
You see, I’m looking for somethi—

Ah! That’s the one!

Did you look inside!? Surely you didn’t, right…?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Hajime %}
N-No. We didn't even look at the first page.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tsumugi %}
Really!? I-I’m sooo glad~…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki %}
What do you mean by tha—Ah!? So it really *was* a cursed book!?

I knew it! Opening it would only bring calamity to the world! The gates of hell would open — the “S” in ES would stand for satan instead of square![^1]

I do believe justice would prevail, and love would definitely save the world! But could I really put an end to a demon’s rampage with my love alone!?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Hajime %}
Umm, senpai…?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tsumugi %}
Ummm… Don’t worry, Chiaki-kun. This is actually a notebook for live show production ideas.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki %}
A notebook…?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tsumugi %}
Yes. It would be dull to keep our ideas in a normal notebook, so we’ve been writing them down in a mysterious, magical-looking book to keep in line with Switch’s theme.

I placed it in the bookshelf when I was organizing the books here, but I accidentally ended up piling it up with the rest of the books.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Hajime %}
Ahhh, now I understand. Okay then, here’s your notebook back.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tsumugi %}
Thank you. I’m so grateful you didn’t open it~
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki %}
S-So *that’s* what it was… And here I thought it was a cursed book…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tsumugi %}
Heheh, you aren’t completely wrong, though. Natsume-kun might have put a curse on you if you ended up reading it.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki %}
T-That’s not a joke I can laugh at…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Hajime %}
In the end, cursed videos and books can’t actually exist. After all, we would be in a lot of trouble if the world could get flipped on its head just by someone opening a book.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tsumugi %}
I don’t think we can be completely sure of that, y’know? Take a look over here. To tell you the truth—
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki %}
Whaaat!? So there *are* cursed books!?

I thankfully found a book to read, so I’ll be taking my leave! Farewell!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tsumugi %}
There’s a book all about curses, you see— Ah, Chiaki-kun left?

I wanted to show it to him since he sounded worried, but oh well. I’ll tell you about it instead, Hajime-kun.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Hajime %}
Thank you. I’ll tell Morisawa-senpai about it later.
{% endbubble %}
