<th>(Here we are at the training room! I'mma get back to the usual workout grind~!)</th>

<th>(Mm, someone's here before me? I see him right by the workout machines…)</th>

Hello, Sazanami-senpai! Thanks for all your hard work!
{% endbubble %}

{% img /img/es/idolstory/bodybuildingbros/2.jpg %}

{% bubble Jun v2 %}
Oh? You're… Nagumo-kun from Ryuseitai, right? Looks like you're hard at it ♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora v2 %}
Woah, to think a member of Eden knows my name… Makes me real happy! Are you taking a break right now?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Jun v2 %}
Well, kinda. Nagumo-kun, you work out here pretty often too, don't ya?

I haven't gotten a chance to chat with you 'til now, but I'd been wanting to after seeing you in here every now and then. I mean, it seems like you train a whole lot…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora v2 %}
Really!? To be honest, I've also been super curious about your abs! You got to show ‘em off in the workout feature for that health and fitness magazine, right?

I'm always sure to buy it whenever it features something about workouts, and my jaw was on the *floor* at how jacked you were in all your photos!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Jun v2 %}
That so~? I'm glad to hear it ♪ When I heard I'd be on the cover, I revised my whole training routine to focus on my abs and stuff, up 'til the shoot…♪

Which area are ya focusing on right now, Nagumo-kun?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora v2 %}
Hm, good question… Thing is, I'm tryna figure out what's the best area to build up if I wanna get stronger.

I do karate, and just got my blackbelt the other day… but training to get it really made me have a hard think on what it takes to seriously build yourself.

I tried to pinpoint exactly what could help me power myself up a notch, so now I just wanna focus as much as I can on making those key points of my body stronger!

I’m no good at using my brain, but I'm sure my body beefin' up'll tell me just how well I did! 'Cuz like, I can see just how much I've grown through all my training and matches~♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Jun v2 %}
Oh, I totally getcha. Nothing beats getting to see all your gains, huh~?

That's why *I* like working out. At first it was kinda just something forced onto me, but as it grew into a habit, I guess I really started to enjoy it.

I've stuck to it to the point that nowadays I'll feel like shit if I skip a day.

Well, even without that keeping me going, I'd just fall behind everyone if I don't continue training. I'll keep up the grind from here on out~
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora v2 %}
Yeah, right!? You can’t get buff in a day, after all! For real, I totally getcha…!
{% endbubble %}

{% img /img/es/idolstory/bodybuildingbros/3.jpg %}

{% bubble Jun v2 %}
But y'know, I end up with folks complaining sometimes 'bout all the training I do.

They'll go on about how much I stink of sweat, or that I should worry 'bout my clothes not fitting me, or how it's not beautiful to be so buff…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora v2 %}
Ooh, just looking at your face tells me you've gone through a whole lot. What d'you do when that happens?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Jun v2 %}
If I feel like I've gotten *too* buff and I'm starting to slow down 'cause of it, I'll ease up a lil'. Like last summer, for example — I cut down a *lot* on exercise, y’know~
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora v2 %}
On that note… What do you do when someone says you stink of sweat?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Jun v2 %}
Hmm, well… Back when I lived with Ohii-san in the Reimei dorms, I mostly waved it off, really.

But after moving to Starmony Dorm, my roomie's never really complained… So now I actually *do* try to be considerate and make sure to shower and all?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora v2 %}
Ah, so I really *should* do that… I mean, I could never just “wave it off” myself, so…!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Jun v2 %}
…Nagumo-kun, have you gotten told off for smelling like sweat, too?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora v2 %}
Erm, not yet. But since my roommates tend to spray perfume on themselves…

It feels a lil' wrong to be working out in our dorm. I'd feel bad stinking up the place with my sweat, so I’m tryna figure out what to do about it.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Jun v2 %}
Makes sense~ That's the tricky part of sharing a room, huh? Well, my two cents is that the best thing to do is to make sure you shower after every session.

As for what else you can do… You could use this training room or go for a jog 'round ES. I mean, you can always train somewhere outside your room, right~?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora v2 %}
Ah, so I *wasn’t* far off the mark! Y’see, they told me not to worry about working out in our room, so I couldn't really ask 'em what the best choice was…

That’s why I’m real glad I can talk to you about all this, Sazanami-senpai!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Jun v2 %}
Right back at ya. I never get the chance to really chat 'bout working out like this, so I'm glad, too. In my opinion, training's pretty awesome.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora v2 %}
You know it! It’s too bad no one else really gets how we feel about it, though. Like, my teammate Midori-kun *always* makes a face at me when I invite him over to work out.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Jun v2 %}
Speaking of Takamine-kun… He gave me some broccoli just the other day.[^1] Seeing him suddenly whip some veggies outta his bag was a serious surprise, I tell ya.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora v2 %}
Oh yeah, that stuff’s good for building muscle! He also gives some to me pretty often~♪ Sometimes even avocados and stuff, too!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Jun v2 %}
Ooh, speaking of avocados, I think they're on today's canteen menu—

…Hang on, sorry if I've been kinda pushy with chatting. I bet I’m getting in the way of your training, aren’t I?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora v2 %}
Nah, not at all! If anything, *I'm* sorry for getting so caught up in our conversation!

But man, talking with you is reminding me all over again why working out's so awesome. On top of building my muscles, I get to be inspired by my seniors as well as so much else!
{% endbubble %}

{% img /img/es/idolstory/bodybuildingbros/4.jpg %}

{% bubble Jun v2 %}
Haha. All thanks to working out — or you could even say we got to bond through our muscles, right~? Working out is seriously *so* rewarding ♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora v2 %}
Yeah, we owe this bonding session all to exercise…♪
{% endbubble %}

<th>(H-Huuuh…!? Just *how* did you two end up at this kinda conclusion…?)</th>

<th>(I got curious when I heard my name and listened in, but this convo's got me totally lost…)</th>

<th>(The hell does “bond through our muscles” even *mean*? Nothing makes sense in the slightest… The only thing I understand is that Tetora-kun ditched me to get to know an *extrovert*…)</th>

<th>(Ughhh… Now I don’t want him getting any more buff than he already is. From now on he's not getting any broccoli or avocado from *me*…!)</th>
