<th>(If I remember correctly, the members of Biblion are gathering in the library today, so us at the Manga Club are meeting in the theatre room instead.)</th>

<th>(And since we’re gonna be in the theatre room, we decided to watch adaptations of manga together, but… Nobody’s here yet, huh…)</th>

<th>(I can’t just start watching on my own, though, so what now…)</th>

<th>(I did bring some manga with me from my room, so I guess I’ll read a bit until someone else arrives.)</th>

It’s nice to re-read a manga series from the first volume every once in a while…♪
{% endbubble %}

<div class="msr-narration">
    <p>Thirty minutes later…</p>
</div>

{% bubble Midori %}
<th>(I know we all have work, but I didn’t expect to be the <em>only</em> <em>one</em> to show up…)</th>

<th>(It feels wasteful to be taking this space up for myself… There’s all sorts of things you could do here, but I’m just reading a manga instead…)</th>

Now I’m starting to feel bad about how I’m using this room… I hope someone comes soon…
{% endbubble %}

<div class="msr-narration">
    <p>Door knocking</p>
</div>

{% bubble Midori %}
…? Coming~
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Jun v3 %}
Hey, it's good to see you. Sorry I'm a lil' late.

Are you the only one here so far, Takamine-kun? I guess I didn't need to bring all these drinks then, huh?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
Hello, it’s nice to see you, too. Erm, I’m really sorry for not being more thoughtful… It didn’t even occur to me to bring drinks…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Jun v3 %}
Haha, don't worry 'bout it~

I mean, I don't have much manga of my own, so I'm always reading what everyone else brings, yeah?

That's why I take it upon myself to at least do this much. You could say it's something like, “he who does not work shall not read”, I guess?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
Uu… You’re so admirable, Sazanami-senpai, it’s too blinding…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Jun v3 %}
I'm just used to doing stuff for others like this. What wouldja like to drink, Takamine-kun?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
Ah, it’s fine. I’ll pour it for myself…

I know this can barely act as repayment, but I brought over a few manga with me, so feel free to read any if you’d like.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Jun v3 %}
Thanks a bunch. I think we’ve got pretty similar tastes in manga, so I'm always excited to read everything you recommend me~♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
O-Oh, I see… I’ll keep the next volume on the table, so please go ahead and read it…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble MidoriJun %}
…… *<th>(Indulging themselves in reading whatever they like.)</th>*
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
<th>(Oh yeah, the next volume of this manga series is going to come out soon…)</th>

I should go to the bookstore sometime…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Jun v3 %}
Is there something you wanna buy?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
Huh?

Sorry, that was just me talking to myself… It’s almost time for this manga’s new volume release, so I was thinking I should head to the bookstore sometime soon.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Jun v3 %}
Oh, really? When's it gonna be out for sale?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
Ah, no, I don’t know the details… I just figured it’ll be released soon enough.

Maybe they already announced an estimated date…? Let me check.

………
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Jun v3 %}
What's up?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
I’m looking through a site that lists all the new releases, but there’s so many that I can’t find it…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Jun v3 %}
Ah~ I check that site every now and then, too. Really throws you for a loop seeing how many of those releases are just manga, huh~?

But it sure is fun to spot titles and even authors you recognise while going through the list of ‘em.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
I kind of get what you mean. When I spot a manga I’ve been hearing about in the new releases, I’m like, “Woah, it’s finally happening”…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Jun v3 %}
Yeah, like that one you just scrolled past. It was a real hit everywhere just a lil' while ago, right?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
Where? Is it up here…?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Jun v3 %}
Nah, it's right there under your finger —
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble MidoriJun %}
Oww!?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
\~\~…! *<th>(Speechless)</th>*
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Jun v3 %}
You alright!? Sorry, I meant to get a better look at the screen but wound up bumping into ya…!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
I-I think I’m alright. Everything turned white for a moment…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Jun v3 %}
It's my fault for having such a hard head… Sorry 'bout that. If only I'd just used my own phone…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
No… It’s not your fault; it’s more to do with the size of my phone screen…  The site’s font might be too small, as well…

Maybe if we were looking from a bigger screen, like a tablet or a laptop…

Well, we’ve got a screen right here in this room, though…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Jun v3 %}
Ooh, that's a good idea ♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
…?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Jun v3 %}
Y'see, I just remembered what Ibara's done before with a screen — He connected his phone to the projector and all.

Since we should have everything we need in this room for it, we could also give it a shot, yeah?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
Ahh, I get it… I never considered using my phone like that.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Jun v3 %}
Well, not that I've tried it myself yet. How exactly did he do this again…?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
<th>(I found the adaptor and cable on the shelf… Is this all I need to set it up?)</th>

<th>(I’ll try to attach it to a compatible port. I have to plug this part into my phone, and then connect the cable to the projector…)</th>

Woah, it’s showing up on the screen…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Jun v3 %}
Hey, you got it working. Looks like getting everything connected was easier than I thought~♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
Now the text is big enough for lots of people to read together…♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Jun v3 %}
The series I was talking 'bout is at the very top of the screen, see~ With the text this big, it's easier to read, too. Nice ♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
<th>(Huh, a screen this size would make it so much easier to read manga with lots of text or written in small font.)</th>

<th>(Well, in those cases, you could just buy the digital version so you can freely zoom in on the pages—)</th>

…Ahh, I see.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Jun v3 %}
? Didja remember something, too?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
Well, I’m thinking of opening an ebook on the screen…

Instead of borrowing and lending manga all the time, then waiting until someone finishes reading the manga you also wanna read… Maybe it’s possible to read it together by projecting on the screen…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Jun v3 %}
Reading it on the big screen… I'd never have thought of that, Takamine-kun.

So this is your digital library, huh? You sure do read a lot…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
I always buy a few whenever I’ve got coupons, so my list just naturally ended up being this long…

I don’t have that much space for my personal belongings in my dorm room, but I don’t have to worry about that if I buy the ebook instead, so…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Jun v3 %}
Well, nothing wrong with that. Seeing your library on the big screen makes me really admire it, y'know~?

I never really had a habit of collecting manga myself — but with ebooks, maybe even I could try building my own collection, too… ♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
<th>(Sazanami-senpai seems kinda cheerful now…? I don’t really get it, but if it made him happy, I’m sorta glad…)</th>

Nobody’s coming, huh… Is everyone busy…?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Jun v3 %}
Well, we can just take our time while waiting for 'em. I mean, our circle is pretty chill with how we spend our time to begin with, right?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
Hm… Then, would you like to read something together from my library? You can pick something you like, Sazanami-senpai.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Jun v3 %}
Can I really? Man, you've got so many titles I've been wanting to check out that I'm having trouble deciding~
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
Well, there’s an interesting manga I read recently—…
