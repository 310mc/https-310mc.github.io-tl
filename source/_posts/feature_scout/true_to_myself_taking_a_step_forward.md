## Chapter 1

{% note narration %}
**Translator’s Note:** This story title references Midori’s first feature scout: <a href="/staying_true_to_myself" target="_blank"><b>True To Myself, Staying The Way I Am</b>.</a>
<br>Originally, I translated the FS1 title differently, but to make the reference between the two FS stories clearer, I’ve adjusted the title.
<br>Please enjoy Midori’s FS2 story: <b>True To Myself, Taking A Step Forward.</b>

{% bubble Midori curious %}
Ah, Anzu-san. Hello, I hope you’re doing well… I’m so sorry for making you wait.

…So, what did you want to speak to me about?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori sighdrop %}
Ah, so it really <em>is</em> about the Feature Live… It’s my turn now, huh…

I seem reluctant to do it…?

No, it’s more like… Knowing that I’ll be performing on a stage all by myself makes me kind of anxious…

I mean, it’s true that I’m getting more individual work lately…

But my solo work is, like… The modeling jobs are mainly just photoshoots, so… I can do the bare minimum with conversations there…

Whereas, when it comes to solo performances like the Feature Live… I’d have to do the MC talk all on my own too, right?

The thought of me doing everything all by myself makes me depressed…

And I don’t have any ideas for the stage, either…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori awkward %}
I’m really sorry. I don’t mean to trouble you, Anzu-san…

…I guess I shouldn’t be saying that though, when I’m troubling you right this second…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori sighfrown %}
I know that the Feature Live is an important job, too. Everyone has to do it once it’s their turn, and it just so happens to be mine now.

So I’m really sorry to be the only one who’s being negative about it.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori curious %}
…Huh? You’d like me to at least check the plan details?

If that’s all I have to do, then… Okay, sure.

Ah, there isn’t only one plan here. …Does that mean you’ve already thought up a bunch of different ideas for me?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori frown %}
<th>(Anzu-san is doing this much for my sake, and I’d like to meet her where she’s at too, but…)</th>

<th>(Mm, no. Let me just focus on reading the plan details for now. I might find something I’d like to do through them.)</th>

This is… a performance stage based on yuruchara?[^1]

<th>(Oh yeah, didn’t I get to participate in an event that had yuruchara in it a while back…?)</th>[^2]

<th>(I was on edge about possibly being next for the personalized outfit back then, too…)</th>
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori norsmile %}
Um, and this other plan will have a nature-based setting? …The motif is based on plants, huh?

Ah, is it because my home is a greengrocer business? Or did you get the idea from how I’m Ryusei Green…?

…Mm? Anzu-san, did you accidentally mix someone else’s plan with mine? I’m talking about this next one, with the cool-looking stage…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori surprised %}
Huh!? This is one of your ideas for my stage, too!?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori worried %}
N-No, I can’t do something like this…! I don’t think it’d suit me *at all!*

That’s not true? No, but still, this is a little…

…Right. I’m so sorry to say this after you came up with it for my sake, but I’d be glad if you could drop that idea…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori sad2 %}
<th>(…Why would Anzu-san bring a plan like <em>this</em> to me…?)</th>

<th>(Is it ‘cause I do a lot of modeling work? I mean, yeah, I do sometimes wear these kinda outfits for my photoshoots…)</th>

<th>(But I don’t think I could ever perform a whole live show in something so cool-looking.)</th>

Huh? Is there a kind of stage that I’d like to do?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori frown %}
Mm~… I like the yuruchara plan, but knowing myself, I’d probably end up making the yuruchara the main focus instead…

This is meant to be my solo live, though, so I should probably avoid that sort of concept.

On the other hand, I might end up feeling so relaxed on the plant-based stage, that I don’t actually bother to put my all…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori shocked %}
Ah—… I’m so sorry… After everything you did for me…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori srsthinking %}
…………

Um, I’ll also think up something from my side. Could you give me a little bit of time?

You went through so much trouble preparing for me, so I want to bring something to the table, too…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori smile %}
I still have time, you say, so it’s okay? Whew, I’m glad to hear that…♪

Okay then, I’ll think about what to do with my solo live until our next meeting.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori awkward %}
…But please don’t expect much from me, okay?

Mom, I’ll put the daikons here, okay?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori sightired %}
…*Sigh.*

<th>(I’ve thought about all sorts of things for my Feature Live since then, but I can’t come up with any solid ideas…)</th>

<th>(What am I gonna do… Today’s when I have another meeting with Anzu-san…)</th>

<th>(When it was my turn to get my personalized outfit, I got lucky with figuring out what sorta outfit I wanna wear… But this time around, I <em>seriously</em> can’t think of anything…)</th>
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori sad2 %}
<th>(Actually, it’s more like… Before I even get to finding out <em>what</em> I wanna do… I start to feel unsettled over the thought of me, in the near future, performing a solo live…)</th>

<th>(Like, I can’t even imagine myself accomplishing that all on my own…)</th>

Huh? What is it, Mom?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori awkward %}
…Ahh, no, I’m okay. I was just thinking about something…

<th>(Ugh, this *sucks.* I’ve been moping about this so much that people keep getting worried over me…)</th>
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori smileconfident %}
<th>(Ah— But it made me really happy when Shinkai-senpai gave me Kanatee merch as encouragement…♪)</th>[^3]
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori frown %}
<th>(Wait, no, this isn’t the time to let my thoughts wander. I have to think up something <em>now</em>, or I’ll be showing up empty-handed to my meeting with Anzu-san.)</th>

<th>(She’s patiently waiting for me to come up with something… She might get disappointed at this rate, won’t she…)</th>
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori sad4 %}
<th>(But it’d also be awful to make her wait even longer, when I don’t even have any ideas right now…)</th>

<th>(Maybe I really should just—…)</th>

*<th>(whispering)</th>* …turn down the Feature Live, huh…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mitsuru curious %}
Turn down what now?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori surprised %}
Woah!? …Tenma-kun?

Don’t do that… You really surprised me.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mitsuru %}
Sorry about that! But I was here for a while now, y’know?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori awkward %}
Oh, I had no idea… Um, welcome, I think? You came here to buy something, right?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mitsuru %}
Nope! I’ve got something for you, Midori-chan!

You seem down lately, so I’ve been worried about you!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori frownshake %}
Ah… Sorry. I was looking depressed even in our dorm room, wasn’t I…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mitsuru %}
Mhm. Ao-chan-senpai was worried too, and I bet Saegusa-senpai feels the same way!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori worried0 %}
That might be true for Aoba-senpai, but I dunno about Saegusa-senpai… I feel like he’d just think it’s irritating…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mitsuru fist %}
No way! Everyone would obviously be way more happy to see you glad than sad, Midori-chan!

That’s why we’ll do super fun things together!

I came up with the perfect strategy plan for that! All for you, Midori-chan!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori curious %}
Um… Strategy plan?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mitsuru grin %}
It’s Operation: “Buying sweets at the candy store together”! ☆

Once you eat lots and lots of tasty sweets, all your worries will be blown away!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori awkward %}
Um, no, sweets won’t be enough to do that…

But thanks, I appreciate the thought.

I’d hate to make everyone feel down ‘cause of my moping…

So as long as everyone stays cheerful and energetic like you, Tenma-kun, it’ll put me at ease.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mitsuru %}
…? I’m glad to know that I helped!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori worried0 %}
But the thing is, I’m helping out at the store right now, so I can’t go buy sweets with you. Sorry.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mitsuru %}
Huh? But Midori-chan’s mom is saying it’s fine to go, y’know?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori shocked %}
Wait, Mom? But what about helping out—…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mitsuru nod %}
Didja hear that! Midori-chan’s mom agrees that taking breaks is important! ☆ Time to dash-dash to the candy store~!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori worried0 %}
D-Don’t push my back… Okay, okay… I’ll go.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mitsuru blushjoy %}
Yaaay! I get to go with Midori-chan to the candy store~☆

We’re at the candy store\~! Oh man, I don’t even know what to buy\~!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori sightired %}
<th>(Tenma-kun’s so energetic… I’m sorry to say this, but I just don’t find this fun at all…)</th>
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori norsmile %}
Ah, Auntie…[^4] Hello, it’s been a while. I’m here to hang out.

Huh? It doesn’t feel like it’s been a while? Oh yeah, you do come to our greengrocer every once in a while, right?[^5]

That’s not what you meant? Ah, I’ve been appearing a lot on TV lately, so you’ve been seeing me often.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori awkward %}
You think I looked really cool at the live show from the other day, too? …U-Um, I see.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori frownshake %}
<th>(Auntie’s happily talking about it with me, but I never know how to respond to being told that I looked cool…)</th>

<th>(Plus, I can’t really re-watch shows I’m in, ‘cause I get so worried that I messed up somewhere.)</th>
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori surprised %}
Huh? You put up a poster of Ryuseitai in your store? …Woah, it really is right there!?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mitsuru grin %}
I see posters of Midori-chan with his unit all over the shopping district![^6] There was one in the butcher’s shop and the socks store, too!

You can really tell everyone wants to cheer for you and Ryuseitai, Midori-chan! ☆
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori awkward %}
Wait, really? I never noticed…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori frown %}
Ah, no, it’s not a bother… It’s a little embarrassing, though.

And I may appear on TV, but an idol like me is still just a rookie…

I’m trying as best as I can, but who knows when I’ll disappoint you all with a huge mistake in my performances…

So, like… I’d rather you don’t expect much from me, I guess…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori curious %}
…You’re happy enough just seeing me work hard as an idol?

Huh… really?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori smile %}
Um… Thank you, Auntie. I barely check people’s responses to the work I do, so…

It makes me feel a little better to know that there are people close to me, other than my parents, that support me…♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mitsuru nod %}
Mhm, mhm! Everyone loves seeing you work super hard as an idol, Midori-chan! ☆
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori curious %}
Huh? …The boys who came with me last time aren’t with me today…?[^7]

Do you mean Himemiya-kun and Suou-kun…?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mitsuru fist %}
Auntie, do you wanna see them? Then I’ll dash off to call them over!

It’s time to dash-dash to the Seisoukan Dorm~!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori surprised %}
Wait, Tenma-kun!? You’re gonna call them over *now!?*

Wouldn’t it be way better to talk to them by pho—
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori sightired %}
…And he’s gone. We don’t even know if they’re in the dorms…

Wasn’t this supposed to be an operation to blow away my worries? I can’t believe he’d just leave me here… This is so depressing…

Ah, no. I’m just talking to myself; you don’t have to worry, Auntie.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori smilesoft %}
Mhm. I’m here already, so I think I’ll buy a few sweets before going home…♪

Ooh, Takamine! You’re back!

What happened to Tenma-kun? Didn’t he go with you to the candy store?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori frown %}
Tenma-kun left me and ran off somewhere…

Wait, forget that for a moment. Why are you and Anzu-san at our greengrocer’s?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki smileexplain %}
I happened to bump into Anzu earlier. She said that she was on her way to visit you for a meeting, and asked if I’d like to join her.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori sighfrown %}
*Sigh.* …Anzu-san, of <em>all</em> people, why did you invite this guy…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori curious %}
Huh? Because Morisawa-senpai was worried about me?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki serious %}
Yeah. See, I heard through the grapevine that you’ve been worried over something, Takamine.

I wanted to get in touch with you, but I couldn’t find the right time to meet up and talk… And when I tried calling you, you wouldn’t pick up…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori yare %}
I’ve already got the Feature Live to worry about, I don’t have the time to deal with you too, Morisawa-senpai.

…But I apologize for making you worry.

Well, you talked to me now, so you’re satisfied, right? Now please go home.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki grin2 %}
Fuhaha! Don’t say that! It’s been a while since we’ve seen each other, so let’s talk some more, Takamine! ☆
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori frownshake %}
Uwah… It’s been a while since I felt this suffocating air… And just when I was starting to feel a little better, too…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori curious %}
But Anzu-san, you didn’t have to come all the way to the greengrocer store… Weren’t we planning to have our meeting in ES?

Ah, you came here because you wanted to buy vegetables?
{% endbubble %}

<video controls>
  <source src="/img/es/idolstory/truetomyselfstepforward/video.mp4" type="video/mp4">
</video>

{% bubble Midori smilesoft %}
Then, erm… Welcome to our store.

Today’s special is carrots? Yeah, it is.

We’ve got some fresh, smooth carrots in stock. …Here, you can see with this one~♪

I think that they’re much sweeter than the usual kind, so I really do recommend them. I’m sure that you’d enjoy them in a curry or stew.

And then… how about some daikon and Chinese cabbage, too? Cabbage stew tastes really good during this season, too.

Then we have… Ah— If there’s any specific vegetables you’d like, please let me know, okay?

I’m always indebted to you, Anzu-san, so I’ll give you a discount~♪

Alright, there you go. Thank you for purchasing…♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori surprised %}
…Huh? Have I got a clear vision of my Feature Live now?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori sightired %}
Uu— I completely forgot about that, but I got brought right back to reality…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki nod %}
Oh yeah, you’ve been thinking of an idea for the live show, right?

If there’s anything I can help with, feel free to talk to me about it!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki awkward %}
That being said, I can’t really meddle in your plans by suggesting a specific idea on the sort of stage you should have…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori frown %}
That’s exactly the part I’ve been most worried about, though…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki norsmile %}
This is your very own solo live, Takamine. I don’t believe that what your fans want to see is a stage that I think up for you.

But don’t worry. No matter how the live show turns out, as long as it’s a stage <em>you</em> thought up, it’ll surely be something incredible!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori frownshake %}
…You say it like it’s so simple, but don’t you ever think about possibly making a mistake…?

I don’t have the confidence in myself to pull off a solo live all on my own. If I slip up, wouldn’t I just end up betraying everyone’s expectations, when they came over just to see me?

I… don’t wanna disappoint my fans who’ve been supporting me.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki smilesoft %}
…It’s only natural you’d be anxious about that, Takamine.

But even then, all the people who cheer and support you…

I’m sure that they understand that you’re doing the best you possibly can to perform on stage, even though you’re feeling anxious inside.

Your courage to stand on stage and perform with all your might will definitely reach every one of them.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki smileconfident %}
Of course, the less mistakes, the better, but! The only way for us idols to avoid that is to keep practicing.

You’re the only one who’ll stand on the actual stage, but I can help you out with practice anytime, Takamine!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki awkward %}
Ah, actually— Would it be easier for you to practice with people your own age instead, like Sengoku or Nagumo…?

You’ve been pushy this whole time, so please don’t just back out all of a sudden… It throws me off.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori norsmile %}
…But, right. Morisawa-senpai has always been that sort of person.

If I keep avoiding a challenge out of fear of betraying everyone’s expectations, I’ll only get farther and farther away from a future where everyone is smiling, right?

…Anzu-san, could you please show me the plans for the Feature Live again?

I didn’t want my true self—… I didn’t want anyone to know the me that can’t do anything, because I didn’t want to disappoint them…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori smilesoft %}
But instead of avoiding even trying… I want to give becoming the cool-looking me a chance — that “me” that everyone who supports me envisions me as.

All for the sake of that future… the one where I make everyone smile by singing and dancing on stage.

## Translation Notes

[^1]: Yuruchara, <em>yuru</em> meaning “loose,” “soft,” “laid-back,” + the word “character”. <em>Yuruchara</em> are mascot characters, their defining features are that they have very peculiar designs, ranging from bizarre-cute to adorkable, as well as being used all across Japan for PR purposes, in companies, prefectures, etc… For more information please see <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/yuruchara" target="_blank">this</a>.
[^2]: Referring to his first Feature Scout Story, <a href="/staying_true_to_myself" target="_blank">True To Myself, Staying The Way I Am</a>.
[^3]: Kanatee (Kanata + Manatee pun) is Aoumi Aquarium’s mascot, and you can see how it looks in <a href="https://ensemble-stars.fandom.com/wiki/(Intertwined_Sea)_Kanata_Shinkai" target="_blank">this CG</a> and in <a href="/img/es/birthdaystory/es2/kanata/bdaycake.png" target="_blank">Kanata's birthday cake</a>.
[^4]: Midori says <em>obasan</em>, a polite way to refer to an elderly woman. It can be used for any elderly woman, regardless of family relation. It can also be translated as “Ma’am/Miss”, “Granny”, or “Old lady”.
[^5]: Midori typically speaks in polite Japanese (keigo) with people older than him, but he talks casually with the elderly woman. He speaks this way with his family, too.
[^6]: The shopping district is where Midori’s home, the greengrocer, is located.
[^7]: Referring to <a href="https://ensemble-stars.fandom.com/wiki/Little_Kings" target="_blank">Little Kings</a>.
[^8]: Chiaki speaks in polite Japanese (keigo) to Midori’s mother.
