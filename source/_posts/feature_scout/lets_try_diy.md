{% bubble Midori %}
Erm, so do I just cut it off from here?

Guh— It needs a lot of force. What now…? It’s kinda scary, but I won’t be able to cut it at all unless I put my strength into it. Alright, here goes…

Push the saw down, and pull it back as hard as possible… Woah!?

Whew, I managed to cut it off… But it happened so suddenly that it surprised me.

Huh? The cut is slanted!? *Sigh,* this is so depressing…
{% endbubble %}

{% img /img/es/idolstory/challengediy/2.jpg %}

{% bubble Tori %}
What’re you doing over there, Takamine?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
Uwaah!? Himemiya-kun and Master Artist Fushimi? That surprised me, I didn’t expect anyone to talk to me…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tori %}
Ah, sorry. I didn’t think you’d be holding a sharp object… That was dangerous; I shouldn’t have talked to you out of nowhere.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
Ahh… Don’t worry about it, it’s fine. I didn’t get injured or anything.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Yuzuru %}
Thank goodness. However, I’m surprised to see you using a saw… This may be rude of me to say, but that’s quite unexpected from you.

What were you doing with it?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
I was doing a bit of repairing, or more like, uh, what was it again… DIY?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tori %}
DIY…? What’s that?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Yuzuru %}
It means “Do It Yourself”. To put it literally, it’s to build something on your own.

It refers to repairing or building items by yourself, without the help of professionals.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tori %}
Huh, I see… Why were you doing something so bothersome, Takamine?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
You see, Shiratori-kun and Saegusa-senpai fixed my favorite footstool a while ago.[^1]

It was super worn-out, yet the two of them managed to fix it back into its cute shape as an apology for breaking it.

It really inspired me, so here we are.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Yuzuru %}
*Ibara,* doing something out of good will…? No, that’s simply impossible.

Takamine-sama, it would be best that you don’t use that footstool. We’re talking about <em>that</em> man; who knows what sort of trap he planted on it.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
Whaa…!? Huh, but there wasn’t anything weird at all on the footstool…?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tori %}
Yeah, Yuzuru. Takamine said that Shiratori repaired it with Saegusa-senpai, so don’t you think you’re overthinking it?

Besides, what would Saegusa-senpai gain out of doing that to Takamine? You’re way too cautious!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Yuzuru %}
Rather, I personally believe there is no harm in being over-cautious with his actions, but…

No, if that is what Young Master says, then I will consider it as me simply overthinking it.

However, Takamine-sama — I suggest that you check if there are any listening bugs installed on the footstool, just in case.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
Uh, okay… I don’t think I’ve got anything of value to offer for him to do that, though.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tori %}
This conversation’s gone into <em>such</em> a weird direction ‘cause of Yuzuru…

Anyway, so Takamine — You got inspired by how well the two repaired it, and it made you wanna try it too?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
Yeah, basically. I have other goods that are close to breaking, so I thought to try and fix them myself…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tori %}
And that’s why you look like you’re about to die, ‘cause you weren’t able to do it properly, huh.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
Saegusa-senpai and Shiratori-kun fixed it so cleanly, so I thought I could do it too… But I was seriously stupid to think that.

I’m nothing but a useless huge body that can’t even properly cut wood…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tori %}
Hold on, that’s <em>not</em> what I said! No need to take offense like that…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
Yeah… Sorry.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Yuzuru %}
Hm… Takamine-sama, what is this small piece of furniture you’re trying to repair?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
It’s a small desk made for toddlers. The mascot character design on the tabletop is the most adorable thing <em>ever</em>~♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tori %}
Mascot…? Um, where’s its face!?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
The coating peeled off… I’m also shocked that I can’t see its cute face anymore…

The desk’s legs are falling apart too, so it can barely stand properly… I kept going back and forth about whether I should throw it away or not…

But I’m pretty attached to it, so I couldn’t get myself to let go of it… That’s why I wanted to try fixing it, but life’s not that easy, huh…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tori %}
Huh, but I could’ve sworn I heard that you were pretty dexterous with your hands… I guess handicraft isn’t your specialty?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
No way, I’m not dexterous at all… I just like doing little chores and stuff.

I’d be glad to sand the wood, but using my strength to cut with a saw is kinda scary…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Yuzuru %}
I see. You made an error with how much strength to put in, and couldn’t slice the wood cleanly?

In that case, allow me to cut the wood in your place, Takamine-sama.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
Huh!? Are you sure!?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Yuzuru %}
A little wood-cutting wouldn’t take much of my time. If it’s causing you trouble, I could help with repairing the furniture, as well.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori grin %}
Thank you! That’s a huge lifesaver!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tori %}
Since you’re gonna help with repairing it, how about you also re-draw the mascot’s face on the tabletop for him, Yuzuru?

It’s kinda bothering me how it’s faceless.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Yuzuru awkward %}
Oh, no. I believe that is far too heavy of a burden on me…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tori %}
…Ahh, right. You aren’t really all that good at drawing, right? To like, an unbelievable level.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
Master Artist Fushimi not being good at drawing? No, no, what’re you even <em>saying</em>, Himemiya-kun!? There’s nobody more talented than Master Artist in this entire world, y’know!?

I’m fine with him drawing however much he likes, as long as it means I get to see new art from the Master Artist! I’m even willing to build a whole new item for that!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tori %}
Woah, you’re scaring me…! Don’t approach me with such a loud voice, it’s intimidating!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Yuzuru %}
But Takamine-sama, is that really alright…? Was this not one of your favorite mascot characters?

I would feel bad to paint over its face with my art…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
Ahh, no. I was imagining it as you filling the blank space around the mascot character with your art, Master Artist.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tori %}
Hmm? Then you’re just leaving the mascot in the middle faceless?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
Nah, I’ll at least try fixing that by myself.

I’m the one who wanted to fix this, so I shouldn’t leave it all to Master Artist Fushimi.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Yuzuru %}
I see, that’s what you meant. If that’s the case, I won’t need to hold back.

Right then, let’s start repairing, shall we? I’ll start by fixing the desk’s legs.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tori %}
Then I’ll stay close and cheer for you guys. I’m kinda interested to see how the final product will turn out~♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori smileconfident %}
Thank you, you two. I’m also gonna work hard to bring back this mascot’s adorable face…♪
