<th>(Crap… I can’t think of any idol I’m close to…)</th>

<th>(I had a bad feeling about this… I shouldn’t have accepted that magazine interview so thoughtlessly.)</th>

<th>(I don’t think it’s too late to reject the offer if I ask the agency to do it for me, but… I shouldn’t do that, should I…)</th>

<th>(I don’t want there to be complications between our agency and the client, all because of me…)</th>

<th>(But being close to someone isn’t the same as just knowing them, right? It’s practically the same level as “friends”…)</th>

<th>(And it’s hard to tell if it’s only *me* who considers them a friend… What if they think I’m being rude for writing them down as one…?)</th>

<th>(Ahhhh… Just thinking about it makes me wanna die…)</th>

<th>(Maybe I should go for the safe answer and say Tetora-kun or Shinobu-kun… But if I write someone from Ryuseitai, it’ll basically sound like I’m saying I *don’t* have any friends…)</th>

<th>(Urghh… Why do I have to write about my relationships, anyway? What does anyone get out of knowing that…)</th>
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Hinata %}
Yoohoo, Midori-kun~♪ Why’re you holding your head?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
…Must be nice, Hinata-kun. I bet you have loads of friends.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Hinata %}
Um, what’re you on about?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
I’ve got a job related to an interview project, but I have to answer this survey first.

And they dropped a really hard question in there, asking me which idols I’m close to…

I don’t have anyone like that… Ahh, this is so depressing. Maybe I’ll just leave it blank…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Hinata %}
Oh, I get it now~ If you’re that unsure, then how about writing my name?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
Um, no, you’re just somebody I know…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Hinata %}
Oh c’mon now! I think of *you* as a friend, y’know~? ♪

What’s the difference between a friend and an acquaintance to you? What do I gotta do to be your friend, huh~?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
Uurgh, don’t get so close… Um, let’s see…

I guess I’d consider someone I hang out with on my free days a friend…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Hinata %}
Got it! Then let’s find the time to hang out together~♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
E-Ehhh…?

<th>(I ended up cracking under pressure…)</th>

<th>(We didn’t even decide what to do together… What’s he planning?)</th>
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Hinata %}
Heeey, sorry to keep you waiting, Midori-kun~
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
Ah, Hinata-kun… and—
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Sora %}
HaHa\~♪ Good morning, Mido-chan! Sora will greet when he meets someone in the morning\~♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mitsuru %}
Me too~! ‘Morning, Midori-chan!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
U-um. G’morning…?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Hinata %}
Yesterday, I talked to Mitsuru-kun and Sora-kun about our plans today when we were eating lunch in the cafeteria.

They both had a free day too, so I invited them to hang. The more the merrier, after all~♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Sora %}
Sora wanted to play with Mido-chan! Sora is very excited~♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
That’s appreciated…

<th>(Harukawa-kun and Tenma-kun are the good, friendly type, so I know there’s no reason to be so stiff, but…)</th>

<th>(Those three are way better at socializing than I am… I feel like I’m out of place here…)</th>
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mitsuru %}
Midori-chan, what’s wrong? You don’t wanna play with me?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
N-no… That’s not…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mitsuru %}
Really!? Yay! I already thought up what we could play together!

Let’s start with a race! Time to dash dash *dash~☆*
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Sora %}
HiHi\~♪ Sora’s going to chase after Mitsu-chan\~♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
Isn’t this just running around…?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Hinata %}
It’s gonna be good exercise for us. Let’s run too, Midori-kun!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
Ehhh? Are you for real?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Hinata %}
‘Course I am! I promised we’d hang out today, didn’t I?

Let’s move our bodies and laugh until we can’t anymore! Like friends, yeah? ♪
{% endbubble %}

{% img /img/es/idolstory/making100friendsproject/3.jpg %}

{% bubble Midori %}
I-I can’t move anymore…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Hinata %}
Ahaha, take a rest\~♪ You did your best to keep up with Mitsuru-kun and Sora-kun, huh~ Good job, good job\~♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
No, that’s not it… I just didn’t wanna disappoint them when they came here just for me…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Hinata %}
Ohh~ You’re so kind, Midori-kun.

So? Did you have fun?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
I did, but I’d only wanna do this once in a while… I prefer taking it easy in my room on holidays.

<th>(I was dragged into other games too, like tag and hide-and-seek, but…)</th>

<th>(I didn’t hate it. Even though I’m so exhausted now…)</th>

<th>(Maybe the reason I wouldn’t mind hanging out again… is because I see them as friends?)</th>

Hey, about the survey I have to do… Could I write your name down for the “which idols are you close to” question, Hinata-kun…?

Tenma-kun and Harukawa-kun, too… It’s alright if you don’t want me to, though…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Sora %}
Sora would never mind! Sora and Mido-chan are friends~♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mitsuru %}
Me too! I wanna get closer and closer to you, so let’s hang out again!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Hinata %}
Ahaha, then how about we hang out next week, too? ♪ ‘Cause we’re all friends here~
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
*Next week?* Urghh, I *just* said I’d rather do this once in a while…

<th>(Oh yeah, wasn’t there another question that asked what I do on my free days…? I wrote down a safe answer like reading manga and stuff, but—)</th>

<th>(I’ll write down what happened today instead. ‘Cause we’re bound to hang out together again, anyway…♪)</th>
