{% bubble Hinata %}
Yoohoo, Midori-kun\~! I’m so glad I caught you here; this makes my life easier\~♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
Huh? Were you looking for me…?

Did I do something wrong? I can’t think of anything I could’ve done… Umm…

Sorry anyway, whatever it was…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Hinata %}
I know it’s totally like you to apologize without even knowing why, but there’s no need to do that! You didn’t do anything wrong!

If anything, I should be the one apologizing, maybe?

Here's your math textbook, thanks for lending it to me\~ Good thing we're in different classes, huh? I’m so glad I have you as a friend\~♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
Ahh, so *that’s* why… Yeah, no problem.

You brought it all the way back to the dorms? You could’ve given it to me at school…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Hinata %}
I did try looking for you after classes were over, but I couldn’t find you anywhere.

Also, I figured it’s useful to have the book around for reviewing, so I brought it back with me.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
Huh? Are you the type to review before class, Hinata-kun…?

Is there really any point to figuring stuff out on your own when the teacher’s right there…? I feel like that’s more likely to take more of your time…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Hinata %}
Yeah, I getcha real bad\~ I’m not the type to review on my own, either\~♪ Classes are enough for me!

I wasn’t sure if you were the same as me, though, so I brought it back just in case you needed it.

But wow, who would’ve known we’d *both* be the type to skip reviewing\~? That's how you know we’re besties\~☆
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
Uh, there are a lot of other people who don’t do it either, though… Hm?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Hinata %}
Ah—It’s Sora-kun! He’s carrying a pretty big backpack with him. I wonder where he’s off to?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Sora %}
HaHa\~♪ Sora’s going to have a sleepover party with Shisho\~ and Grand-Shisho\~!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
It’s already late outside, so I’m guessing you mean in the dorms…? Do you really need to pack that much for it?
{% endbubble %}

{% img /img/es/idolstory/smalluniverse/cg.jpg %}

{% bubble Sora %}
Mido-chan, would you like to know what’s inside? Sora’ll show you~!

There’s a change of clothes, toothbrush and toothpaste, a cup, snacks, and—
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Hinata %}
Woah, woah! You don’t have to go through the whole list! Right, Midori-kun?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
Y-Yeah. You really surprised me there, I didn’t expect you to open up your bag on the floor…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Sora %}
HiHi~♪ Sora apologizes for surprising you! Please forgive Sora!

Sora will head off to Shisho\~’s room now! Bye bye\~♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Hinata %}
Mhm, have fun~

A sleepover party, huh? Sounds fun! Hey, Midori-kun, we should throw one, too~♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
Ehhh… Don't wanna…
{% endbubble %}

{% note narration %}
**Translator's Note:** This is only the first half of the story. I decided to translate only this part as this story is a bit different from the usual, and the second half is entirely unrelated to the first (It involves Natsume, Sora, and Wataru only)
