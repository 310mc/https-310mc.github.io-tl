{% bubble Makoto %}
Alright then, Shinobu-kun. Let’s start preparing for today’s noon broadcast!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shinobu v2 %}
Yuuki-dono!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Makoto %}
Woah!? What’s wrong, Shinobu-kun? What’s the determined look for…?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shinobu v2 %}
Allow me to handle all of the preparations for this broadcast! In the meantime, I’d like you to wait while you read the script.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Makoto %}
Huh? Are you sure? But you’re the one who wrote the script, so I was thinking of doing the preparations at least…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shinobu v2 %}
Don’t worry about it! So come on, leave everything to me…☆
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Makoto %}
Alright, I’m counting on you.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shinobu v2 %}
Right, first I’ll start by turning on the PC.

…Alright! It’s on! Now I only need to make sure the audio from the PC plays clearly…

Then I need to adjust the microphone’s position…

Heh-heh! ♪ The setup for our broadcast is complete!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Makoto %}
Wonderful work~! You really are amazing, Shinobu-kun. You basically don’t even need my help anymore.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shinobu v2 %}
It’s nothing worthy of praise, really. I have done this many times by now.

Plus, this is the final noon broadcast that you will be holding, Yuuki-dono.

I wanted to show you that I can prepare everything for the broadcast perfectly all on my own…♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Makoto %}
Heheh, you’ve grown to be so reliable, Shinobu-kun. With how perfect your setup was, I know I can leave everything to you now~♪

I’m graduating soon, after all. And the theme of this broadcast is about graduation too, right?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shinobu v2 %}
Indeed it is! And for this broadcast, I have interviewed many graduating students about their memories in Yumenosaki Academy!

For the songs we’ll be playing, I made sure to make them related to celebrating someone’s departure, or a graduation-related song.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Makoto %}
You really did prepare everything, Shinobu-kun — There was nothing I needed to do. The only thing I did in the end was a final check-up of the script.

I feel so moved somehow… You’ve really grown wonderfully, haven’t you?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shinobu v2 %}
Heheh, this is your final grand moment as a Broadcast Committee member, Yuuki-dono. I worked very hard for this day! ♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Makoto %}
You could’ve relied on me a little, at least. Aren’t you also busy with the Student Council elections?[^1]
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shinobu worried %}
P-Please don’t mention the elections!

I had never intended to run for election, and the reason it turned out that way is due to me being unable to refuse others… So I ended up being swept away with the flow…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Makoto %}
But you still did your job for the elections, so I really can’t help but think you’re amazing.

Seeing you work so hard reminds me of the first time you had to do the noon broadcast on your own.[^2]
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shinobu v2 %}
Ahaha, that takes me back. I was still a novice back then.

If I recall correctly, I only realized that I forgot the script at home once it was time to begin, and that was when Yuuki-dono and Isara-dono helped me.

Ahh, I still feel so embarrassed by such an extreme mistake…

Had I done that for my election speech, I would’ve been severely reprimanded. Just the thought of it makes me shiver…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Makoto %}
But in a way, you could say that it’s <em>because</em> you went through that experience that you haven’t made that same mistake since.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shinobu v2 %}
That may be true. I made sure that the script was with me this time, just like I have been doing for all broadcasts since then.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Makoto %}
Then that really does prove you’ve grown so wonderfully, Shinobu-kun.

Mhm, mhm! Just knowing you’re here in the Broadcast Committee gives me relief! I know I can leave it all to you from here on out without any worries.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shinobu srsthinking %}
………
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Makoto %}
Huh? What’s wrong, Shinobu-kun? D-Did I say something upsetting?
{% endbubble %}

{% img /img/es/idolstory/backstageradio/cg.jpg %}

{% bubble Shinobu worried %}
N-No, you haven’t… You haven’t, but… You’ve been complimenting me over and over again for the past few minutes, Yuuki-dono.

And now you’re saying “I can leave it all to you from here on out”… Where is this coming from!? Is this our final farewell or something…!?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Makoto worried %}
No, no! That’s going too far! Don’t assassinate me just because you’re a ninja~…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shinobu sigh2 %}
Uuu… Please don’t suddenly make it sound like we’re parting ways… It makes me feel so lonely, I could cry~…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Makoto awkward %}
I think Shinobu-kun’s the one who brought up the parting ways thing… But you’re right, I kind of got too sentimental. Sorry about that.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Makoto %}
Come on, hold back those tears, Shinobu-kun. If you cry now, it’ll be heard through the broadcast.

If everyone hears you crying, they’ll worry about you, too.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shinobu v2 %}
I am aware. This is Yuuki-dono’s final noon broadcast; I don’t want it to end with me shedding tears.

I would much rather we all look back on our fun memories in school, so that we’re all smiling by the end of the broadcast.

That’s how I plan to flawlessly fulfil today’s broadcast!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Makoto %}
Mhm, that’s the spirit. That’s a wonderful smile on your face, Shinobu-kun~♪

Right, it’s almost time. Let’s begin the broadcast, shall we?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shinobu v2 %}
Roger that! We shall start with the greeting and title call first. Right then, I’ll turn on the microphone…♪

“Hello everyone in Yumenosaki Academy~♪ Today’s noon broadcast is held by Sengoku Shinobu and…”
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Makoto %}
“Yuuki Makoto~ There’s only a little bit left before graduation for the third years. What have you all been up to during your last bit of lunch break?”
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shinobu v2 %}
“As an appetizer to further enjoy your lunch break with color and delight — We present to you the Yumenosaki Academy☆Youth RADIO! Let’s begin~☆”
