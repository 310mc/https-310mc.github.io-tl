{% bubble Yuta hair %}
Oh, so that’s who’s been walking with his head down — Hey, Midori-kun! Are you heading home now?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
…Yuuta-kun?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Yuta hair %}
What’s with that response? Was it that surprising that I greeted you?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
Well, we aren’t on such close terms to talk to each other, so, yeah… Also, usually the one who talks to me is your older brother…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Yuta hair %}
Wow, you didn’t hesitate to answer that way, huh. Even after all the strawberry picking we did together…

Also, I feel like it’s kind of nonsensical to refer to us as “older brother” and “younger brother” at this point, y’know~
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
Strawberry picking, huh… That feels like so long ago now… I wonder if I’ll have to help out again this year…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Yuta hair %}
He *completely* ignored the other half of what I said…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
Please let my spring holidays go okay… Please don’t make me help out with anything…

<th>(—That being said, this feels weird. Maybe it’s ‘cause Yuuta-kun grew out his hair…)</th>

<th>(I’ve only ever seen him with the same hairstyle as Hinata-kun, so…)</th>
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Yuta hair %}
Why’re you staring at my head? Did my hairstyle pique your interest?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
Not really. It’s a pain, and I’m barely interested…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Yuta hair %}
A-A <em>pain</em>…!?
{% endbubble %}

{% img /img/es/idolstory/makewordseven/cg.jpg %}

{% bubble Midori %}
Yeah, like, I don't really wanna know why you grew out your ha—Woah!?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Yuta hair %}
Do you even *know* how it feels to be told you’re a “pain” by someone as pretty as you!?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
I don’t… but please don’t tug at my arm out of nowhere…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Yuta hair %}
I can’t *believe* you’d reply to someone asking how their new hairdo looks with “a pain”… You’d be beaten to the floor if it weren’t for your pretty face, m’kay?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
You didn’t ask me *that* way, and I don’t approve of violence, okay…

<th>(But I can tell this whole situation’s turned into an *actual* pain… Why’s he so insistent to talk to me…?)</th>
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Yuta hair %}
Alright, you leave me no choice! Midori-kun, come with me!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
Ehhhh…?
{% endbubble %}

<div class="msr-location">
    <p><span><b>Location:</b> Empty Classroom</span></p>
</div>

{% img /img/es/idolstory/makewordseven/2.jpg %}

{% bubble Yuta hair %}
Alright, sit on the teacher’s podium.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
<th>(I just wanna head home… But he dragged me here by force, so maybe I’ll get to leave if I just listen to what he has to say for now…)</th>

I have a genuine question but, did you have something to talk to me about…?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Yuta hair %}
I didn’t, until just a second ago. I mean, think about it—

I grew out my hair because I wanted *you* to look at me, and was so nervous to find out what you’d say—
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
Erm, you didn’t grow it out for me, though, right?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Yuta hair %}
Only for you to tell me it’s a <em>pain!</em> That you’re *barely* interested! Of all things, a “pain”!?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
Umm, well, that’s ‘cause—

Even if you did tell me why, I don’t really care either way… I think we’re all free to do whatever we like to our hair… It’s not really something I particularly care about, so…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Yuta hair %}
Erm, you didn’t get into this much detail earlier, y’know…? Also, I see you now added “don’t really care” on top of everything, huh…

Well, I suppose when it comes to the two of us — our faces are the same even if we do change our hairdos.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
…Well, yeah, ‘cause you’re twins.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Yuta hair %}
Mmm~ What a clear-cut response.

Anyway, I know it’s a bit odd for me to ask directly, but don’t you have an actual compliment you could give me?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
Compliment…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Yuta hair %}
I mean, I changed how I look and <em>everything</em>. I’d love a compliment or two.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
Compliment…?

<th>(I don’t really know what I could say… Actually, Yuuta-kun’s reeeally pushy today, huh…)</th>

<th>(He may not let me off until I give him one…)</th>
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Yuta hair %}
Ahaha, first you’re staring at me, now you’re looking away in deep thought… This is fun to watch~♪

So? Could you come up with a nice compliment?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
No… I’m not really good at complimenting people in the first place…

Whenever I *do* compliment someone, their response is just something like, “wow, that’s rare”… And whenever I get complimented, I just start to overthink what they could even mean by those words…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Yuta hair %}
Ahh~… Yeah, I get what you mean — I also get really exaggerated responses sometimes when I give honest compliments.

But that’s *exactly* why I’d love to get a compliment from you, Midori-kun! C’mon, you’ve got this!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
Erm, there’s nothing to *get* here, though…?

<th>(Since his hair’s long, it must be more work to wash and dry it… And tying it up every day must add more to the workload.)</th>

<th>(But maybe it’s easier having it tied up…? Ah, speaking of which—)</th>

It’s gotten easier to distinguish you from Hinata-kun, which is nice.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Yuta hair %}
…………
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
Was that not good enough?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Yuta hair %}
More like, was that *even* a compliment? I can’t even tell if that was a positive comment or not!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
Oh… I thought that, since it’s no longer possible to mix you two up, I wouldn’t end up making you feel uncomfortable…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Yuta hair %}
Oh, I see. Well, I guess that’s your way of being kind, yeah…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
…Anyway, sorry, but — I have to help out at my family's greengrocer store, so could I go now?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Yuta hair %}
Huh? Oh, yeah, sure. Sorry for keeping you here, I had no idea.

Alright then, we’ll keep the compliment for when we see each other tomorrow! See you later, Midori-kun~♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
Ehhh— You’re gonna keep at it…?
{% endbubble %}

{% img /img/es/idolstory/makewordseven/3.jpg %}

<div class="msr-narration">
    <p>Next day…</p>
</div>

{% bubble Yuta unknown %}
Ah, Midori-kun! Good morning~
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
<th>(Uu, I don’t have to turn around to know who it is… The first person I meet in the morning has gotta be—)</th>

Good morning, Yuuta-kun…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Yuta hair %}
Ahaha. Is it *that* awkward to see me after what happened yesterday?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
No, it’s more like—…

<th>(I felt so restless and nervous after he told me to give him a compliment the next day…)</th>

<th>(But it’s best to give him one now, right? I just need to make sure it isn’t offensive, and something positive…)</th>

…Yuuta-kun.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Yuta hair %}
Hm?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
That hairstyle really suits the current you. It’s pretty nice, isn’t it…?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Yuta hair %}
…Ah—Huh? Um, did you just compliment my hair…?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
You *told* me to yesterday…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Yuta hair %}
Ahaha, oh yeah, I did, huh? Wow, I didn’t expect you to actually compliment me…♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori v2 %}
…Why’re you laughing?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Yuta hair %}
Sorry, sorry. I just wanted to get back at you for saying it’s a pain that I was talking to you, so I teased you a little.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
…? Wait, so you were just messing with me?

*Sigh…* I’m so depressed… I thought about it for *so* long, too…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Yuta hair %}
I’m sorry, really. Thanks for giving it a deep thought. I’m really happy to get a compliment about who I am right now! ♪

If I ever try changing up my hairstyle, will you share your thoughts with me again?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
Um, no… That um, really *does* sound like a pain…
