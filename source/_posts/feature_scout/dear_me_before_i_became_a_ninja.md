<th>(Shu-tatatata… I’ve arrived♪)</th>

<th>(It seems like Anzu-dono’s not here yet. There’s still some time before we have to meet, so I’ll just wait for her on the bench.)</th>

<th>(It’s my turn to get a personalized outfit at last. I’m so happy, I can’t stop grinning~)</th>

<th>(A one and only special outfit made just for *me*… Mhm, sounds amazing!)</th>

<th>(I’m really looking forward to seeing how it’ll turn out!)</th>

Ah, it’s Anzu-dono! Heeey, Anzu-dono~☆ I’m over here~

Come, come, sit next to me! …Oh no, I also just got here.

The weather today is really nice, I should've brought my lunchbox with me. It would’ve felt like a picnic since we’re in the Hanging Gar—

Ah, forgive me. I strayed off topic.

We’re going to talk about my personalized outfit, right? I assure you that I did *not *forget!

But I don’t know how the procedure works. If it’s alright, would you please teach me~?

…Wow, you even prepared a design idea notebook for me?

Okay! I’ll take a look right away. Let’s see…♪

{% bubble Shinobu %}
Hmm~, all of these design ideas can be summed up with one word: brilliant!

To think you had this much data on ninjas… Are you perhaps a ninja lover as well, Anzu-dono?

You’re not, but you *did* prepare all of this for my sake? Even though you’re so busy… I’m extremely grateful!

Mhm, I agree. I also think the ninja motifs are great. You sure understand me well~♪

I can’t wait for the finished product. I’m excited to see what kind of ninja attire it’ll turn out to be♪

…Huh? You want *my* opinion…?

I wouldn’t know what to add to this, though. All of your design suggestions were very detailed and perfect already, so—

It’s not perfect since you have yet to implement my request into the design, you say? I see… Hmmm~…

I wish for the outfit to be ninja-like, so I don’t have any other desires beyond that… Hmmm, it’s hard to give you an immediate answer.

…You want me to carefully think about it with the rough sketch you plan to make?

Understood! It’ll be easier for me to visualise what I want if I have a drawing, so that would be very helpful.

I’m looking forward to the rough sketch~. Well then, Anzu-dono, I’ll leave it to you!

Hmhmhm\~♪ My own\~ personalized outfit\~♪ Hmhmhm\~♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora %}
You sound like you’re in a good mood, huh~? Hope you don’t mind me sitting here.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shinobu %}
Be my guest~♪ Are you also having a late lunch, Tetora-kun?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora %}
Yep. I just got here a second ago since my job starts in the evening.

Anyway, are you next in line to get a personalized outfit?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shinobu %}
Ehhh!? How did you know!? I have not told anyone yet…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora %}
You said it yourself— Or well, you were humming a song, y’know? Going all, “my own~ personalized outfit~♪”.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shinobu %}
R-really? I didn’t realize I was doing that… Uuu, so embarrassing~
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora %}
Ahaha, you’re just that happy about it, so it makes sense. It’s your very own outfit, after all!

There’s a ton of idols in here, so it doesn’t really hit home when the topic of “personalized outfits” comes up, but…

Now that you, a member of Ryuseitai, have been chosen as the next idol, it’s finally hitting me that this really is happening. I’m excited for the day I’m chosen to be up next—☆

Speaking of, what’s yours gonna be like? I’m guessing something ninja-like?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shinobu %}
Yes! Actually—

Oh! I got a message from Anzu-dono on HoldHands. Excuse me for a minute, Tetora-kun.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora %}
‘Kay. Don’t mind me, I’ll just be chowing down.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shinobu %}
<th>(She sent over the finished rough sketch already… Even though we only just talked about it this very morning.)</th>

<th>(It’s a splendid ninja attire design that suits me well. I feel like this is good enough, and there’s no point in me pondering anymore about it.)</th>

<th>(However, Anzu-dono sought out my opinion. I wonder if it’ll trouble her instead if I say *nothing* at all…?)</th>
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora %}
…Shinobu-kun, what’s wrong? Your face is all puckered, like the time you ate something sour, y’know?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shinobu %}
The truth is, I received a rough sketch of my personalized outfit from Anzu-dono, and it looks like this—
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora %}
Ohhh~ The design isn’t *just* ninja-themed, it’s even showing off what makes you *you*. You can really tell this is one of Anzu-anego’s designs!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shinobu %}
What makes me, *me*?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora %}
Yup! You may be small in size, but your relentless mentality is why you’re so manly and cool.

This outfit really highlights your fortitude to never give in no matter what happens.

And that fortitude reminds me of the time you jumped through a ring of fire; that was *so* awesome!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shinobu %}
Hehehe, you’re going to make me blush~. You really do pay close attention to me, don’t you? ♪

<th>(It’s not just Tetora-kun, but Anzu-dono as well… Here, I have many comrades who pay close attention to me and accept me for who I am.)</th>

<th>(Everyday is a blessing — I want to tell that to my past self[^1], who was all alone…)</th>

<th>(I want to tell him that it’s okay to love what you love. Because people who will accept that about you are definitely out there in the world.)</th>

<th>(Because a place where you can voice that love of yours so loudly is too.)</th>

<th>(I am proof of that. Because I refused to abandon my dreams, this Shinobu Sengoku is able to stand here right now.)</th>

<th>(If I can convey that to the people who are like my past self by wearing this ninja attire—)</th>

…Ah, that’s it!

Originally, the title was *katsute no boku e* <th>(かつての『ぼく』へ)</th>, lit. “To who I once was”. However, to convey the significance of the pronoun used, we chose to translate it like this. Explanation is in the translation note below:

Hmm. As expected, no one’s around when it’s this late at night.

I won’t be in anyone’s way if I do it here. After all, it’d be inexcusable to scatter things around in the room and make a mess this late.

Heave-ho… Alright then, it’s time to open this wicker box[^2] of memories♪

Nihihi. These photos and handmade picture scrolls really bring me back. I didn’t have a master or any ninja companions, so I had to learn everything through imitation at first.

I would constantly practice throwing origami shuriken at the tree everyday, even though they can’t pierce into anything at all…

And the very first item I bought with my own money is this shuriken toy — the thing that started everything.

Mm— I can feel a presence…!

<th>(Phew, that was close. To think that someone would come here during this time of the night…)</th>

<th>(Ah, wait! I ended up hiding myself with the Camouflage Jutsu out of habit…! Even though I have nothing to feel guilty about…!)</th>
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tsukasa %}
Good lord. Neglecting to return a book is so ill-mannered. And it just *had* to be under my name, too…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shinobu %}
<th>(This voice sounds like Suou-kun. Hmm, I see — it seems like he’s here to return a book.)</th>

<th>(I feel awkward staying hidden, but this doesn’t seem to be the right mood for a conversation, so I’ll stay still and wait until he leaves.)</th>

<th>(…Wahhh!? Oh no, I left my box on the floor! If he discovers it, he’ll immediately find it suspicious. I must quickly retrieve it—)</th>

<th>(Slowly reach out your hand… Little by little…)</th>
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tsukasa %}
Oh? There’s a strange box here—

Eep! A hand came out of the bookshelf— Don’t tell me it’s a ghost…!?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shinobu %}
Ahh~! It’s not a ghost, it’s me!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tsukasa %}
S-Shinobu-kun? What are you doing here…?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shinobu %}
That wicker box is filled with my treasured items, and just as I was reminiscing about the memories of my past…

I was surprised by your approaching presence and hid myself out of habit. I apologize for startling you~
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tsukasa %}
Oh, so that’s what this box was. This origami shuriken that fell down— is this one of your treasured items as well?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shinobu %}
That’s right. It’s the first shuriken I ever made! Thank you for picking it up for me, Suou-kun.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tsukasa %}
You’re welcome. You’ve always had dexterous hands, I see.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shinobu %}
Back in those days, I had no choice but to make them myself~. So most of the things in this box are handmade~♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tsukasa %}
Marvelous! There are so many ninja-related items in here… I can tell that you truly do not give up when it comes to the values you have, as well as where you individuality is concerned — how splendid~♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shinobu %}
Me? Splendid?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tsukasa %}
Yes, very much so. People always keep their interests and ambitions deep within their heart.

However, not everyone can make their dream come true. It’s not uncommon for people to give up halfway.

Yet you were able to continue staying the way you wished to be. Your level of persistence is not of the ordinary.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shinobu %}
For me, *being* a ninja is not painful. But I’m very happy to hear such praises.

However, I’m still not fully-fledged yet. I will continue to work hard at my training as a ninja~!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tsukasa %}
Fufu, that’s the spirit~♪

Ahh, but please do refrain from startling people like you did earlier.

— The next day —
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shinobu %}
Anzu-dono, I apologize for asking you to come here so suddenly. But I have something that I *really* want to give you…

Since you’re making my personalized outfit for me, I want you to accept this!
{% endbubble %}

{% img <th>(Light Beaming from the Darkness)</th> Shinobu Sengoku CG.png %}

{% bubble Shinobu %}
This plastic shuriken clearly looks like a toy and has scratches all over, but it’s also the *very* first item I bought with my own pocket money— it’s my dearest treasure.

This simple toy is proof of how that tiny first-step I took in the past has helped to make me the ninja I am now.

I’m still inexperienced, so this might be an aspiration beyond my capabilities right now—

But I want to become a heroic ninja— one that can be the “light of hope” to people who have things they love, yet who are afraid of turning that love into a dream they can hold.

That’s why I want to add a large shuriken like this one to the design you made, Anzu-dono! So that all of those people can easily spot it!

So everyone can see how I daringly chase after my own dreams—!

…Ehehe. I knew you would say that. I’m counting on you, Anzu-dono♪

Thank you for always watching over me. Because you and my comrades are here for me, I am able to truly live my life…♪

## Translation Notes
[^1]: He refers to his past self with *boku* instead of *sessha*, the first-person pronoun Shinobu usually uses. *boku* is a common first-person pronoun for boys, but *sessha* is a first-person pronoun specifically known to be used by ninjas.
[^2]: Tsudzura (葛籠): A traditional Japanese lacquer wicker basket made with bamboo and lined with Japanese washi paper. It comes with a lid and is shaped like a box.
