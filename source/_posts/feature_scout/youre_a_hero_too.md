{% bubble Chiaki smileconfident %}
Bam! Thank you for waiting, Anzu! Morisawa Chiaki is here in all his glory…☆

“I’m sorry to make you come all the way here”? Don’t sweat it! Aren’t we on good terms?

Anyhow, let’s get to the main topic. We’re here to talk about my personalized outfit, right?

Fuhahaha! I’m finally next! I’ve been eagerly waiting for the day when you’d call for my turn!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki snicker %}
…You bet that I’d want an outfit in a hero-like style? Heh-heh-heh… I see that you’re interested to know what design I’ve thought up.

This right here! — is the ultimate vision of my personalized outfit! ☆
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki curious %}
…Mm? Why do you look so troubled?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki smilesoft %}
I drew the design to make it visually understandable, but… It seems as though it had the opposite effect, huh?

The head piece is a helmet which covers the whole face. I took visibility into account, so I made the face shield bigger.

The part dangling from the neck is a scarf. It’s two meters long. Imagining it flowing in the wind fires up my heart…♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki shocked %}
…Mm? You don’t think it’s possible to implement this design? Why do you say that, Anzu!?

Nobody will be able to see my face with the helmet on, and the scarf might get tangled up while dancing…? Now that you mention it, I suppose that’s true…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki smile %}
Then what about the gears attached to both arms!? They glow in seven different colors to the beat of the song! ☆

…It likely won’t be possible with the budget we have? Mm~…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki frown %}
<th>(Well, this puts me in a bind… I didn’t think my design would get rejected, so I’m not sure where to go from here…)</th>

<th>(But I’m just an idol — and I know she, as a producer, knows what she’s talking about.)</th>

<th>(I suppose I’d best follow along here…)</th>
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki awkward %}
…Yeah, you’re exactly right, Anzu. I was only focused on making my ideals a reality, without considering much of anything else.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki grin %}
Alright, let’s scrap this design entirely!

Fuhaha, there’s no need to feel sorry. I won’t lose heart to something like this! I’ll show you that I can come up with an even better design…☆

Mm? I think someone’s here…

Ooh, Hero-kun! Hello there! <em><th>(Waves)</th></em>
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Hiiro %}
Hello there, you two. Anzu-san, I’m happy to see you here.

A part of this outfit got loose, so I brought it over in hopes of asking someone to fix it.

…You can fix it right away? Mhm, then I’ll wait right here.

Hm, were the two of you in the middle of discussing outfit designs? Is this one for Ryuseitai?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki %}
Ah, no. This is meant to be my personalized outfit.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Hiiro nod %}
Ooh, your individuality really shines through. It truly feels like a special outfit of its own. I’m excited to see the final version.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki awkward %}
Thank you, but this is a rejected design. I was hoping for a hero-style outfit, but I found out it isn’t suitable for an idol…

It’s not easy to come up with outfit designs. I have to applaud Anzu for having made so many outfits thus far.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Hiiro serious %}
“Hero”… Chiaki-senpai, you seem to be very fixated over this “hero”.

But what <em>is</em> a hero? I asked Aira about it once, but he didn’t provide me with a clear answer.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki grin %}
“What is a hero,” huh? That almost sounds like a subtitle for a movie.

I’ll gladly teach you! “A hero is a cool being who helps the vulnerable”…☆
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Hiiro curious %}
Hm… Martial artists also help those who are vulnerable. Are martial artists also heroes?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki northinking %}
Hmm… You <em>could</em> call that a hero, but what I’m thinking of is a little different from that.

But hrm, how do I convey that to you… It’s something you have to feel, rather than think about…

Oh, I know! Hero-kun, why don’t you and I go to an amusement park? Seeing is believing, after all! It’ll be easier to understand if you were to see it with your own two eyes.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Hiiro nod %}
Do heroes live in that “amusement park” place? Mhm, please do take me there.

I’ll finally be able to know what a hero is. I’m so happy…♪
{% endbubble %}

<div class="msr-location">
    <p><span><b>Location:</b> Amusement Park</span></p>
</div>

{% img /img/es/idolstory/aherotoo/2.jpg %}

<div class="msr-narration">
    <p>A few days later…</p>
</div>

{% bubble Hiiro %}
So this is the amusement park… There are building structures I would never find in my hometown. How intriguing.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki %}
Ahh… This is your very first time coming to an amusement park, Hero-kun?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Hiiro %}
Mhm. I asked Aira to teach me all about it before visiting, though. Apparently, there are various kinds of games here. I’m interested in the one where you ride a horse.

It’s been a while since I last went horseback riding. I thought that people in the city don’t ride horses, but it seems like I was wrong!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki srsthinking %}
Ah, do you mean the merry-go-round? Can that really be called horseback riding…? Mmm~…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki curious %}
…Anzu, why’re you tugging on my clothes? “We should head over to the show”?

You’re right. The hero show’s starting soon.

Hero-kun, over here!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Hiiro %}
Mhm. I’m following you!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki %}
Anzu, thank you for accompanying us today. …“Is it alright for me to be here”?

Fuhaha, of course it is. Everyone needs a break, be it a hero, idol, or producer!

I’d like you to give yourself a break today. Your job may be important, but you still have the right to rest all the same…♪
{% endbubble %}

<div class="msr-narration">
    <p>During the final act of the hero show…</p>
</div>

{% img /img/es/idolstory/aherotoo/3.jpg %}

{% bubble Hiiro shocked %}
—Ah! Chiaki-senpai, the hero’s transformation has worn off.

And the villain is only getting stronger… He’ll lose at this rate!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki smilesoft %}
Don’t panic. The most important thing is to hold an unyielding heart that never stops believing.

Those who believe in the hero make him stronger! Hang in there! Don’t lose now, Hero!

C’mon, you two! Let’s cheer with the kids!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Hiiro grin %}
…Mhm. Hang in there, Hero! Stand back up!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki grin %}
Fuhahahaha! ☆ Keep at it! Defeat never suits a hero!

<th>(Oooh, the hero suit looks even cooler than it did earlier! That’s impressive… The suit could still evolve even further…!)</th>
{% endbubble %}

{% img /img/es/idolstory/aherotoo/cg.jpg %}

{% bubble Chiaki herotoocg %}
<th>(No matter the predicament they fall in, a hero will always be able to stand up for what they believe in. They can get stronger and stronger…)</th>

<th>(Ahh, right… That’s why I—…)</th>
{% endbubble %}

## Chapter 2

{% img /img/es/idolstory/aherotoo/4.jpg %}

<div class="msr-narration">
    <p>After the hero show…</p>
</div>

{% bubble Hiiro %}
That was really interesting! So *that’s* what it means to be a hero!

A person who never loses heart no matter the hardship — Who only grows stronger for someone else’s sake… I see what you mean now about heroes and martial artists; they may have a few differences.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki grin %}
Fuhaha! It makes me so happy to see you learn the charm of heroes, Hero-kun!

However, that was only the tip of the iceberg. The more you learn about heroes, the more you’ll grow fond of them. Their history runs deep, y’know!

I’ll hold a tokusatsu marathon party in Starmony Dorm sometime! I’d <em>love</em> to show you my tokusatsu DVD collection…☆
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Hiiro %}
Mhm! I’m looking forward to it.

By the way, what are we going to do now? The hero show is over…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki %}
We’re in an amusement park, so let’s enjoy some attractions!

Hero-kun, is there anything that piques your interest? Did you still want to try the merry-go-round?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Hiiro %}
That would be nice, but I’m also curious about the screams I’ve been hearing. What is that spiral-shaped object over there?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki %}
That’s a roller coaster. It’s a thrill ride that travels over the rails at high speed, and makes people enjoy the sensation of fear.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Hiiro curious %}
Sensation of fear…? Why would people want to experience something fearsome?

I’d love to find out the reason. Anzu-san, Chiaki-senpai, let’s ride this so-called “roller coaster”!
{% endbubble %}

{% img /img/es/idolstory/aherotoo/5.jpg %}

<div class="msr-narration">
    <p>A while later…</p>
</div>

{% bubble Chiaki cry2 %}
<th>(I didn’t think we’d go spinning in a teacup right after the roller coaster ride…)</th>

<th>(Both Anzu and Hero-kun seem fine, so I have to act composed. Hang in there, my semicircular canals…!)</th>[^1]
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Hiiro %}
Fufu, both of those attractions were so interesting! It’s as Aira said; this is the land of dreams.

Chiaki-senpai, I’d like to experience that one next.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki %}
A-Ah, sure—
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki shocked %}
<th>(—Wait, a haunted house…!?)</th>
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Hiiro grin %}
So there are not only heroes here, but ghosts too? I’m excited to see what sort of ghosts I’ll meet. ♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki srsthinking %}
…………
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Hiiro serious %}
What’s wrong, Chiaki-senpai?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki awkward %}
Ah— No… Haha. Sorry, I’m just a little tired.

I think I’ll go rest on that bench over there, so how about the two of you go to the haunted house?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Hiiro %}
I’ll accompany you if you’d like to take a break first. I want to enjoy the attractions with all three of us.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki %}
I appreciate the thought, but it’s alright. There are many other attractions here, after all.

Go ahead and try this one out with Anzu.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Hiiro %}
Hm… Alright then. Let’s go, Anzu-san.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki sigh3 %}
…They’re gone. Whew…

<th>(I wasn’t lying about not feeling well, but it’s still so pathetic of me to stay behind…)</th>
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki curious %}
<th>(…Mm?)</th>

Anzu… Why are you here…? Where’s Hero-kun?

You told him to go to the haunted house alone? …You came back because you couldn’t leave me on my own when I seemed unwell?

You even bought me cold water… Thank you.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki awkward %}
…Haha, I’m so pathetic. I’m making you take care of me even nows…

When this whole time, I was hoping to give *you* a chance to rest and forget about work for a while…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki curious %}
…This has nothing to do with work? You came back because you were worried for me?

No matter who the person may be, you’d make sure to help them if they’re in trouble… and that includes me? Even when I’m everyone’s hero?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki smile %}
I see now. If I were in your position, I’m sure I would have done the exact same.

…Anzu, you’re a hero of your own, aren’t you? You help the vulnerable and support them.

You’re someone indispensable to me.
{% endbubble %}

{% img /img/es/idolstory/aherotoo/6.jpg %}

{% bubble Hiiro sigh2 %}
…Sigh. It’s already time to leave. I suppose I have to wake up from my dream at one point.

I’ll miss everyone. What a shame that I have to leave as soon as I became friends with all the ghosts in the haunted house…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki surprised0 %}
You became friends with <em>ghosts</em>…!? How is that even possible…!? Actually, I’d rather not know…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki smileconfident %}
Today may be coming to an end, but dreams can be seen over and over again. You can just come back with a friend next time!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Hiiro %}
Mhm, I’ll do just that! …Ah, they’re selling souvenir gifts over there.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Hiiro shocked %}
Oh no…! I almost forgot that Aira asked me to buy some sort of limited merchandise for him. I’ll quickly go and buy it!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki %}
Mhm, take care of yourself. Anzu and I will wait for you here.

…Hey, Anzu. I know I said to forget about work today, but… Could you lend me an ear for a moment?

While watching the hero show, my personalized outfit came to mind.

A hero suit may be essential for a hero, but… It’s only an outfit, not the actual essence of a hero.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki smilesoft %}
What matters is the beliefs that heroes are born for. The true essence of a hero is the very flesh and bones where those beliefs reside.

While the personalized outfit is made for the idol, it’s also to make the fans happy.

So for the sake of everyone who cheers for me as well, I’d like an outfit design full of my charm as both an idol and a hero. That’s why—

Anzu. Could you and I think up a new outfit design from scratch?

I’m knowledgeable about heroes, and you’ve always watched over idols. If we were to team up, we should be able to create an incredible outfit.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki grin %}
…Thank you. I just <em>knew</em> you’d say that.

With the two of us, I’m sure it will turn out perfect. Let’s work hard together, partner…♪
