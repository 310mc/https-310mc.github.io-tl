<th>(I've finally arrived at the bookstore and all, but the manga I came here for isn't anywhere to be found, huh~?)</th>

<th>(It wasn't in the storefront, so I thought it might've been in the new releases corner… but maybe they're all sold out.)</th>

<th>(Well, if that's the case, I guess I should go to a different… — Oh!)</th>

<th>(Found it! And it's the last copy, too — that was close~)</th>

……Woah there.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
Ah, I'm so sorry. Oh— you're that guy from Eden…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Jun v3 %}
Oh hey, Takamine-kun, I was wondering who it was. 'Sup~
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
Huh? Ah, um, hi… Ughhh, you sound so cheery… You like this manga too, Sazanami-senpai…?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Jun v3 %}
I sure do~ I'm even here to grab it on release day.

On that note, what d'ya mean by *cheery?* Do I really look all that peppy to you?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
That's what your tennis racket bag made me think… Tennis players have that party animal energy…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tori %}
Heeey, just how long are you two gonna stand around chatting for?
{% endbubble %}

{% img /img/es/idolstory/detourencounter/cg.jpg %}

{% bubble Jun v3 %}
Whoops, excuse m… Oh, Himemiya-kun, since when were you here?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tori %}
All this time, actually! You just couldn't see me because the too-tall Takamine was in the way, okay?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
I'm sorry for being so tall… I'm such an eyesore to people… I wish I could just disappear so I stay out of everyone's way…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tori %}
Yeah, yeah, enough of that. That's the last copy, right? If you don’t grab it soon, someone else is gonna nab it, y'know?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Jun v3 %}
Good point. Here you go, Takamine-kun.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
Wha— Please buy it for yourself, Sazanami-senpai. You had your hand on it first…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Jun v3 %}
It's fine, really~ I know some other bookstores, so I'll just pop by 'em for a peek and think of it as exercise.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
I can't put you through that trouble. If I did, I'd be toast the moment some CosPro higher-up found out…

Ermmm… How about I join you…?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Jun v3 %}
Nah, you've already got a copy right here. Please go ahead and buy it, Takamine-kun.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tori %}
You guys seriously aren't getting anywhere… Takamine, you can get it and then just pass it around in the Archives Circle, right?

That's why *I* came with you in the first place, after all ♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Jun v3 %}
Great idea~ I'm all for it. Takamine-kun seems like he'd be up for sharing, after all.

Here's half the cash, so kindly go on and buy the last copy, Takamine-kun.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
*Sigh*… Alright then. I'll go and pay for it…
{% endbubble %}

<div class="msr-narration">
    <p>A few minutes later…</p>
</div>

{% bubble Midori %}
I'm sorry to keep you waiting, I bought it without a hitch…

But are you really okay with letting *me* of all people take it…?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Jun v3 %}
Of course. Please don't worry so much about it.

I never really had the habit of collecting manga in the first place, anyway. Back at my parents' place, I wasn't allowed anything besides idol-related stuff so I couldn't keep any.

When I absolutely *had* to read some, I'd wait for when the volumes came out and then drop by a manga cafe to read 'em, y'see~
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
Seriously…? Not being able to read manga at home… That sounds like a nightmare…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tori %}
It's not all that weird, you know? Even I only got to properly read manga by borrowing from the new Prez, after all.

And even after joining Archives, I had to read in secret until Yuzuru stopped nagging my head off for it.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
Wow… I can't believe you guys weren't even free to read *manga*…

Just the thought of being thrown into a life like that overwhelms me with depression… I could never live without the freedom to at least enjoy my hobbies.

We were talking about manga, so how'd this convo get so dark…? I was expecting something way more casual…

The same way you'd mention your daily lunchbox having broccoli in it…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Jun v3 %}
Broccoli? That stuff's good for building muscle, y'know~ I have it all the time.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
Oh, then… Here you go. This is thanks for letting me have the manga…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Jun v3 %}
Huh? You walk around carrying broccoli with you?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
Ahh, yeah… Not just broccoli, though.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tori %}
Having nothing but veggies is *boring*. If only you could pull out some sweets, too.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
You're asking for the impossible. Sweets aren't veggies, y'know…

Um, if you ever feel like eating a certain veggie, please tell me. I'm from a greengrocer, so… I'll get you as much as you want.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Jun v3 %}
Ooh. Having you tell me that's gonna be a big help~ I'll keep it in mind for the match comin' up soon.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tori %}
A match?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Jun v3 %}
I'm in the tennis club, see. We're gonna be having a practice match with Yumenosaki sometime.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tori %}
*Seriously?* I'd heard something about us having a match, but our opponents are gonna be *Reimei?*
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Jun v3 %}
Hmm? You're in the tennis club?

That's pretty surprising. Since you're in Archives, I thought you'd be the type to be in something like a handicrafts or culture club instead.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tori %}
Geez, look who's talking! You know we're in the same circle, right?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Jun v3 %}
Our school's tennis club isn't all that serious, y'see. This coming practice match is gonna be more for fun than anything else.

But well, since it's a *match*, we don’t plan on losing, of course ♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tori %}
Oh, you've really said it now, huh~? *I'll* be the one to kick all your butts…!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
Ugh, that's right. You play tennis too, Himemiya-kun…

I'm surrounded by *extroverts*… I'm not even depressed anymore, now I just feel like dying…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Jun v3 %}
Broccoli's just the thing in times like these, actually. I heard it helps even with depression.

Here ya go.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
T-Thank you… Wait, this is the one I just gave you…

Please keep it for yourself. I still have lots on me.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Jun v3 %}
*Seriously?* Just how many vegetables do you have in that bag? Forget what happens next in the manga, I'm even more invested in *this*, y'know?
