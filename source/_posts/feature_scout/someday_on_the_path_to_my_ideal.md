{% img /img/es/idolstory/idealpath/1.jpg %}

{% bubble Hinata %}
This is the first meeting…! To discuss Tetsu-kun’s personalized outfit~!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tomoya %}
Y-Yaaay…?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mitsuru %}
This is gonna be super exciting!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Hiiro %}
I don’t quite understand, but I’m in your care!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora %}
Hinata-kun, everything’s so sudden that I can barely understand what’s goin’ on. Couldja explain yourself?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Hinata %}
Eh~? It’s exactly as I said. This meeting is for discussing Tetsu-kun’s personalized outfit together!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora %}
I got that part just fine! What I wanna know is how we got here.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Hinata %}
…I, Aoi Hinata, spotted Anzu-san heading somewhere. I then learned that Anzu-san was off to speak to Tetsu-kun about his personalized outfit, and decided to accompany her.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tomoya %}
That’s when Mitsuru and I came across Hinata and Anzu-san, who were on their way to the dojo. And for whatever reason, we were dragged into tagging along.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Hinata %}
After that, the four of us saw Tetsu-kun and Hiiro-kun cleaning up the dojo. With everyone gathered, that was when the hosting of the meeting was announced—
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora %}
I get how you’re all here now, but did you hafta explain it like it’s a summary of an episode…?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mitsuru %}
Tomo-chan, nice ad-libbing!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tomoya %}
Man, Hinata… Don’t send me a signal through eye contact out of nowhere. I wasn’t expecting that.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Hiiro %}
I see, so the line delivery just now is called ad-libbing. I learned something new!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora %}
Ahh, the conversation’s goin’ all over the place! So basically, Anego and everyone else are all here ‘cuz of my personalized outfit, right?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Hinata %}
You got it! Anzu-san looks fully prepared to take notes, so let’s get to talking about Tetsu-kun’s personalized outfit already! ♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tomoya %}
Is there anything you’d like in particular, Tetora? Like, a certain kinda outfit you wanna wear…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora %}
Mm~ I’d like a cool-looking outfit, but nothin’ specific comes to mind…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mitsuru %}
Whaaat!? This is your <em>personalized</em> outfit! It’d be suuuch a waste if you go about it in such a vague way~!

I struggled at first too, but then I figured out how to convey all my feelings to get the perfect Super Star outfit for me! ☆
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora %}
Yeah, I know that just saying a “cool-looking outfit” wouldn’t be enough as a reference point… But to be honest, I trust Anego with this.

I feel like it’ll all go okay as long as I have Anego make an outfit suitable for me through her own vision.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Hinata %}
Ohh? Anzu-san’s looking super motivated now that she heard that~♪ But I think it’s a little too much pressure on her as well?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Hiiro %}
Hm. Anzu-san seems interested in hearing a little more of Buchou’s thoughts, isn’t that right?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora %}
…Yeah, that makes sense. I don’t mean to trouble Anego, so I’ll try to think it through a li’l.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tomoya %}
I probably shouldn’t say this when I struggled with mine too, but… I think it’d be good to have a basic idea of how you want it to look like, or what you think would be important to have.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora %}
<th>(Somethin’ I think would be important… I got asked that once, just before the Motor Show event happened.)</th>[^1]

<th>(I couldn’t immediately think of an answer back then, either… After that, though, I did manage to find somethin’ certain for myself at that time.)</th>

…Ermm, please wait a moment. I’m tryna think of how to word my thoughts.

An idea that could be useful to Anego… A suggestion Anego could use for reference when making my outfit…?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tomoya %}
Heeey, Tetora~? Your face’s looking all scary, y’know?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mitsuru %}
Yeah! This is all about <em>your</em> outfit, Tetsu-chan, but you just keep mentioning Ne~chan’s name!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Hiiro %}
For Buchou, any outfit would definitely suit him, and he’d look cool no matter what he wears, don’t you think? So that might be why this is difficult for him?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora %}
Ahaha… I don’t have it <em>that</em> good, y’know. My worries are a lot more basic.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Hinata %}
Alright, you know what this means! It’s time to put your mind to it and concentrate, Tetsu-kun! I’ll sit and do <em>zen</em> meditation with you![^2]
{% endbubble %}

{% img /img/es/idolstory/idealpath/2.jpg %}

<div class="msr-narration">
    <p>Two hours later…</p>
</div>

{% bubble Tetora %}
…Everyone left before the sun went down, even Anego… So why’re you still here, Hinata-kun?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Hinata %}
Since I’m the one who opened up the meeting in the dojo, I thought I should join ya in doing meditation, too. Ossu![^3]
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora %}
Don’t imitate me while answering.

……?

—Hinata-kun, couldja wait here for a sec?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Hinata %}
Sure…?

<th>(Huh, there’s a first year outside the dojo. I didn’t even notice he was here.)</th>

<th>(Is Tetsu-kun giving him advice for something? The first year looks to be nodding to his words…)</th>

<th>(…Oh, now he’s bowing his head to Tetsu-kun. I guess the conversation’s over? He’s leaving with such a relieved look on his face…)</th>
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora %}
Sorry to keep ya waiting.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Hinata %}
Nah, not at all. Was that a first-year student just now?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora %}
Yeah. There was somethin’ he wanted to talk to me ‘bout.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Hinata %}
Huh~ You’re a legit senior to the juniors, aren’tcha?

That kid left with such a bright look on his face. I’m guessing it’s ‘cause he got to hear your advice, right?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora %}
I didn’t do anythin’ special, really. He wasn’t sure how to word a message to his colleague, so I gave him a li’l bit of advice, that’s all.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Hinata %}
Still, he came all the way to ask you, yeah? That means he sees you as a reliable senior, no?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora %}
I hope so, it’d make me real happy. Having juniors in my life’s motivating for me, too.

If even someone inexperienced like me could be reliable to him, then I’d love to help him out. I wanna present my best, dependable side as much as possible.

I showed my juniors a pathetic side of me before, too, but… If he still chooses to follow after me…

Then that just makes me wanna grow stronger and bigger for his sake, as well, yeah~?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Hinata %}
……………
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora %}
Hey, c’mon… Don’t go quiet on me.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Hinata %}
Ahh, weeell… I don’t have any close juniors, so that was so new to me… Like, wow, Tetsu-kun’s seriously a reliable man now~♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora %}
Nah, I’m still far from it. I gotta keep up my rigorous trainin’ every day.

…Right, I gotta lock the dojo already. Let’s head out, Hinata-kun.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Hinata %}
Gotcha~♪
{% endbubble %}

## Chapter 2

{% img /img/es/idolstory/idealpath/3.jpg %}

<div class="msr-narration">
    <p>On the way home, to the dorms…</p>
</div>

{% bubble Hinata %}
Tetsu-kun, want chocolate?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora %}
Chocolate?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Hinata %}
I got a mixed bag of chocolate, but I doubt I could eat them all on my own.

Look, there’s all kinds of flavors~ Milk choco, bitter choco, caramel, matcha… There’s a bunch of others too; which do you want?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora %}
Mm~ I’ll have the milk chocolate. A mixed bag just makes me wanna eat the classic flavor first.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Hinata %}
Sure, then I’ll go with matcha. <em><th>(munch, munch)</th>…</em>

Oh yeah, so how’d the meditation go? Anything came to mind for your personalized outfit?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora %}
Mm~… ‘Cuz the meeting earlier was so sudden, all I could really think up was a “cool-looking outfit”, but…

After clearing my head from thoughts, I feel like I’ve gotten myself to think ‘bout “what exactly <em>is</em> a personalized outfit for me?” kinda thing.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Hinata %}
…What do you mean?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora %}
When Shinobu-kun showed me his personalized outfit a while back, I thought it was amazin’ how it represented all the things he loves and considers important.

But I couldn’t think up anythin’ of the sort for myself. So instead, I thought ‘bout myself, wearing some sorta outfit…

Or somethin’ like, “what if my personalized outfit is somethin’ that represents who I am?”. But really, no matter the outfit, that wouldn’t change the side of me I wanna show to others, or the version of myself that I wanna become, right?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Hinata %}
Well, what you wanna do and what you wanna become can only ever be within you. So yeah, that wouldn’t change no matter what you’d wear.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora %}
Right? So at the very least, that’s how I now see my personalized outfit… Like, I can’t really put it into words well, but…

Rather than just having the outfit represent who I am, I feel like I gotta have my own feelings poured into it too, or the outfit’ll be wearing <em>me</em> instead.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Hinata %}
Wow, that’s such a cool, manly way to think. Speaking of, could I ask what version of you you’d like to show, and what you wanna become?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora %}
‘Course you can. I’d like to organize my thoughts while we talk, anyway.

…For somethin’ I wanna show, I think it’s the side of me that’s always growing more as I keep working hard. And for the version I wanna become, that’s always been—
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Hinata %}
A man among men!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora %}
Bingo!

…Wait, hold on. Don’t steal my line!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Hinata %}
Sorry, sorry. It’s pretty much your catchphrase at this point, so it’s left an impression on me.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora %}
Well, that’s ‘cuz being a man among men <em>is</em> my ideal image. My determination to reach that ideal is never changing.

…That’s also how I felt when my junior came over to rely on me for somethin’. If someone’s asking me for advice, then I wanna be of help.

Even someone like <em>me</em> has got juniors who look up to me. And if that’s the case, then I’d obviously wanna be a version of myself that doesn’t betray that admiration.

In order to do that… My only choice is to work hard, hone myself, and focus my mind more.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Hinata %}
…………
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora %}
No matter what frustrating or irritating thing happens… There’s nothin’ I can do but absorb every single ounce of my feelings—

And no matter how muddy the path ahead of me gets, no matter how many times I trip and fall on my way there… I still have no other choice but to keep my spirit goin’ and run down the path of effort at full speed, without ever giving up.

……?

Why do you keep goin’ quiet every time I talk today, Hinata-kun?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Hinata %}
So that I can focus on watching you talk like a true man, probably.

But, y’know, if you just tell Anzu-san what you told me right now, I think your passionate feelings would reach her. And then hopefully, that also turns your outfit into something great.

…Well, it’s all just your feelings though; you still haven’t actually come up with a concrete design~♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora %}
Gnh— J-Just so you know, there <em>are</em> things I’m fond of that I wanna add to my outfit, okay!? Like Taishou and tigers and stuff!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Hinata %}
Tigers? Like, saying “roaar~! ♪”?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora %}
Woah!? Hey, it’s cheating to suddenly aim for my sides!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Hinata %}
Ahaha! Not my fault you left an opening~♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora %}
…If you keep laughing, this is what’s gonna happen to ya! Take this!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Hinata %}
Kyaa\~! Tetsu-kun’s about to grab me by his hands\~☆
{% endbubble %}

{% img /img/es/idolstory/idealpath/cg.jpg %}

{% bubble Tetora %}
This is payback. I won’t hold back from chomping you down. ♪

And besides, what I’m imagining isn’t a cute “roaar~! ♪”, but a much cooler, more majestic tiger!

You gotta keep that in mind. Mark my words… I’m definitely gonna grab hold of my aspired, ideal version of myself with my own two hands. ♪
{% endbubble %}

<div class="msr-narration">
    <p>At a later date…</p>
</div>

{% img /img/es/idolstory/idealpath/4.jpg %}

{% bubble Tetora %}
…And that’s why, I opened a second meeting: all to tell you how I feel.

Well, it’s only you and me participating, but yeah. I’ve now told you every single feeling and thought I had inside me.

Although, I feel kinda bad that in the end, I can only really say that I want a cool-looking outfit that represents my passionate feelings…

……“Isn’t there something else you want to tell me deep down”? You’re real perceptive, Anego.

—Truth is, I did think up one tiny li’l thing… Somethin’ I might want in my outfit.

Erm, I dunno if it’s okay to have this done for my personalized outfit, but… I’d like you to make my outfit into somethin’ just a li’l too big for the current me.

An outfit that looks a bit more mature, or somethin’… Anythin’ works. That way, when I wear it, I’ll feel like I can keep workin’ harder and harder ‘til I become a version of myself that matches the outfit.

Erm… So, yeah, I guess I’d like you to make it an outfit I could grow bigger and stronger into…?

Huh? You’ll think it over?

“I’ll try my best”…? Thank you very much, Anego!

All sortsa things happen in my life every day, but… I’ll make sure I become a man among men, while fueling myself through every single one of my life events.

I’ll let my personalized outfit influence me to continue becoming a great man. So please, keep watching over me…!
