Huh…? Is that Anzu-san over there…?

Ahh, it really was Anzu-san… I haven't been seeing you around lately, so this kinda feels like old times…

Long time no see, Anzu-san…♪

              They said it'll be a joint live with other units, but I wonder how that'll turn out…

              Mashiro-kun and Shino-kun are in my class, so maybe I'll do just fine with Ra*bits…?

{% bubble Midori sighfrown %}
What is it? Ahh, you want to know if we decided on a costume…?

We haven't decided on anything yet… We literally just started, if anything…

But if this were the usual, Morisawa-senpai would've gladly told us lots of ideas… More specifically, he would've pushed his opinions on us…

              Mm, you could just make a mascot character related to Halloween…?

              A costumed character, maybe… A soft, droopy looking one…?

              Yeah, what I truly want isn't to wear it, but to be surrounded by costumed characters.

              Sengoku-kun is pretty tiny, so anything would suit him… Ahh, just imagining it feels like I'm in heaven…♪

              Tetora-kun and Sengoku-kun say that's the usual for him, but…

              It sounds like something happened between Mashiro-kun and Shino-kun… They were acting tense around each other in the meeting, too…

              Please do something about it, Anzu-san… When things are tense all the time, I get just as depressed…

              "Is it a lot to carry"…? It wasn't really heavy at all, actually…

              There's a mascot cushion inside, so maybe that's why it looks so bulky…♪
