Ah, there she is… Anzu-san…!

*Huff, huff…* I'm so glad I finally found you…

Ughh, why is this school so freakishly huge…

              Huh? There was a problem, so you were dealing with it…?

              Uu~ Just the thought of it sounds like a real pain… Thank you for your hard work, Anzu-san…

              The truth is, I have a request… Ah, but before that, did you see Tetora-kun anywhere…?

              He said he found you, and ran off somewhere…

              Ugh, now I have to go all over the place to find Tetora-kun next… Can I just leave that one alone…?

              Anzu-san… You're surprisingly quick, like it's hard to catch you in time, aren't you…

              Sengoku-kun got excited though, saying that you're "exactly like a ninja"…

              There's a huge monitor in the AV room, right…? Could you please give us permission to borrow it…?

              I'm sorry for asking during a busy time… But it's easier to ask you than a teacher, so…♪

{% bubble Midori %}
Is there something vibrating…? Ahh, it was Anzu-san's phone…

Are they calling for you again? It sounds so rough, needing to go from one place to another…

I got carried away talking a bit, but… I should go back to everyone else, too…

              Though now that I think about it, sleeping over and practicing for two weeks is harsh stuff…

              Uu… I don't think I'll make it through unless you draw for me something, Anzu-san…

              I'll be fine, probably… My motivation isn't *that* low or anything.

              If anything, it's Morisawa-senpai who seems out of it, so please come check up on him…

I can't decide if the past two weeks felt long, or if they went by in a flash…

              Well, I was able to enjoy the practice sessions way more than I expected… Or rather, it was pretty easy on me…?

              We're jiangshi, so I didn't need to do any difficult moves…

              But… I wish I could've worked hard without using up so much energy…

              It really makes me realize just how amazing Shinkai-senpai is… He maintained his usual self while backing-up for all of us…
