{% img /img/es/eventstory/sweethalloween/sweethome7_1.jpg %}

{% bubble Nazuna sigh %}
Ahhh, I’m exhausted… Having t’prepare everythin’ *and* practice is justoo much…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Madara %}
Hahaha, you’re slurring your words, Nazuna-san.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Nazuna sigh %}
Nnnn… I godda concentrate to talk right… Now that we’re done, we don’t hafta focus anymore, so 's fine…
{% endbubble %}

{% img /img/es/eventstory/sweethalloween/sweethome7_2.jpg %}

{% bubble Chiaki mgn %}
~……♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Nazuna curious %}
Nn— Oh? Chiaki-chin, you’re reading a book? I didn’t ‘spect something like that from you~♪ So you got bad eyesight? The glasses made me think you were someone else…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Madara %}
Yeah, he wears glasses during class, too. You’re in class B, so you didn’t know that, huuuh?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Nazuna yawn %}
Wow, really… Seeing a whole ‘nother side to someone is part’a what’s so greatabout sleepovers, huh… <em><th>(yawns)</th></em> ♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki mgn %}
Heheh, that was a big yawn just now, Nito. You can go ahead and sleep if you’re tired.

Since it isn’t even 10 PM yet, and the rest of us are still awake, you may have to sleep with the lights still on.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Nazuna yawn %}
Mm, mm~… Yeah, maybe I will… I wanted to stay up and watch over the kids, though…

But… my eyes keep closing all on their own… <em><th>(yawns)</th></em> ♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki mgn %}
Do you always sleep around this time, Nito?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Nazuna frown %}
Yeah, I got'a habit of sleeping an’ waking up early… My dad always leaves for work real early, so I ended up followin’ along…

An’ like they always say, “sleeping is what helps a kid grow.”
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki mgnawkward %}
It kind of seems like you’ve finished growing, though… You still look the same as you did in our first year. You’re so small that I sometimes forget you’re my age.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Madara %}
Yep. Standing next to each other, you and I would look like a parent and their kid, Nazuna-san. So c’mooon, go ahead and call me Mama~♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Nazuna sleep %}
zzz…zzz…♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Madara %}
Ohh? He fell asleep… Oh well, I’ll carry him to his futon~♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki mgn %}
His is next to mine, Mikejima-san. Let’s tuck him in and let him sleep.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki mgnsrsthinking %}
He probably won’t be able to sleep well with the lights on, so maybe I should turn off the lights on this side of the room and move somewhere else…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Madara %}
Yep! You’re doing a greaaat job, being considerate like that, Chiaki-san! Bravo, bravo~! ♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki mgnidle %}
You should be more considerate, too. You’re too loud…

Though, we had a pretty rough day today, yet you don’t seem to be tired at all… That’s pretty impressive.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Madara %}
Are *you* tired? Actually, you don’t seem as energetic as usual in general. You alright?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki mgngrin %}
Yep. You don't need to worry, I’m in perfect shape.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Madara %}
Ahh, in that case, that can only meaaan… O<em>ho,</em> you still can’t stand *that*, can you?

Don’t worry. If *that* ever shows up, I’ll beat it to a pulp~♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki mgn %}
…You really are incredible, Mikejima-san. You can even expel spirits?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Madara %}
I know how. I also know how to ward off *that*.

It’s juuust like the shadow mentioned in psychology.[^1] It’s an illusion caused by anxiety or fear.

Sooo you should make sure to be in a happy, good mood. C’mooon, don’t read a book; let’s go play a board game with the kids~♪
{% endbubble %}

{% img /img/es/eventstory/sweethalloween/chiakiorigcg.jpg %}

{% bubble Chiaki mgnsweeth %}
I’ve made it a habit to read something before I sleep, but… yeah, alright. I can always read some other time.

Let’s try to spend some time with them without disturbing Nito’s sleep. Getting closer to everyone is also another objective of this sleepover party.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki mgngrin %}
My beloved comrades! What are you all doing over in that corner? Let us take part in it, too~♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori worried %}
Eughhh, here comes the loud one…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Hajime smile %}
Heheh, but it’d be a shame to only be around our yearmates, wouldn’t it?

We should all get along with each other while we have the chance. Please come over here~♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mitsuru %}
Mike-chan-senpai, you sit over here! It’s the farthest spot! 'Cuz you’d be in the way if you were in the front!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Madara awkward %}
“In the way” is a mean way to put it… Uhh, sooo what're you all doing? There’s cushions here to sit on… Are you guys gonna start telling stories?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Hajime %}
Oh, no. We’re going to be watching horror movies together~♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki mgnsurprised %}
Horr—…!? Huh!? Why're you…!? It isn’t the season for ghost stories anymore[^2], and if you watch horror movies now, you won’t be able to sleep!

Besides, uh, there’s no TV in the dojo! So you can’t watch a movie, right!?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori norsmile %}
That’s not a problem, I brought over everything we need…

There was an extra monitor in the AV room, right? I got permission from Anzu-san to use it…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki mgncryalmost %}
Gahhh!? You really are amazing, Takamine…! So kind and strong…!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Madara northinking %}
Oh yeaaah, I haven’t seen Anzu-san around…

I wonder if she’s doing alright… Well, it’s not like we can ask a girl to come and sleep over with us, though.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora %}
Anzu-Anego went home after working for as long as she could for the day.

Trickstar are usually the ones to walk her home, but lately she’s been getting a ride home from her parents.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Madara frown2 %}
I see… Sounds like she’s compleeetely focused on her work… I wish she’d join in on the fun, though.
{% endbubble %}

## Chapter 8

{% img /img/es/eventstory/sweethalloween/sweethome8_1.jpg %}

{% bubble Madara curious %}
Anyway, that aside… Why a horror movie? How about we watch something we can aaall enjoy instead, like an action movie?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki mgngrin %}
Y-Yeah! I like that idea! Let’s watch *Ganbare Robocon* or something! It’s really heart-warming!!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tomoya %}
But we’re going to be participating in Halloween Party, right? And Halloween’s all about dressing up as ghosts and monsters.

So we’ll watch horror movies to take note of how to act more monster-like.

Us Ra*bits do stuff like this often so we can take notes on how to do things.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mitsuru blushjoy %}
Yeah, yeah! We watch a lotta stuff with animals in it! Not much happens in them, though, so I get sleepy watching them! ♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori v2 %}
Yeah, aren’t *you* the one who always forces us to watch tokusatsu shows so we can learn how to act more “heroic,” Morisawa-senpai…?

It’s the same as that… What, do you have a problem or something?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki mgngrin %}
N-No? Nope, none at all! Quite the opposite! It’s wonderful how you’re all putting so much work into it!

But you know, no one would scold you if you choose to play around and chat with each other instead! It’s your free time, after all!

Why, Kanata went off to feed the fish in the fish tanks instead of hanging out with us! Y'know, those fish tanks in the Marine Life Club room…! Yeah, those!!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Hajime awkward %}
Wawa— Morisawa-senpai, shhh\~♪ I think Nii\~chan is asleep, so please keep your voice down.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki mgnsrsthinking %}
Ah! Yeah! My bad! I-I think I’ve gotten sleepy, too! Can I go ahead and get some rest? Is it okay if I do that!?[^3]
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori smileconfident %}
Oh no no… Don’t be like that\~ Let’s all watch the movie together…♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki mgnshocked %}
T-Takamine? Your face looks mischievous! Why is that!? Did I do something to make you angry again!?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shinobu curious %}
…? Umm~ What shall we start with?

I brought over the DVDs — I mean, the reference material from the AV room and the library.

There are all kinds of movies in here, including western ones. Perhaps we should pick whichever one looks the best.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shinobu v2 %}
But, well… if we watch a few movies every night, we will probably get through all of them.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki mgnworried %}
E-Every night? We’ll be watching horror movies every night? Will we be alright? Won’t we die?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora awkward0 %}
No one’s ever died from watching horror movies…

Ah— But this one says that it’s not a movie for the weak-hearted.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Hajime %}
Wah— It really does look scary… I’m kind of okay with gory scenes, but I can’t handle jumpscares.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
Shino-kun, do you watch horror movies often…?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Hajime %}
Well, not that often~♪ My little brother seems to like them, so he rents a few sometimes.

He likes them, but he’s also scared of them, so he clings to me whenever we’re watching one.

Heheh, my brother has been kind of rebelling against me, but sometimes he acts spoiled around me~♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki mgngrin %}
A-Alright then! You’re going to need popcorn and drinks for a movie, right! I’ll go get some from the convenience store!

Go ahead and start the movie without me!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora v2 %}
Ah! We’ve got all the stuff we need already! Look, we bought all kinds of drinks and snacks!

We’ve got a special spot right here just for you seniors, so just relax and enjoy the movie~♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki mgncryalmost %}
Gahhh!? Oh Nagumo…! You’re such a good boy…!!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mitsuru sad2 %}
Mmm… We shouldn’t drink stuff and eat snacks around this hour, y'know? My mom always scolds me about that!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Madara %}
Hahaha, we *are* idols, so we should avoid eating too many snacks, buuut…

It’s nothing to scold someone over, sooo… I think it’s fine if you all eat as much as you like.

You should give it up, too… Or rather, you should just buckle up and try your best to enjoy yourself, Chiaki-san.

It might be rough, buuut… you may be able to overcome your weaknesses if you can get used to them, y'know?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori curious %}
Weaknesses…? So Morisawa-senpai really is bad with scary stuff…?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki mgngrin %}
O-Of course not! There’s nothing a hero’s afraid of! Ahh, I’m so excited\~! We’re going to watch a horror movie\~! Come on, let’s get the movie started!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shinobu curious %}
Taichou-dono, your eyes are twitching, you know…?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Hajime %}
Okay, I’ll put the DVD in, then. This Halloween-themed movie is just what we need, so we’ll start with it~♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki mgnhorrified %}
Eeeek!! I heard a strange noise! Something’s making a scratching sound!!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Hajime curious %}
…? That’s just the sound of the DVD player reading the disc…?
{% endbubble %}

## Chapter 9

{% bubble Kanata v2 %}
i am back~♪

…? things are quite [lively] here~ it is [midnight] by now, so you are going to [disturb] the neighborhood, you know?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Nazuna frown2 %}
…………
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata surprised %}
…fwah? i-i am so sorry! i was looking [away] and bumped into you!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Nazuna sad2 %}
Mm~… It’s ok. You’re big, so you didn’t see me sitting.

What do I gotta eat to be that tall? I’m so jealous…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata v2 %}
[fish]\~ you should eat [fish], nazuna\~♪

the reason why you do not grow taller, and why [governments] become [corrupt], and why flowers do not live for [long] — it is all due to not eating [fish].
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Nazuna yawn %}
Mmm? Sorry, I’m still half-asleep so I dunno what you’re sayin’…

Uuu… I was this close to getting a good night’s sleep when I was suddenly woken up… My head feelso heavy…

Ahh, jeez… What’s this whole ruckus 'bout?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata curious %}
hmm~? they are watching a [movie], i think…?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora shocked %}
Ahhh!! No, don’t go in there! That door’s bad news!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Hajime worried %}
Run away~!! That room’s filled with zombies!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mitsuru surprised %}
Gwaah!? Hajime-chan, don’t cling to me! It’ll be okay! Michael got himself a pistol!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shinobu v2 %}
Mhm, mhm! I am sure that Michael-dono will not surrender to these zombies! He seems to be a descendant of ninjas, after all!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Hajime frown %}
But he’s already shot the gun a few times now, does it still have enough ammo?

Please run away, Michael-san! Your lover Judy-san is waiting for you in your hometown~!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tomoya northinking %}
If you think about it meta-wise, since they were just talking about his past with his lover and all… it feels like he’s probably gonna die soon.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori serious %}
Yeah, I totally know what you mean… That's how you know the character's gonna die…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki mgnworried %}
H-He won’t die, right!? He survived this long! You’re just lying when you say he’s gonna die, right!?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Madara %}
Hahaha, I’ve watched this movie before, so I know what happens. Buuut I’m not gonna ruin the fun! No spoilers allowed~♪

Don’t worry, don’t worry! In fiction, the good guys almost aaalways win!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki mgnshocked %}
R-Really? Can I really believe in that?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki mgnhorrified %}
Ahhh… Uh…Oh no—Eeeeeek!! He really did dieeeeeeeee!!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Hajime worried %}
Ah…! Ahhhh!? Noooooooo!!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mitsuru frown2 %}
H-Hajime-cha… I can’t breathe—It hurts…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tomoya glare %}
Hajime… Mitsuru looks in pain, so if you wanna cling to someone, cling to me.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tomoya sad4 %}
I-It’s fine if you don’t want to, though…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Hajime sad %}
Huh…? Um…? I-It isn’t that I don’t want to…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori smileconfident %}
Heeey, Morisawa-senpai…?

Come on out from under your blankets\~ You’re being rude to the movie makers by missing out on the climax, y'know\~? ♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki mgnfrownshake %}
No! It’s scary! I don’t wanna see any more blood and guts!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori smileconfident %}
You always force *us* to watch hero stuff when we never even wanted to, though…?

So there’s no reason why *you* should be the only one to get away with saying that, right…?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki mgnsad2 %}
U-Uuu! It hurts when you say that!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori norsmile %}
<em><th>(whispering)</th></em> So you really *are* bad with horror, Morisawa-senpai… That’s why you don’t seem to like Halloween either, right…? Since it has lots of monsters…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki mgnscold %}
Uuu~? No, you’re wrong! I’m fine! Horror movies don’t scare me one bit!
{% endbubble %}

{% img /img/es/eventstory/sweethalloween/midoriorigcg.jpg %}

{% bubble Midori swthlwocg %}
Then why exactly are you tugging on my sleeve and shaking in fear…?

Wait a sec… Didn’t you yell “It’s scary!” just now…?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki mgnscold %}
N-N-No! You misunderstand, Takamine! *“Sca-ree”* in Swahili means “really interesting”![^4]
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori swthlwocg %}
In *Swahili*…? I can’t *wait* to see what your next excuse will be…♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori serious %}
Anyway, there really isn’t anything to be embarrassed about… We all have things we can’t stand…

In a way, it’s more embarrassing and uncool to keep insisting that you like something you actually hate…

It’s natural to have dislikes… Just be true to yourself… Aren’t *you* the one who’s always telling me stuff like, “I love you no matter what”…?
<!--	好き嫌いがあって当然、ありのままの自分でいい……。どんなおまえでも愛してる、みたいなこと、いつもあんたが言ってるんじゃん……-->
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki mgnangry %}
…? What was that, Takamine? Sorry, I can’t hear you very well from under all the blankets!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori yare %}
Never mind… It wasn’t anything important, so please don’t worry about it…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata curious %}
midori~? that [pufferfish]-looking thing next to you… is that chiaki?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori idle %}
Ah, welcome back, Shinkai-senpai… Don’t walk around outside for too long…

Well, you were only strolling around the school, so I guess nothing bad would have happened to you, anyway…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata v2 %}
fufu, i am sorry. did i [worry] you?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori frown %}
Mm~… It’s not really about me… It feels like Morisawa-senpai gets really anxious without you around…

So please don’t just disappear out of nowhere…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata smileconfident %}
fufufu, that is because chiaki is more [spoiled] than you would expect.

but it looks like it will be okay, since it seems like midori is [protecting] him.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata grin %}
or actually, because everyone in ryuseitai is supporting chiaki…

there is not a single scary thing in this whole [world].
{% endbubble %}

## Chapter 10

{% img /img/es/eventstory/sweethalloween/sweethome10_1.jpg %}

<div class="msr-narration">
    <p>The next day…</p>
</div>

{% bubble Tomoya sleep %}
zzz…zzz…♪
{% endbubble %}

{% img /img/es/eventstory/sweethalloween/hajimeorigcg.jpg %}

{% bubble Hajime smile %}
…………

…Tomoya-kun, it’s morning.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tomoya sleep %}
Mmm… zzz…♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Hajime smile %}
Tomoya-kun! It’s the morning~!! Please wake up!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tomoya surprised %}
…Mmgaah!? Ah, huh? Huh, what?

W-Why is Hajime…? Morning! Ah— Ohhh, that’s right, we slept at school…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Hajime %}
Heheh, you’re still half-asleep.

…Could we talk for a bit?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tomoya curious %}
Uh? Uhhh…? Huh? Where’s everyone else?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Hajime %}
Hm, Mitsuru-kun and Mikejima-senpai said they have a daily routine of running in the morning, so they went off to do that.

Morisawa-senpai, Tetora-kun, and some other people joined them, as well.

Nii~chan and the others are making breakfast.

I was helping them out with that, but you still hadn’t woken up, so I came over to see how you were doing.

Ehehe. I didn’t expect you to be such a sleepyhead, Tomoya-kun.

You were rarely ever late to school when we were in middle school, so I didn’t think you were bad with mornings.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tomoya yare %}
Mmm… It’s just ‘cause I didn’t wanna be late, that’s all. I’d stand out if I were late to class.

Idols are all about making money by standing out, but I still can’t get myself to stop feeling like just another ordinary person.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Hajime %}
I think it’s fine. That’s just like you… <em><th>(nibble, nibble)</th></em> ♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tomoya surprised %}
Hajime? Why're you trying to eat my hair?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Hajime curious %}
Ah— You had some hair sticking out, so I thought I could lick it down.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tomoya glare %}
You seriously act like an animal sometimes… I can fix my hair by myself, and it startles me to suddenly have someone bite at my hair, so could you not do that?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Hajime %}
Okay.  …If I ever do something you don’t want me to do, please tell me.

Actually, please tell me what’s okay to do, and what isn’t.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Hajime sad4 %}
I'm sure you already know this, but… I’ve always been unable to do anything properly.

I could never really do things that other people could normally do, like swinging on monkey bars…[^5]

I was always so slow… People would get tired of waiting, and leave me behind…

And I would always try my hardest to catch up to those people.

But Tomoya-kun, you were the only one who waited for me.

Not just that… You even gently took me by the hand and walked with me.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tomoya sad %}
Hajime… No, you’re wrong. I’m not that good of a person.

You couldn’t do anything easily, so I got cocky about how I could help you out. I’ve actually got so little in me.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Hajime serious %}
That’s just fine, though, Tomoya-kun.

I couldn’t do anything to help anyone, so being able to satisfy your heart was ten times better than that.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Hajime sad2 %}
But when I joined Yumenosaki… what was the norm to me just collapsed. It changed entirely. People would compliment me, enough to surprise me…

Enough to completely baffle me. Even though all I did was sluggishly do things other people could easily do—

They’d praise me with words like, “Nice job,” “You’re amazing,” “Good boy”.

And lately, I even get told I’m cute… Even though, from the way I see it, I haven’t actually changed.

But it made me happy. Everyone used to be fed up of how slow I was, after all.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Hajime sad3 %}
I kept getting complimented, and people thought good things about me… It made me want it more and more.

That’s why… Ever since my pair lesson with Tori-kun[^6], I kept thinking about how I wanted to aim to be cute… How I wanted to be even more cute…

About how I wanted to be praised more…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tomoya serious %}
You don’t have to rush yourself so much, y'know?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Hajime frown2 %}
No, I have to. I’m much slower than everyone else. I’m far behind, so I have to hurry and catch up.

I want to keep working harder and harder… so I can grow to become a strong, great idol.

Strong enough to walk while carrying you… Even when you’ve had to stop from indecision.

That’s my dream right now.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Hajime serious %}
You know, Tomoya-kun… I wasn’t really interested in idols.

I simply just loved you and didn’t want to separate from you, so I followed after you without a second thought.

But it’s different now.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tomoya serious %}
…………
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Hajime sad4 %}
I-I’m sorry that I can’t talk about it properly. I’m making no sense, aren’t I?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tomoya serious %}
Mmm… How many years do you think I’ve been your friend? I can understand what you’re saying no matter what.
{% endbubble %}

## Chapter 11

{% bubble Tomoya smile %}
…Yeah. You’re strong now. I don’t need to lead you by the hand anymore.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Hajime sad2 %}
I don’t know if that’s really true…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Hajime serious %}
But… Tomoya-kun. It’s my turn this time. I’m going to lead you by the hand for all the times you’ve done the same for me.

The future I’m aiming for might be a little different from yours.

After all, you’ve always loved cool idols, not cute ones.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Hajime frown2 %}
So someday, we may end up walking different paths from each other, but…

I want to believe that that “someday” will be far, far away from now… and that no matter what, I shouldn't stop in my tracks.

If there’s a wall blocking your way, then I’ll lead you to an alternate route. We should be able to build some muscle as we’re walking, and we’ll get to experience new things.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Hajime sob %}
So at the very least, while we’re walking together… Please, hold my hand like you always did.

I don’t want to separate from you… I can’t do anything without you… I won’t know what to do anymore, and I’ll start crying in panic… <em><th>(sobs)</th></em>
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tomoya curious %}
…C’mon, don’t cry, Hajime.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Hajime cry %}
Okay. If I ever do something wrong again, please scold me like you did just now.

Please, just be close enough that I can hear you say it… It doesn’t matter which of our hands is doing the pulling, as long as it’s your hand in mine.

Please, I’m begging you, Tomoya-kun… I love you.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tomoya serious %}
…………
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Hajime curious %}
…? Why're you staring at me? Is my hair messed up?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tomoya yare %}
…Nah. I was just thinking how nice it would’ve been if you were a girl.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Hajime worried %}
Huh!? Am I not good enough as a boy?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tomoya sigh %}
No, it’s fine that you are… But if you were a girl, then even though it’s not what you meant, I could’ve mistaken what you said as something else…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Hajime curious %}
Mistaken what I…?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Hajime surprised %}
Ah—! Uu~ When I said I love you, I meant it as friends!!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tomoya %}
Yep. Well, anyway, I just wanna make sure of something real quick. You say you want to be cuter… But that doesn’t necessarily mean you wanna cross-dress, right?

I mean, the thing that started our whole fight was the idea of taking up jobs that would require crossdressing.

It was all 'cause I said I didn’t wanna do it.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Hajime northinking %}
Ahh… Hm, Anzu-san *does* usually want to dress me in feminine clothing, yes.

If that’s what I have to do, then I will. After all, it’s a lot easier to simply make use of the feminine culture that already exists.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Hajime awkward %}
But to be honest, it doesn’t make me feel good… I do want to be cute, but that doesn’t mean I want to be a girl.

You don’t like crossdressing either, right?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tomoya frown %}
I just got something against it a bit, like any guy normally would… But I’m part of the Drama Club, so I’m supposed to take on any role without complaining.

Still… whenever I get pushed into doing something I don’t wanna do, it makes me feel like I'm being told that I'm worthless… I don’t like it.

But eh, I know I’m just being a typical teenager by acting like this.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Hajime %}
Heheh, we *are* high school students, after all. We can’t keep wearing the clothes our parents chose for us.

The expert we take reference from is completely fine with crossdressing, but…

I’m not sure if just copying everything he does is the best choice.

And, like I learned in my pair lesson with Tori-kun, there are a lot of different ways to be cute.

I think we should aim for our very own kind of cute. The cute that suits us.

But for now, we have to focus on the Halloween Party.

We need to decide on a design for a monster costume soon.

We’ll talk it over with each other and find something cute. A “cute” that completely suits us Ra*bits.

Something that’s cute but scary; scary but cute…♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tomoya %}
What’s that supposed to mean? …But you’re right, that *is* what Ra*bits is all about.

We’re lacking in everything, but that’s exactly why we work as hard as we can together, and continue to grow.

We’re not some unit that just does whatever to be cute… No, we’re a unit of hard work. And I’m a part of that unit, as well.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Hajime %}
That’s right, Tomoya-kun. Ra*bits grew this big because of everyone working so hard together.

Tomoya-kun, I don’t like to be tense around you, and I hate the thought of separating from each other…

So if there’s ever something that’s stopping you in your tracks, please feel free to talk to me about it.

I’ll also do my best to speak my own mind.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Hajime awkward %}
I couldn’t really make up my mind on what I should’ve done about our problem this time around… Then things kept getting worse between us, and our time was wasted away just like that…

I really can’t stand how slow I am… I want to properly fight you the next time around.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tomoya frown2 %}
I don’t even *wanna* fight… I seriously didn’t know what I’d do if you hated me… I mean, there’d be no point to living if you did!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Hajime %}
Oh gosh, what are you talking about? You shouldn't relax just yet, anyway, Tomoya-kun. We haven’t *actually* solved everything.

We’re going to keep having moments of frustration. We’ll collide somehow, and may lose our way…

But, I’d like to believe that we can get through each of those moments together.

That’s why… Ehehe, I hope we can keep getting along with each other.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tomoya smile %}
What’re you being so formal for? Well, whatever. Same here. Handshake~♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Hajime smile %}
Handshake~…♪ Ehehe, Tomoya-kun, you really are so warm!

## Translation Notes
[^1]: The shadow Madara talks about is <a href="https://www.orionphilosophy.com/stoic-blog/the-shadow-carl-jung" target="_blank">Jungian psychology </a>. It's a pretty interesting topic relevant to this story and the characters involved.
[^2]: In Japan, the season for ghost stories is typically in summer.
[^3]: He unusually asks for permission with <em>dame kana</em>.
[^4]: Fun fact, Swahili has similar pronunciation to Japanese, hence why Chiaki chose it as his excuse.
[^5]: Originally, Hajime says that he can’t do <a href="https://www.sakaagari-kotsu.com/practice/maemawari-ori.html" target="_blank">this</a> (that other people can normally do), as it's common for Japanese kids to do it. But since that’s not really common in western culture, I changed it to swinging on monkey bars to make it easier to visualize.
