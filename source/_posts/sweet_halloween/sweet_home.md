    <p>The next day…</p>
</div>

{% bubble Chiaki grin2 %}
Now then! Looks like everyone’s changed their clothes, so gather round~! ☆

The meeting for Halloween Party will now commence!

This is a sleepover party between three units: MaM, Ryuseitai, and Ra*bits!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Madara %}
Did you just say “sleepover party”? I guess there isn’t really any other way to put it, buuut…

It doesn’t really feel like we’re here for work when you say that, sooo how about calling it a training camp instead?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki %}
Well, we can call it anything, really.

But more importantly, is your outfit fitting you alright, Mikejima-san? I did try to make sure yours was extra-large, but if it’s still too tight, then please tell me!

I’ll ask Anzu to adjust it for you.

Is yours alright, too, Takamine? You mentioned that you grew taller recently, right?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
Ah, yeah, it’s alright… The outfit’s made of stretchy material, anyway…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora %}
It’s really easy to move in it! Did Anego make these? She’s amazing, doing an awesome job like always! ☆
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki frown %}
Don’t jump up and down so much, Nagumo. There’s a limit to how far your clothes can stretch.

I mean, we *can* fix them if they tear, and there are spares for everyone, but… We wouldn’t want to spend any extra money if we don’t need to.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shinobu curious %}
Huh? But you said we do not need to worry so much about money, did you not?

The school is covering all our expenses for us, correct?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki smilesoft %}
That’s exactly why it’d be wrong of us to make them overspend for us, right?

Besides, we’ll be wearing these outfits all throughout this sleepover par— this training camp, so it’ll end up biting us in the rear if we ruin them.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki yare %}
Think about it: if you accidentally spill some milk on yourself right on the first day, then you’d have the stench on you for the rest of the day.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Hajime %}
Ah, I plan to take these to wash every day. Everyone has a spare, so it’d be most efficient if we switched between the two every day.

If we needed to, we could even change into our gym clothes, or we could bring over a change of clothes from home.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Nazuna %}
Mm~… We’re gonna be in school, so we shouldn’t be walking around in our own clothes.

But I wanna ask, Chiaki-chin… Is there a smaller size than the one I’m wearing right now? My pants are too long.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Nazuna surprised %}
…Woah—Wah—!? Oh no no—!!

Gfhbf—!? Oww—I hit my fwace!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Madara surprised %}
Are you okaaay!?

You tripped on your pants… You’re like a liiittle kid, Nazuna-san~♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Nazuna sad2 %}
Shut it. Uuu\~… I guess I could just roll my pants up if there isn’t anything smaller than this…

It’s really unusual for something prepared by Anzu to be like this… Did she get my size wrong?
{% endbubble %}

{% img /img/es/eventstory/sweethalloween/sweethome1_2.jpg %}

{% bubble Mitsuru %}
Nii\~chan, Nii\~chan! Maybe yours is mixed up with mine? Look, I’m having the opposite problem! It doesn’t reach my feet!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tomoya %}
Hmm? Weird, I’m also having the same problem as Mitsuru.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki %}
Hm, let’s see here. Anzu should have written everyone’s name on the clothing tags.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mitsuru %}
Huh? Where?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tomoya surprised %}
Woah—!! Mitsuru, stop! Don’t tug on my pants!! Everyone’ll see my underwear!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Hajime %}
Heheh, we’re always changing together, so there’s no need to be shy all of a sudden.

Ah— It’s true, there’s something written on the tag.

Hmm… Mm~… I can’t see it very well.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tomoya blushsurprised %}
H-Hajime! Could you please not peek? This isn’t like when we’re changing clothes — It’s just plain embarrassing! Hey—! Seriously, quit staring like that!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Hajime worried2 %}
I-I’m so sorry.

Um… I didn’t see your name written. For some reason, it had a yellow bunny drawn on it instead.

I thought it was weird, so I accidentally stared for a little too long.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Nazuna serious %}
Hm? Mine’s a brown bunny.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mitsuru northinking %}
So’s mine! But it’s kinda darker than Nii~chan’s…?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tomoya curious %}
…Hm, Hajime’s got a light blue bunny.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Hajime surprised %}
Wah— Hold on, please don’t pull on mine! Don’t do anything you wouldn’t want done to yourself! That isn’t very nice!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tomoya glare %}
“That isn’t very nice”? *Seriously*…?[^1]

Ah! Are these our hair colors?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Madara %}
Hm, I thiiink you may be right.

I just checked our spare clothes, and Ryuseitai’s aaall have stars in each member’s respective color.

I wooonder what mine’s got… Is it gonna be Mama?

It’s gonna be Mama, isn’t it, Anzu-san! Even though you were aaalways too embarrassed to call me that~♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata curious %}
…rogue, yours just [says] “mikejima.”
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Madara surprised %}
Huh!? Reallyyy!? I don’t feel any love in mine! Where’s the love, Anzu-san!?

Even when I care for you this deeplyyy\~! Sweet darling daughter, are you rebelling against meee\~!
{% endbubble %}

## Chapter 2

{% bubble Chiaki idle %}
Hm… So what I’m getting from this is that Nito’s and, erm… Mashiro-kun’s clothes are switched?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tomoya %}
Ah, that must be it. Let’s switch clothes, Nii~chan.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Nazuna serious %}
O-Okay. Wait— Then why are *Mitsuru-chin’s* pants not long enough?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mitsuru awkward %}
Huh—? Ah— Uuu…? I bet I messed up and wore yours, too! A-Ahaha! So your legs were short all along, Nii~chan!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Nazuna sigh2 %}
They’re not short, I’m just short in general… I’ve completely stopped growing in size, haven’t I……
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mitsuru surprised %}
G-Growing…!?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Nazuna serious %}
What’s wrong, Mitsuru-chin? You’ve been acting strangely for a while now.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mitsuru worried %}
N-Nothing! All’s good!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tomoya curious %}
…? Hold on, yours had a bunny with your hair color.

So it can’t be Nii~chan’s. Isn’t it actually yours?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mitsuru worried %}
H-Huh? No, um…

Nope, it was just a mistake! It’s actually Nii~chan’s!

It’s a sparkly golden color, just like an angel! Just like the sunlight!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Hajime %}
Ahh, so basically you’re wearing Nii~chan’s spare, right?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki awkward %}
Ahaha… I don’t really get what’s going on, but we’re already having a huge ruckus just from a change of clothes.

Are we really going to be alright…? I’m getting a little worried… But we won’t get anywhere if we keep chatting, so it’s about time we start our program.

We'll start by hanging up decorations in the hallways while it's still daytime, since it’d be a waste of electricity to have to keep the lights on in order to work at night.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Nazuna %}
You're right about that. For practicing, we’d only need to use the lights in one room.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki %}
Yeah. Oh, and we’re going to sleep here in this dojo for the coming nights. I think Kiryu’s going to bring in futons for us later.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora %}
Ossu! When I told him we were looking for a place to sleep in, he gladly told me to use the dojo!

He’s gonna bring over all the stuff we need along with the futons! Maaan, there’s no *way* I could ever thank him enough for all this~! ♪

I expect nothing less from Taishou! He’s bursting with manly chivalry! Truly a man among men~☆
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki %}
You’re extremely happy about this, huh, Nagumo. We’re always indebted to Kiryu, so let’s repay him properly one day.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora %}
Ahaha, the Karate Club takes a break whenever there’s a big DreamFes comin’ up, and the dojo ends up being unused…

So this became the perfect place to sleep in.

We may not have club activities, but we still gotta keep things clean, sooo… Taishou said he’d be super thankful if we could do it for him.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora blushsquint %}
Ahhh man\~! He really is super duper cool\~!

Never demanding rewards from anyone\~! I wanna be like that too! I wanna help someone and act all *“Oh, it’s no problem,”* just like him\~! ☆
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki grin2 %}
Yep, that’s exactly what a hero is, Nagumo.

…Oh, woops, we went off-topic again.

Alright then, let’s start decorating the place.

We’ll split the work between units and decorate bit by bit every day. We’ll hopefully manage to make the entire place look like Halloween by the end of it, and call it a job well done.

I don’t really expect us to finish it all in one day, after all. The academy is huge.

Every little bit helps, so let’s work hard every day with that mindset.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata serious %}
umm… you said the work will be [split] between [units], which means that the rogue will be all [alone].

isn’t it a little too [cruel] to make him work all alone as much as [us]? well… i suppose he [could] manage it, anyway…

but just because he [could] does not mean we should [make] him… it just does not [seem] right.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki %}
Yeah, I thought the same, so I was actually thinking he should mainly work with Ra*bits.

Splitting the work that way will make it fair, since it’ll be between five people on each side.

Ra*bits doesn’t seem like they’d be good at manual labor, so with Mikejima-san’s strength, they should be able to get through their work at the same pace as us.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Nazuna %}
Ahaha, it’s true that we’re not the best at manual labor, but we do a lot of part-time jobs at school, so we’re pretty good at decorating stuff.

Don’t look down on us just 'cause we’re small~!

But it’s all good! Anyway, we really aren’t gonna get anywhere if we keep talking, so let’s get to work. Let’s do our very best, you guys~♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Hajime smile %}
Of course, Nii~chan…♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki %}
Well, we’ve got a lot of work ahead of us, so let’s take it slow and steady, and do our best. There really isn’t any reason to push ourselves, and if we really need to, we could always ask for more helping hands later.

We don't have to try and do everything all by ourselves. *All for one, one for all!*
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Madara %}
That *is* what Ryuseitai’s aaall about. Hahaha, so you’ve managed to make the hollow theme of the past into a reality.

I’m proud of you. You did a great job, yes you did, yes you did~♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki awkward %}
Uuu… Whenever Mikejima-san’s around, it starts to feel like my past seniors came over to hang out… It makes things a little hard to do…
{% endbubble %}

## Chapter 3

<div class="msr-location">
    <p><span><b>Location:</b> Halloween Party Hallway</span></p>
</div>

{% img /img/es/eventstory/sweethalloween/sweethome3_1.jpg %}

{% bubble Shinobu v2 %}
Hup, here we go…♪

Whew! We have now finished decorating this area!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori sigh %}
Mmm… This is taking longer than I thought it would… Feels like we’ve already spent a huge chunk of time just decorating this one section of the hallway…

We probably won’t even get the time to decorate the outside of the building at this rate…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora %}
Uu~myu… The academy *is* pretty big, and for once we’re having guests enter inside the school…

The usual DreamFes just require setting up the stage, though.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shinobu frown %}
It really does feel like this DreamFes will be bigger than ever before.

It seems that we will need to converse with the guests much more than we usually do… I am not sure how I will be able to manage it.

When we are doing work like hero shows, we often come in contact with children, so I have gotten somewhat used to talking to them…

But considering the usual audience for Yumenosaki, the majority will likely be older women.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori sigh %}
Ughh… Just thinking about it makes me depressed…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora %}
Whaa~? Aren’t you used to customers 'cuz of the greengrocer shop?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori sad3 %}
It’s just a local shop, so most of the customers are neighbors I’ve known since I was young…

And even when I’m talking to neighbors, I start dying a little inside if the conversation drags on long enough…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora awkward0 %}
Your heart’s way too weak, Midori-kun… If only we could do workouts for our hearts, too.

…Oh! We shouldn’t be chatting, let’s get back to work~♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shinobu v2 %}
Understood~! Midori-kun, I would like to get down from the ladder, so please move away for a moment.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori smileconfident %}
Ahh, it’s easier if I just carry the ladder with you on it… Up you go…♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shinobu surprised0 %}
Eeeek!? You are managing it so easily…!? You are definitely much more powerful than you seem, Midori-kun!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori idle %}
You’re really light, so… Plus, I’m used to doing manual labor thanks to the greengrocer shop…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora worried %}
Ahhh—! Just watching you carry the ladder’s making me nervous…! He might fall and get hurt!!

It’d be really bad if that happened, so don’t do anything reckless just to get it done faster!

We’ll all regret it if one of us gets hurt and has to sit out on the day of the event…

I wanna be able to say *“The five of us together are Ryuseitai!”* during the actual live show, y'know…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori sad2 %}
Good point… I keep wanting to get the annoying stuff over with as soon as possible, but maybe I should try to take it slow…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki hidden %}
Guh— AAAAAAAAAAH!?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora surprised0 %}
…!? What’s wrong, Taichou!?

I heard a large crashing sound! Are you okay!? Did somethin’ bad happen as soon as I brought it up!?

…? Huh!? I don’t see him anywhere! But he was working with Shinkai-senpai over there just a second ago!

Shinkai-senpai, did you eat him!?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata surprised %}
huh? i do not understand how you reached that [conclusion]…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata yare %}
i would not eat him, you know~ he would probably [burn] my [tongue] if i did.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shinobu v2 %}
Ah, Taichou-dono is being crushed by a box of decorations… Ahaha, he is completely covered in ghosts~♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki frustrated %}
G…G-Ghosts!? No, it’s fine, these are just decorations! It’s not scary! Nope!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shinobu curious %}
…Taichou-dono?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki horrified %}
W-W-W-What is it!? I’m fine! I saw some realistic ghost decorations and freake—
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki shocked %}
No! I mean— I accidentally slipped on some decorations and fell! I wasn’t paying attention!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki grin2 %}
Gotta be careful! You guys should be more careful, too! Fuhahahaha!! ☆
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata serious %}
chiaki~ you look [pale]… if you are feeling [unwell], then please leave the rest to us and take a [break], okay?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki grin2 %}
I-I’m fine, Kanata! I will never give in! I will surely get my chance to turn things around and achieve victory!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata curious %}
[what] are you even [fighting] against…?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori serious %}
Mm~… Hey, is it just me, or is Morisawa-senpai acting weird lately…?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shinobu v2 %}
Is he not always weird?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori srsthinking %}
No, I meant it like… he’s not acting like himself… It’s like he’s always scared of something…

He seems so nervous over everything that he's overwhelmed… He doesn’t even pester me as much as he used to…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora grin %}
Oh? Could it be that you’re feeling lonely\~? 'Cuz he’s not paying attention to you\~♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori angry %}
…………
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shinobu surprised0 %}
Wh—!? What are you going to do with that hammer, Midori-kun!? You could kill someone with that, you know!?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori sad %}
Ah—…… Sorry, I just had this sudden urge to kill… Wow, I’ve seen it before in movies, but… your mind really *does* go completely blank…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora worried %}
You freaked me out! You’re good-looking, so it’s terrifying when you get a serious look on your face! I’m real sorry for teasing you, okay? So please, just spare my life!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori sigh %}
Mm… No, I’m the one who’s sorry… I’m also shocked by my own reaction…
{% endbubble %}

## Chapter 4

{% img /img/es/eventstory/sweethalloween/sweethome4_1.jpg %}

{% bubble Midori curious %}
But no, really… Hasn’t Morisawa-senpai been kinda off…?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora northinking %}
Yeah, now that you mention it… He *has* been a li'l quieter than usual lately.

He hasn’t been his usual positive self… I mean, he didn’t seem pumped up 'bout participating in the Halloween Party, either.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori srsthinking %}
You think so…? Ahh, now that I think about it, he never even mentioned it until you asked him whether we’d be joining it or not, right…?

He’d usually be really excited to get things going, and start poking his nose around in everyone else’s business…

Like, that’s how we got ourselves involved with Quarrel Festival, right…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shinobu frownshake %}
Hmm… Does he not like Halloween very much? Perhaps something bad happened during last year’s Halloween Party…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori idle %}
Huh, but I don’t think there even *was* one in the first place…

Well, it’s not like I know much about anything that happened last year…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori frown %}
But like, my house’s nearby, right…

And while we did do something for Halloween in the shopping district back then, I don’t remember anyone from the academy passing by…

I wasn’t really interested in idols back then, so that probably didn’t help, but… It was impossible to tell what was going on in the academy from the outside…

It felt really closed off from the world…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora yare %}
Hmm… No one ever tells us 'bout what happened in the past even when we ask…

There’s only so much we can assume, too.

It’d just be better to ask him directly.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora curious %}
Hey, Taichou~ Do you hate Halloween?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki grin2 %}
Huh—? Don’t be silly! There’s no way I could hate it!

It’s a day for children, after all! And Ryuseitai are the children’s allies! If the children are happy, then we’ve achieved justice…!!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora sighdrop %}
Uhh… I feel like you’re avoiding the question.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki grin2 %}
No matter! Let’s quit the chatter and start moving our hands!

It’s no surprise that our work has been a bit slow, as it *is* the first day and we aren’t entirely used to it, but I’d like to get to a good place to stop at for the day!

I’ve been keeping in contact with the others every once in a while, and it seems like MaM and Ra*bits have progressed far ahead!

If we keep going at our current pace, it’ll end up looking like we were slacking off!

So let’s do our best! Let's go, we can do it! Put all your energy into it! Fuhahaha!! ☆
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori frown2 %}
Mmm\~…? He really *is* acting weird… Or like, he’s trying really, *really* hard to seem as energetic as possible…
{% endbubble %}

<div class="msr-location">

{% img /img/es/eventstory/sweethalloween/sweethome4_2.jpg %}

{% bubble Madara %}
Hahaha! *A balanced diet leads to a healthy life!* It’s time to cook with Mama!

I’ll make you all something to rejuvenate your bodies and relieve your exhaustion from all of today’s hard work!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Nazuna %}
Ahaha, I’m excited. I’ve heard about what a pro you are at cooking, Madara-chin. This is really helping me out~ 'Cause I don’t really cook much.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Hajime %}
Heheh, cooking food for ourselves really does make it feel like a sleepover party. This is going to be fun~♪

Wawa— My phone’s ringing again. I should’ve put it on silent while we cook.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mitsuru %}
Wahaha! Does your family miss you, Hajime-chan? They keep calling you~♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Hajime awkward %}
Ahaha… The truth is, when I told them I’d be sleeping over for the next two weeks, my entire family clung to me, begging me not to go.

I also miss them, and I keep worrying if they’re all eating well enough…

But there are probably going to be a lot of times when we’ll need to sleep over for work, so they have to get used to things being this way.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Hajime sad2 %}
I have to, as well……

Uuu~ But I want to hear my siblings’ voices just one more time…

{% bubble Hajime smile %}
Hello? It’s your big bro\~ What’s up\~? Yep, I’m doing good…♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Nazuna %}
Ahaha, this is obvious, but you really do talk more casually with your family, Hajime-chin. It feels kinda fresh hearing you talk like that.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mitsuru %}
Yeah, yeah! You can talk casually to us too, you know? After all, Ra*bits is like our own little family!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Hajime worried %}
Huh? What was that? I’m sorry — I can’t hear what you’re saying when I’m talking to someone on the phone~!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Madara %}
Hahaha, it feels reaaally calming just seeing you Ra*bits together.

Buuut aren’t we missing someone? I don’t see Tomoya-san anywhere; where’s he gone to? I’ll go look for him if he’s gotten lost somewhere.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Nazuna serious %}
He’s not a baby, y'know… And anyway, Tomo-chin said it’s his turn to feed the animals at the animal shed, so he’s over there.

Each club take turns feeding them, and right now it’s the Drama Club’s turn.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Madara %}
I see. Speaking of the Drama Club, the two other members seem reaaally busy with their unit activities right now…

Sooo I’m guessing it’s only Tomoya-san who can do the feeding.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Nazuna yare %}
Well, he seems to like animals, anyway.

Maybe that’s why they like him back… There are times when, while we’re trying to go from one place to another, the dogs and cats come over and everyone starts petting them. We don’t get anywhere when that happens.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mitsuru blushjoy %}
Ahaha, it’s one of the benefits of being with Tomo-chan~! ♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Hajime serious %}
…Um, I think it may be too much for Tomoya-kun to feed all those animals by himself, so may I go help him?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Nazuna %}
Hm? Ahh… Sure, go ahead. We already have enough people for all the cooking, anyway.

We finished up with our side of the work pretty early, so we made it here before Ryuseitai, but they’re gonna be here sooner or later.

So go ahead. …You seem to be acting awkward around Tomo-chin, so make sure you talk to him and make up properly.

Tell me if you need a mediator, or any kinda help in general.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Hajime smile2 %}
Okay. Thank you very much, Nii~chan.

I’ll be going now. I’ll come back to help with the cooking as soon as I can, along with Tomoya-kun…♪

Tomoya-kuuun\~ I finished cleaning up this hut here\~♪

Something wrong, Tetora?

Ah, nah… I thought I sensed something nearby, but it was probably just my imagination.

{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora serious %}
Mm~… Hey, Tomoya-kun, I’m not sure if it’s alright to ask, but… Did somethin’ happen between you and Hajime-kun?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tomoya surprised %}
Huh? Where did this come from? Why would you think that?

Did you hear about it from Takamine? I guess I *did* tell him about us fighting…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora grin %}
Oh, so you *are* fighting! I see now\~ That’s great\~! ♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tomoya frown2 %}
No, it isn’t!! Hajime is my oasis~! My heart’s going insane just knowing I can’t talk to him normally!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora %}
Why don’t ya just say that to him, then?

Anyway, I mean that it's a good thing if you know why you’re fighting. It’s way more stressful when things start getting worse and you don’t even know why.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tomoya frown %}
Yeah, true… I feel like you go through that a lot, Tetora… since you’re pretty insensitive.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora surprised0 %}
Woah woah, why'd this suddenly become 'bout criticizing me…!? You’re not holding back at all, huh? The fight must be affecting ya.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tomoya sad4 %}
Ah— S-sorry… I lashed out on you.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora awkward0 %}
Nah, it’s okay. I’m bothered by that part of myself, too. I don’t really like being delicate 'bout things, so I choose to be more straightforward.

I know it’s important to be thoughtful to other people and try to put yourself in their shoes, and to carefully untangle the cause of the fight, but…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora sad2 %}
Uuu~… That kinda stuff just irritates me.

But… While it might feel like a relief to let everything out, you'll just end up hurting that person’s feelings.

So it’s important to be more careful with the people who're gonna be in your life for a long time, right?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora frown %}
But you and Hajime-kun feel *way* too careful around each other; it’s like you’re both holding somethin’ back…

That’s why I want you two to be more harsh and just punch each other.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tomoya yare %}
There’s no way I could do that to Hajime… I’d rather die.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora scold %}
Then what're you gonna do!? Are you just gonna waste time being nervous around each other!? That’s so irritating!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tomoya worried2 %}
C-Calm down, Tetora… Don’t make a ruckus, you’ll scare the bunnies.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora surprised %}
Oh no… Sorry. I came here to help you out, but I’m only getting in your way.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tomoya smile %}
Nah, you’re definitely helping me out. I’d only get a headache from worrying about this on my own, so I’m glad I could talk with you about it.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora %}
Ossu. As long as it wasn’t a bother, then.

Just watching you guys like that makes *me* anxious… or as Midori-kun would say, it makes me feel depressed. I want you two to make up as soon as possible.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tomoya sigh %}
Yeah… Sorry. But, like… this problem’s pretty serious.

I feel like we’ll just end up getting in a fight all over again, even if we tried to apologize and call it a day.

I think it’s 'cause there’s a fundamental difference between how Hajime and I think.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora curious %}
…? Which is…?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tomoya serious %}
Hey, Tetora… Am I cute?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora northinking %}
Hweh? Mm~… Yeah, you are. Cute enough that I forget you’re my age. You look like a li'l kid, which is normally cute.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tomoya sad4 %}
Don’t say “normally”… Okay, would you say I’m cuter than a pretty female idol?

If you could, who would you choose to be your lover?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora curious %}
Uh… Umm… I don’t really get what you mean…?
{% endbubble %}

## Chapter 6

{% img /img/es/eventstory/sweethalloween/tomoyaorigcg.jpg %}

{% bubble Tomoya swthlwocg %}
Like! If I make a cute pose like this! Do you get excited like you would with a cute girl?

This is the best I can do…!! I’m copying this bunny next to me!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora %}
Oh yeah, mimicking an animal’s movement makes sense. That’s the secret behind Kenpo.[^2]

I’ve practiced that plenty of times to grow stronger. Like the Monkey Fist style or the Praying Mantis Fist style~♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tomoya worried %}
Yeah, I don’t really know much about Kenpo, but we often practice copying the kinds of things cute girls or animals do.

Ra*bits is all about being cute idols, after all.

But I just can’t seem to get used to it…

Lately, I haven’t been able to keep up with anything. It made me start feeling pathetic and unsatisfied with myself, and then to top it all off, I even ended up fighting with Hajime…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tomoya sad4 %}
I’ve always wanted to become like the idols I loved — It’s why I came to Yumenosaki. And, well, I *did* get to become an idol.

I got to be a little popular as part of Ra*bits…

So my dream did come true. I'm not supposed to feel unsatisfied like this.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tomoya frown2 %}
But… I didn’t necessarily wanna become a *cute* idol.

I know I’m being selfish… I mean, with the kinds of magazines and companies we get requests from…

We're only going to become more and more specialized in being the perfect ideal of “cute.”

And if we keep going in that direction, the result will be… *this.* Look at my phone for a bit, Tetora.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora curious %}
Hmm? What’s this really pink-ish website…?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tomoya sigh %}
There’s an expert, I guess you could call him… He's like a senior to us. He's an idol who specializes in being cute, so we often take reference from him.

You can pretty much always find him in the same magazine.

But just look at the photos on the site. He's just a girl at this point…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tomoya sad %}
He's actually really amazing. He's put in so much hard work and training, even physically remodeled himself to fit perfectly into this specialty, and it's really respectable, but…

Sometimes we meet him in real life, and when I realize I may have to put that much work in as well… I start to get scared. I know I’m being pathetic…

It just became natural for him to cross-dress, and as long as the outfit’s cute, he'd wear all kinds of things, from baby outfits to animal costumes…

And every single time he does anything, he makes sure it's as cute as it gets.

He's completely gotten rid of everything else to become fully specialized in being cute. It’s what he had to do to get by in the industry, and he's now succeeding 'cause of it.

That's also the methodology that pretty girl idols have set for this sorta industry.

We can follow in his footsteps and copy what he does, and it’ll take us relatively far.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tomoya serious %}
We're still inexperienced, and our one big selling point is the “cute” quality we have… so making use of it is the right choice.

It’s the path Nii~chan showed us, when none of us could get anywhere.

On one hand, you have me, and then you also have Mitsuru, who’s boyish-looking… But then, Nii~chan and Hajime tend to be even cuter than girls sometimes. They have the qualities and talent for this.

But… what about me?

I get so anxious and worried, like “Is this really what I dreamed to be? Am I really the idol I always aspired to become? …Is it really okay for things to be this way?”

I'm always so confused, but… Hajime's been really into this stuff lately. He keeps picking up more and more cutesy things—

And… he's always achieving those cute jobs perfectly.

So he gives me an innocent smile and goes, “If I can do it, then so can you, Tomoya-kun!”, without any ill intention in his heart…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tomoya frown %}
Like, hold on, Hajime… I'm still thinking… Don't rush me. Don't pull me by the hand. I'm not like you…

Hajime’s really cute. He’s the cutest being in the entire galaxy. But it's just so easy to see him as some plain, shy kid that no one noticed how cute he really is until now.

And in Yumenosaki, his talent finally bloomed. He found a way to make the absolute best use of his qualities…

That’s where I feel like the two of us are different.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tomoya sad %}
I don't really know how to say it, but like, it feels like we're a little off. Like something's just not right.

We’ve been walking this path together, and I’ve always tried to lead him wherever we go…

But then we came to Yumenosaki, and now I feel like he’s gonna let go of me and leave me behind all of a sudden.

It scares me. He may be a bit of a dummy, but I'm just someone who's normal in every way… yet despite that, I still took him by the hand…

And then I got all cocky about how I was guiding him around, and let it boost my ego.

But if I can’t keep up with him anymore… if I get abandoned and left behind by him… There’d be nothing left of me.

I wouldn’t have a single good thing left to say about myself.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tomoya frown2 %}
That's why I *should* try as hard as I can to master cuteness like Hajime…

But I really don’t feel like it’s for me.

I spent so much time fretting over it and going around in circles… That Hajime got tired of waiting for me and we ended up fighting… And now we're just dwelling on this whole thing and not making up.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tomoya sigh %}
I'm just being an idiot, aren't I…? But I really just don’t know what to do…

I guess the best thing I can do is just tell Hajime how I really feel and make up with him, but…

Hajime did nothing wrong. It’s all me and my own issues.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tomoya sad2 %}
There’s nothing he should be stressing about at all…

He's really determined for once, but I just feel like I'm burdening him.

He’s doing the things he wants to do with everything he’s got, but I feel like I'm just being dead weight…

I’m scared. I alone want to be his ally, forever and ever. I don’t want to make him cry. I don't ever want to cast a shadow over that gentle smile of his.

Yet right now, I’m the reason why he’s depressed. All 'cause I don’t have the talent for this… all 'cause I'm not determined enough.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tomoya sad3 %}
It frustrates me… I feel so pathetic… I’m not even some *normal* kid at this point. I’m just a waste of space.
