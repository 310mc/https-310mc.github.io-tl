<div class="msr-narration">
    <p>The next day…</p>
</div>

{% bubble Chiaki %}
Now then! Looks like everyone’s changed their clothes, so gather round~! ☆

The meeting for Halloween Party will now commence!

This is a sleepover party between three units: MaM, Ryuseitai, and Ra*bits!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Madara %}
Did you just say “sleepover party”? I guess there isn’t really any other way to put it, but… it doesn’t really feel like we’re here for work when you say that, so how about calling it a training camp instead?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki %}
Well, we can call it anything, really.

But more importantly, is your outfit fitting you alright, Mikejima-san? I did try to make sure yours was extra-large, but if it’s still too tight, then please tell me! I’ll ask Anzu to adjust it for you.

Is yours alright, too, Takamine? You mentioned that you grew taller recently, right?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
Ah, yeah, it’s alright… The outfit’s made of stretchy material, anyway…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora %}
It’s really easy to move in them! Did Anego make these? She’s amazing, doing a good job like always! ☆
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki %}
Don’t jump up and down so much, Nagumo. There’s a limit to how far your clothes can stretch.

I mean, we *can* get them fixed if they tear, and there are spares for everyone, but we wouldn’t want to spend any extra money if we don’t need to.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shinobu %}
Huh? But you said we do not need to worry so much about money. The school is covering all our expenses for us, correct?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki %}
That’s exactly why it’d be wrong of us to make them overspend for us.

Besides, we’ll be wearing these outfits all throughout this sleepover par— this training camp, so it’ll end up biting us in the rear if we ruin them.

Think about it: if you accidentally spill some milk on yourself right on the first day, then you’d have to sleep with the stench later on.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Hajime %}
Ah, I plan to take these to wash every day. Everyone has a spare, so it’d be most efficient if we switched between the two every day.

If we needed to, we could even change into our gym clothes, or we could bring over a change of clothes from home.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Nazuna %}
Hrmm… We’re gonna be in school, so we shouldn’t be walking around in our own clothes.

But I wanna ask, Chiaki-chin… Is there a smaller size than the one I’m wearing right now? My pants are too long.

…Woah—Wah— Oh no no—!!

Gfhbf—?! Oww—I hit my fwace!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Madara %}
Are you okay?!

You tripped on your pants… You’re like a little kid, Nazuna-san~♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Nazuna %}
Shut it. Uugh… I guess I could just roll my pants up if there isn’t anything smaller than this…

It’s really unusual for something prepared by Anzu to be like this… Did she get my size wrong?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mitsuru %}
Nii-chan, Nii-chan! Maybe yours is mixed up with mine? Look, I’m having the opposite problem! It doesn’t reach my feet!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tomoya %}
Hmm? Weird, I’m also having the same problem as Mitsuru.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki %}
Hm, let’s see here. Anzu should have written everyone’s name on the clothing tags.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mitsuru %}
Huh? Where?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tomoya %}
Woah—!! Mitsuru, stop! Don’t tug on my pants!! My underwear’ll be seen!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Hajime %}
Hehe, we’re always changing together, so there’s no need to be shy all of a sudden.

Ah— It’s true, there’s something written on the tag.

Hmm… Hrnn… I can’t see it very well.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tomoya %}
H-Hajime! Could you please not peek? This isn’t like when we’re changing clothes— It’s just plain embarrassing! Hey—! Seriously, quit staring like that!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Hajime %}
I-I’m sorry.

Um… I didn’t see your name written. For some reason, it had a yellow bunny drawn on it instead.

I thought it was weird, so I accidentally stared for a little too long.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Nazuna %}
Hm? Mine’s a brown bunny.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mitsuru %}
So’s mine! But it’s kinda darker than Nii-chan’s…?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tomoya %}
… Hm, Hajime’s got a light blue bunny.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Hajime %}
Wah—Hold on, please don’t pull on mine! Don’t do anything you wouldn’t want done to yourself! That’s not very nice!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tomoya %}
“That’s not very nice”? Seriously…?[^1]

Ah! Are these our hair colors?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Madara %}
Hm, I think you may be right.

I just checked our spare clothes, and Ryuseitai’s all have stars in each member’s respective color.

I wonder what mine’s got… Is it gonna be Mama?

It’s gonna be Mama, isn’t it, Anzu-san! Even though you were always too embarrassed to call me that~♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata %}
… Rogue, yours just says “Mikejima.”
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Madara %}
Huh?! Really?! I don’t feel any love in mine! Where’s the love, Anzu-san?!

Even when I care for you this deeply—! Sweet darling daughter, are you rebelling against meee~!
{% endbubble %}

## Chapter 2

{% img Sweet Halloween - sweet home 2.png %}

{% note location %}
**Location:** Dojo
{% endnote %}

{% bubble Chiaki %}
Hm… So what I’m getting from this is that Nito’s and… Mashiro-kun’s[^2] pants are switched?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tomoya %}
Ah, that must be it. Let’s switch pants, Nii-chan.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Nazuna %}
O-Okay. Wait— Then why *are* Mitsuru-chin’s pants not long enough?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mitsuru %}
Huh—? Ah— Uuu…? I bet I messed up and wore yours, too! A-Ahaha! So your legs were short all along, Nii-chan!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Nazuna %}
They’re not short, I’m just short in general… I’ve completely stopped growing in size, haven’t I……
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mitsuru %}
G-Growing…?!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Nazuna %}
What’s wrong, Mitsuru-chin? You’ve been acting strangely for a while now.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mitsuru %}
N-Nothing! All’s good!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tomoya %}
…? But wait, yours had a bunny with your hair color.

So it can’t be Nii-chan’s. Isn’t it actually yours?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mitsuru %}
H-huh? No, well…

You mistook it as my color, but it’s actually Nii-chan’s!

It’s a sparkly golden color! Just like an angel! Just like the sunlight!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Hajime %}
Ahh, so basically you’re wearing Nii-chan’s spare, right?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki %}
Ahaha… I don’t really get what’s going on, but we’re already having a huge racket just from a change of clothes.

Are we really going to be alright…? I’m getting a little worried…

But we won’t get anywhere if we keep chatting, so it’s about time we start our program.

We'll start by hanging up decorations in the hallways while it's still daytime. It’d be a waste of electricity to have to keep the lights on in order to work at night.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Nazuna %}
You're right about that. And for practicing, we’ll only need to use the lights in one room.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki %}
Yeah. Oh, and we’re going to sleep here in this dojo for the coming nights. I think Kiryu’s going to bring in futons for us later.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora %}
Ossu! When I told him we were looking for a place to sleep in, he gladly told me to use the dojo!

He’s gonna bring over all the stuff we need along with the futons! Maaan, there’s no way I could ever thank him enough for all this~! ♪

I expect nothing less from Taishou! He’s bursting with manly chivalry! Truly a man amongst men~☆
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki %}
You’re extremely happy about this, huh, Nagumo. We’re always indebted to Kiryu, so let’s repay him properly one day.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora %}
Ahaha, the Karate Club takes a break whenever there’s a big DreamFes coming up, and the dojo ends up being unused; so this became the perfect place to sleep in.

We may not have club activities, but we still gotta keep things clean, sooo… Taishou said he’d be super thankful if we could do it for him.

Ahhh man\~! He really is super cool\~!

Never demanding rewards from anyone\~! I wanna be like that too! I wanna help someone and act all *“Oh, it’s no problem,”* just like him\~! ☆
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki %}
Yep, that’s exactly what a hero is, Nagumo.

… Oh, woops, we went off-topic again.

Alright then, let’s start decorating the place.

We’ll split the work between units and decorate bit by bit everyday. We’ll hopefully manage to make the entire place look like Halloween by the end of it, and call it a job well done.

I don’t really expect us to finish it all in one day, after all. The academy is huge.

Every little bit helps, so let’s work hard every day with that mindset.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata %}
Umm… You said the work will be split between units, but… that just means the rogue will be all alone.

Isn’t it a little too cruel to make him work as much as us? Well… I suppose he could manage it, anyway…

But just because he could does not mean we should make him… It just does not seem right.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki %}
Ahh, yeah, I thought the same, so I was actually thinking he should mainly work with Ra*bits.

Splitting the work that way means it’ll be between five people.

Ra*bits doesn’t seem like they’d be good at manual labor, so it’ll be fair on their side. With Mikejima-san’s strength, they should be able to get through their work at the same pace as us.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Nazuna %}
Ahaha, it’s true that we’re not the best at manual labor, but we do a lot of part-time jobs at school, so we’re pretty good at decorating stuff.

Don’t look down on us just cuz we’re small~!

But it’s all good! Anyway, we really aren’t gonna get anywhere if we keep talking, so let’s get to work. Let’s do our very best, you guys~♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Hajime %}
Of course, Nii-chan… ♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki %}
Well, we’ve got a lot of work ahead of us, so let’s take it slow and steady, and do our best. There really isn’t any reason to push ourselves, and if we really need to, we could always ask for more helping hands later.

We don’t have to do everything all by ourselves. *All for one, one for all.*
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Madara %}
That *is* what Ryuseitai’s all about. Hahaha, so you’ve managed to make the hollow theme of the past into a reality.

I’m proud of you. You did a great job, yes you did, yes you did~♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki %}
Uuu… Whenever Mikejima-san’s around, it starts to feel like my past seniors came over to hang out… It makes things a little hard to do…
{% endbubble %}

## Chapter 3

{% img Sweet Halloween - sweet home 3.png %}

{% note location %}
**Location:** Halloween Party Hallway
{% endnote %}

{% bubble Shinobu %}
Here we go…♪

Whew! We have now finished decorating this area!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
Mmm… This is taking longer than I thought it would… Feels like we’ve already spent a huge chunk of time just decorating this one section of the hallway…

We probably won’t even get the time to decorate the outside of the building at this rate…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora %}
Hrmm… The academy *is* pretty big, and for once we’re having guests enter the school…

The usual DreamFes just require setting up the stage, though.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shinobu %}
It really does feel like this DreamFes will be bigger than ever before.

It seems that we will need to converse with the guests much more than we usually do…. I am not sure how I will be able to manage it.

When we are doing work like hero shows, we often come in contact with children, so I have gotten somewhat used to talking to them…

But considering the usual audience for Yumenosaki, the majority will probably be older women.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
Ughh… Just thinking about it makes me depressed…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora %}
Whaa~? Aren’t you used to customers because of the greengrocer shop?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
It’s just a local shop, so most of the customers are neighbors I’ve known since I was young…

And even when I’m talking to neighbors, I start dying a little inside if the conversation drags on long enough…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora %}
Your heart’s way too weak, Midori-kun… If only we could do workouts for our hearts.

…Oh! We shouldn’t be chatting, let’s get back to work~♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shinobu %}
Understood! Midori-kun, I would like to get down from the ladder, so please move away for a moment.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
Ahh, it’s easier if I just carry the ladder with you on it… Up you go…♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shinobu %}
Eeeek! You are managing it so easily…?! You are definitely much more powerful than you seem, Midori-kun!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
You’re just really light… and I’m used to doing manual labor thanks to the greengrocer shop…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora %}
Ahhh—! Just watching you carry him is making me nervous…! He might fall and get hurt!!

It’d be really bad if that happened, so don’t do anything reckless just to get it done faster!

We’ll all regret it if one of us gets hurt and has to sit out during the live show…

I wanna be able to say *“The five of us together are Ryuseitai!”* during the actual live show, you know…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
Good point… I keep wanting to get the annoying stuff over with as soon as possible, but maybe I should try to take it slow…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki %}
Guh— AAAAAAAAAAH?!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora %}
?! What’s wrong, Taichou?!

I heard a large crashing sound! Are you okay?! Did something bad happen as soon as I brought it up?!

…? Huh?! I don’t see him anywhere! But he was working with Shinkai-senpai over there just a second ago!

Shinkai-senpai, did you eat him?!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata %}
Huh? I do not understand how you reached that conclusion…

I would not eat him, you know… He would probably burn my tongue if I did.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shinobu %}
Ah, Taichou-dono is being crushed by a box of decorations… Ahaha, he is completely covered in ghosts~♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki %}
G…G-Ghosts?! No, it’s fine, these are just decorations! It’s not scary! Nope!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shinobu %}
… Taichou-dono?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki %}
W-w-w-what is it?! I’m fine! I saw some realistic-looking ghost decorations and frea—

No! I mean— I accidentally slipped on some decorations and fell! I wasn’t paying attention!

Gotta be careful! You guys should be more careful, too! Fuhahahaha!! ☆
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata %}
Chiaki, you look pale… If you are feeling unwell, then please leave the rest to us and take a break, okay?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki %}
I-I’m fine, Kanata! I will never give in! I will surely get my chance to turn things around and achieve victory!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata %}
What are you even fighting against…?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
Hrm… Hey, is it just me, or is Morisawa-senpai acting weird lately…?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shinobu %}
Is he not always weird?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
No, I meant it like… he’s not acting like himself… It’s like he’s always scared of something…

Like, *really* nervous over just about anything… He doesn’t even pester me as much as he used to…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora %}
Oh? Could it be that you’re feeling lonely\~? Cuz he’s not paying attention to you\~♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
…………
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shinobu %}
Wha—What are you going to do with that hammer, Midori-kun?! You could kill someone with that, you know?!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
Ah—…… Sorry, I just had this sudden urge to kill… Wow, I’ve seen it before in movies, but… your mind really *does* go completely blank…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora %}
You freaked me out! You’re good-looking, so it’s terrifying when you get a serious look on your face! I’m really sorry for teasing you, okay? So please, just spare my life!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
Hrnn… No, I’m the one who’s sorry… I’m also shocked by my own reaction…
{% endbubble %}

## Chapter 4

{% img Sweet Halloween - sweet home 4.png %}

{% note location %}
**Location:** Halloween Party Hallway
{% endnote %}

{% bubble Midori %}
But no, really, hasn’t Morisawa-senpai been kinda off…?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora %}
Yeah, now that you mention it… He *has* been a little quieter than usual lately.

He hasn’t been his usual positive self… I mean, he didn’t seem pumped up about participating in the Halloween Party, either.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
You think so…? Ahh, now that I think about it, he never even mentioned it until you asked him whether we’d be joining it or not…

He’d usually be really excited to get things going, and start poking his nose around in everyone else’s business…

Like, that’s how we got ourselves involved with Quarrel Festival…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shinobu %}
Hmm… Does he not like Halloween very much? Perhaps something bad happened during last year’s *Halloween Party*…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
Huh, but I don’t think there *was* one in the first place…

Well, it’s not like I know much about anything that happened last year…

See, my house’s nearby, right… And we may have done something for Halloween in the district back then, but I don’t remember anyone from the academy passing by…

I wasn’t really interested in idols back then, so that probably didn’t help, but… It was impossible to tell what was going on in the academy from the outside…

It felt really closed off from the world…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora %}
Hrmm… No one ever tells us about what happened in the past, and there’s only so much we can assume, so… It’d be better to just ask him directly.

Taichou~ Um, do you hate Halloween?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki %}
Huh—? Don’t be silly! There’s no way I could hate it!

It’s a day for children, after all! And Ryuseitai are the children’s allies! If the children are happy, then we’ve achieved justice…!!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora %}
Uhh… I feel like you’re avoiding the question.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki %}
No matter! Let’s quit the chatter and start moving our hands!

It’s no surprise that our work has been a bit slow, as it *is* the first day and we’re not entirely used to it, but I’d like to get to a good place to stop at for the day!

I’ve been keeping in contact with the others every once in a while, and it seems like MaM and Ra*bits have progressed far ahead!

If we keep going at our current place, it’ll end up looking like we were slacking off!

So let’s do our best! We can do it! Put all your energy into it! Fuhahaha!! ☆
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
Mmm… He really is acting weird… Or like, he’s just trying really, *really* hard to seem as energetic as possible…
{% endbubble %}

{% img Sweet Halloween - sweet home 4 Scene Change.png %}

{% note location %}
**Location:** Garden Terrace’s Kitchen
{% endnote %}

{% bubble Madara %}
Hahaha! A balanced diet leads to a healthy life! It’s time to cook with Mama!

I’ll make you all something to rejuvenate your bodies and relieve your exhaustion from all of today’s hard work!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Nazuna %}
Ahaha, I’m excited. I’ve heard about what a pro you are at cooking, Madara-chin. This is really helping me out~ Cuz I don’t really cook much.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Hajime %}
Hehe, cooking food for ourselves really does make it feel like a sleepover party. This is going to fun~♪

Wawa—My phone’s ringing again. I should’ve put it on silent while we cook.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mitsuru %}
Wahaha, does your family miss you, Hajime-chan? They keep calling you~♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Hajime %}
Ahaha… The truth is, when I told them I’d be sleeping over for the next two weeks, my entire family clung to me, begging me not to go.

I also miss them, and I keep worrying if they’re all eating well enough…

But there are probably going to be a lot of times when we’ll need to sleep over for work, so I have to get used to things being this way.

I have to……

Uuu~ But I want to hear my sibling’s voices just one more time…

Hello? It’s your big brother\~ What’s up\~? Yeah, I’m doing good\~♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Nazuna %}
Ahaha, so you really do talk more casually with your family, Hajime-chin. It feels kinda fresh hearing you talk like that.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mitsuru %}
Yeah, yeah! You can talk casually to us too, you know? After all, Ra*bits is like our own little family!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Hajime %}
Huh? What was that? I’m sorry—I can’t hear what you’re saying when I’m talking to someone on the phone~!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Madara %}
Hahaha, I really do feel calm just seeing you Ra*bits together.

But aren’t we missing someone? I don’t see Tomoya-san anywhere; where’s he gone to? Should I go make sure he hasn’t gotten lost?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Nazuna %}
He’s not a baby, you know… And anyway, Tomo-chin said it’s his turn to feed the animals at the animal shed, so he’s over there.

Each club take turns feeding them, and right now it’s the Theater Club’s turn.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Madara %}
I see. Speaking of the Theater Club, the two other members seem really busy right now…

So I’m guessing it’s only Tomoya-san who can do the feeding.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Nazuna %}
Well, he seems to like animals, anyway.

Maybe that’s why they like him back… There are times when, while we’re trying to go from one place to another, the dogs and cats come over and everyone starts petting them. We don’t get anywhere when that happens.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mitsuru %}
Ahaha, it’s one of the benefits of being with Tomo-chan~! ♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Hajime %}
… Um, I think it may be too much for Tomoya-kun to feed all those animals by himself, so may I go help him?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Nazuna %}
Hm? Sure, go ahead. We already have enough people for all the cooking, anyway.

We finished up with our side of the work pretty early, so we made it here before Ryuseitai, but they’re going to be here sooner or later.

So go ahead. …You seem to be acting awkward around Tomo-chin, so make sure you talk to him and make up properly.

Tell me if you need a mediator, or any kind of help in general.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Hajime %}
Okay. Thank you very much, Nii-chan.

I’ll be going now. I’ll come back to help with the cooking as soon as I can, along with Tomoya-kun…♪
{% endbubble %}

## Chapter 5

{% img Sweet Halloween - sweet home 5.png %}

{% note location %}
**Location:** Animal Shed
{% endnote %}

{% bubble Hajime %}
(O-Okay, I’m going to do this… I have to properly make up with Tomoya-kun.)

(We’re making Nii-chan and Mitsuru-kun worry… and we have to get through a big event like *Halloween Party* with all three units…)

(So we can’t keep acting awkward around each other like this… It’d be awful of us to cause trouble for everyone.)

(Ra*bits is finally doing incredibly well… It’s almost unbelievable that we first started out as a jumbled mess… We can't just let everything fall apart now. We just can’t.)
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tomoya %}
……
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Hajime %}
(Ah—Tomoya-kun… Okay, this is good. He doesn’t seem to be done feeding the animals.)

(I can speak to him alone.)
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora %}
Tomoya-kuuun, I finished cleaning up this hut here~♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Hajime %}
(Eeep— Huh? Tetora-kun?)

(Why is he here? Did he notice Tomoya-kun at the shed when he and the others from Ryuseitai were on their way to the kitchen?)

(He’s kind and reliable, so he would help him out…)

(But this is bad timing…! Uuu~ What do I do?)
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora %}
……
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Hajime %}
(Wah—?!)
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tomoya %}
Something wrong, Tetora?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora %}
Ah, nah… I thought I sensed something nearby, but it was probably just my imagination.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Hajime %}
(Uuu… I just hid without thinking… I really have no backbone…)

(Tetora-kun may be here too, but I could’ve just told them I’m here to help out…)

(I would’ve been able to do that in any other situation… W-Why am I acting like this right now…?)
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora %}
Hmm… Hey, Tomoya-kun, I’m not sure if it’s alright to ask, but… Did something happen between you and Hajime-kun?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tomoya %}
Huh? Where did this come from? Why would you think that?

Did you hear about it from Takamine? He did say something about us fighting…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora %}
Oh, so you *are* fighting! I see now\~ That’s great\~! ♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tomoya %}
No, it isn’t!! Hajime is my oasis~! My heart’s going insane just knowing I can’t talk to him normally!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora %}
Why don’t you just say that to him, then?

Anyway, if you know why you’re fighting, then that’s a good thing. It’s way more stressful when things start getting worse and you don’t know why.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tomoya %}
Yeah, true… I feel like you go through that a lot, Tetora… since you’re pretty insensitive.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora %}
Woah woah, why did this suddenly become about me…?! You’re not holding back at all, huh? The fight must be affecting you.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tomoya %}
Ah— S-sorry… I lashed out on you.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora %}
No, it’s okay. I’m bothered by that part of myself, too. I don’t really like being soft about things, so I choose to be more straightforward.

I know it’s important to be thoughtful to other people and try to put yourself in their shoes, and to work on settling your differences when you get in an argument, but… urghh… That kinda stuff just irritates me.

But… While it might feel like a relief to let everything out, you might end up hurting that person’s feelings.

So it’s important to be more careful with the people who are gonna be in your life for a long time, right?

But you and Hajime-kun feel *way* too careful around each other… it’s like you’re both holding something back…

That’s why I want you two to be more harsh and just punch each other.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tomoya %}
There’s no way I could do that to Hajime… I’d rather die.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora %}
Then what are you gonna do? Are you just gonna waste time being nervous around each other?! That’s so irritating!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tomoya %}
C-Calm down, Tetora… Don’t make a ruckus, you’ll scare the bunnies.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora %}
Oh no… Sorry. I came here to help you out, but I’m only getting in your way.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tomoya %}
Nah, you’re definitely helping me out. I’d only get a headache from worrying about this on my own, so I’m glad I could talk with you about it.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora %}
Ossu. As long as it wasn’t a bother, then.

Just watching you guys like that makes *me* anxious… or as Midori-kun would say, it makes me feel depressed. I want you two to make up as soon as possible.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tomoya %}
Yeah… Sorry.

But, like… this problem’s pretty serious. I feel like we’ll just end up getting in a fight all over again, even if we tried to apologize and call it a day.

I think it’s because there’s a difference between how Hajime and I think.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora %}
…? Which is…?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tomoya %}
Hey, Tetora… Am I cute?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora %}
Huh? Hrmm… Yeah, you are. Cute enough that I forget you’re my age. You look like a little kid, which is normally cute.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tomoya %}
Don’t say “normally”… Okay, would you say I’m cuter than a pretty female idol?

If you could, who would you choose to be your lover?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora %}
Uh… Umm… I don’t really get what you mean…?
{% endbubble %}

## Chapter 6

{% img (Challenge Zombie) Tomoya Mashiro CG.png %}

{% note location %}
**Location:** Animal Shed
{% endnote %}

{% bubble Tomoya %}
Like! If I make a cute pose like this! Do you get excited like you would with a cute girl?

This is the best I can do…!! I’m copying this bunny next to me!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora %}
Oh yeah, mimicking an animal’s movement makes sense. That’s the secret behind Kenpo.[^3]

I’ve practiced that plenty of times to grow stronger. Like the Monkey Fist style or the Praying Mantis Fist style~♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tomoya %}
Yeah, I don’t really know much about Kenpo, but we often practice copying the kinds of things girls or cute animals do.

Ra*bits is all about being cute idols, after all.

But I just can’t seem to get used to it…

Lately, I haven’t been able to keep up with anything. It made me start feeling pathetic and unsatisfied with myself, and then to top it all off, I even ended up fighting with Hajime…

I’ve always wanted to be like the idols I loved—It’s why I came to Yumenosaki. And, well, I *did* get to be an idol.

I got to be a little popular as part of Ra*bits… so I did make my dream come true. I shouldn’t be feeling unsatisfied like this.

But… I didn’t want to be a *cute* idol.

I know I’m being selfish… I mean, with the kinds of magazines and companies we get requests from, we’re only going to keep getting shaped more and more into the perfect ideal of “cute.”

And if we keep going in that direction, the result will be… this. Look at my phone for a bit, Tetora, just *look.*
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora %}
Hmm? What’s this really pink-ish website?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tomoya %}
There’s an expert, I guess you could call him… He's like a senior to us. He specializes in being cute, so we often take reference from him.

You can pretty much always find him in the same magazine.

But just look at the photos on the site. He's just a girl at this point…

He's actually really amazing. He's put in so much hard work and training and completely remodeled himself to fit perfectly into this specialty, and I can respect that, but…

Sometimes we meet him in real life, and when I realize I may have to put that much work in as well… I start to get scared. I know I’m being pathetic…

It just became natural for him to crossdress, and as long as the outfit’s cute, he'd wear all kinds of things, from baby outfits to animal costumes…

Every single time he does anything, he has to think about whether it's cute or not.

He's had to completely put aside everything else to become fully specialized in being cute. It’s what he had to do to get by in the industry, and he's now succeeding because of it.

Those are the principles female idols have set for this industry.

We can follow in his footsteps and copy what he does, and it’ll take us relatively far.

We're still inexperienced, and our one big selling point is the "cute" quality we have… so making use of it is the right choice.

It’s the path Nii-chan showed us, when none of us could get anywhere.

On one hand, you have me, and then you have Mitsuru, who’s boyish-looking… But then, Nii-chan and Hajime tend to be even cuter than girls sometimes. They have the qualities and talent for this.

But… what about me?

It's so unsettling. I get really worried, like “Is this really what I wished for? Am I really the idol I always aspired to become? … Is it really okay for things to be this way?”

I'm always so confused, but… Hajime's been really into this stuff lately. He keeps picking up on doing more and more cutesy things, and he's always great at it.

So he gives me an innocent smile and goes, “If I can do it, then so can you, Tomoya-kun!”

Like, hold on, Hajime… I'm still thinking… Don't rush me. Don't pull me by the hand. I'm not like you…

Hajime’s really cute. He’s the cutest being in the entire galaxy. But it's just so easy to see him as some plain, shy kid that no one noticed how cute he really is.

But in Yumenosaki, his talent finally bloomed. He found a way to make the best use of his qualities…

That’s where I feel like the two of us are different.

I don't really know how to say it, but like, it feels like we're a little off. Like something's just not right.

We’ve been walking this path together, and in fact, I’ve always tried to lead him on… But then we came to Yumenosaki, and now I feel like he’s gonna let go of me and leave me behind all of a sudden.

It scares me. He’s a bit of a dummy, and I'm just someone who's normal in every way… yet despite that, I took him by the hand…

And then I got all cocky about how I was guiding him around, and let it boost my ego.

So if I can’t keep up with him… if I get abandoned and left behind by him… There’d be nothing left of me.

I wouldn’t have a single good thing left to say about myself.

That's why I should try as hard as I can to master cuteness like Hajime…

But I really don’t feel like it’s for me.

I spent so much time fretting over it and going around in circles… Hajime got tired of waiting for me and we ended up fighting… And now we're just dwelling on this whole thing and not making up.

I'm just being an idiot, aren't I…? But I really don’t know what to do…

I guess the best thing I can do is just tell Hajime how I really feel and make up with him, but… Hajime did nothing wrong. It’s all me.

There’s nothing he should be stressing about at all…

He's really determined for once, but I just feel like I'm burdening him…

He’s going for his dreams with everything he’s got, but I feel like I'm just being dead weight…

I’m scared. I alone want to be his ally, forever and ever. I don’t want to make him cry. I don't ever want to cast a shadow over that gentle smile of his.

Yet right now, I’m the reason why he’s depressed. All because I don’t have the talent for this… all because I'm not determined enough.

It frustrates me… I feel so pathetic… I’m not even some *normal* kid at this point. I’m just a waste of space.

{% bubble Nazuna %}
Ahhh, I’m exhausted… Having t’prepare everything *and* practice is justoo much…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Madara %}
Hahaha, you’re slurring your words, Nazuna-san.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Nazuna %}
Nnnn… I godda concentrate to talk right… Now that we’re done, we don’t hafta focus anymore, so…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki %}
………♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Nazuna %}
Nn—Oh? Chiaki-chin, you’re reading a book? I didn’t ‘spect something like that from you~♪

So you got bad eyesight? The glasses made me think you were someone else…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Madara %}
Yeah, he wears glasses during class, too. You’re in class B, so you didn’t know that, huh?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Nazuna %}
Wow, really… Seeing a whole ‘nother side to someone is part of what’s so greatabout sleepovers, huh… *(yawn)*
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki %}
Hehe, that was a big yawn just now, Nito. You can go ahead and sleep if you’re tired.

Since it’s not even 10 PM yet, and the rest of us are still awake, you may have to sleep with the lights still on.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Nazuna %}
Nnn, hnn… Yeah, maybe I will… I wanted to stay up with the kids, though…

But… my eyes keep closing all on their own… *(yawn)*
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki %}
Do you always sleep around this time?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Nazuna %}
Yeah… My dad always leaves for work real early, so… I got used to that kinda schedule…

An’ like they always say, “sleeping is what helps a kid grow.”
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki %}
It kind of seems like you’re done growing, though… You still look the same as you did in our first year. You’re so small that I sometimes forget you’re my age.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Madara %}
Yep. Standing next to each other, you and I would look like a parent and their kid, Nazuna-san. So c’mon, go ahead and call me Mama~♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Nazuna %}
zzz…zzz… ♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Madara %}
Ohh? He fell asleep… Oh well, I’ll carry him to his futon~♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki %}
His is next to mine, Mikejima-san. Let’s tuck him in and let him sleep.

He probably won’t be able to sleep well with the lights on, so maybe I should turn off the lights on this side of the room and move somewhere else…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Madara %}
Yep! You’re doing a great job, being considerate like that, Chiaki-san! Bravo, bravo~! ♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki %}
You should be more considerate, too. You’re too loud.

We had a pretty rough day today, yet you don’t seem to be tired at all… That’s pretty impressive.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Madara %}
Are *you* tired? You don’t seem as energetic as usual. You alright?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki %}
Yep. You don't need to worry, I’m in perfect shape.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Madara %}
Ahh, that can only mean… O<em>ho,</em> you still can’t stand *that*, can you?

Don’t worry. If *that* ever shows up, I’ll beat it to a pulp~♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki %}
… You really are incredible, Mikejima-san. You can even expel spirits?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Madara %}
I know how. I also know how to ward off *that*.

It’s just like the shadow mentioned in psychology.[^4] It’s an illusion caused by anxiety or fear.

So you should make sure to be in a happy, good mood. C’mon, don’t read a book; let’s go play a board game with the kids~♪
{% endbubble %}

{% img (Horror Jiangshi) Chiaki Morisawa CG.png %}

{% bubble Chiaki %}
I’ve made it a habit to read something before I sleep, but… yeah, alright. I can always read some other time.

Let’s try to spend some time with them without disturbing Nito’s sleep. Getting closer to everyone is also another objective of this sleepover.

My beloved comrades! What are you all doing over in that corner? Let us take part in it, too~♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
Eughhh, here comes the loud one…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Hajime %}
Hehe, but it’d be a shame to only be around our yearmates, wouldn’t it?

So we should all get along with each other while we have the chance. Please come over here~♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mitsuru %}
Mike-chan-senpai, you sit over here! It’s the farthest spot! Cuz you’d be in the way if you were in the front!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Madara %}
“In the way,” he says… Uhh, so what are you all doing? There’s cushions here to sit on… Are you guys gonna start telling stories?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Hajime %}
Oh, no. We’re going to be watching horror movies together~♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki %}
Horro…?! Huh?! Why are you…?! It’s not the season for ghost stories anymore[^5], and if you watch horror movies now, you won’t be able to sleep!

Besides, uh, there’s no TV in the dojo! So you can’t watch a movie, right?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
That’s not a problem, I brought over everything we need…

There was an extra monitor in the AV room, right? I got permission from Anzu-san to use it…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki %}
Gahhh?! You really are amazing, Takamine…! So kind and strong…!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Madara %}
Oh yeah, I haven’t seen Anzu-san around…

I wonder if she’s doing alright… Well, it’s not like we can ask a girl to come and sleep over with us, though.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora %}
Anego went home after working for as long as she could for the day.

It seems like Trickstar are usually the ones to walk her home, but lately she’s been getting a ride home from her parents.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Madara %}
I see… Sounds like she’s completely focused on her work… I wish she’d join in on the fun, though.
{% endbubble %}

## Chapter 8

{% img Sweet Halloween - sweet home 8.png %}

{% note location %}
**Location:** Dojo (Futon)
{% endnote %}

{% bubble Madara %}
That aside… Why a horror movie? How about we watch something we can all enjoy instead, like an action movie?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki %}
Y-yeah! I like that idea! Let’s watch *Ganbare Robocon* or something! It’s really heart-warming!!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tomoya %}
But we’re going to be participating in *Halloween Party*, right? And Halloween’s all about dressing up as ghosts and monsters.

So we’re watching horror movies to take note of how to how to act more monster-like.

Us Ra*bits do stuff like this often so we can take notes on how to do things.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mitsuru %}
Yeah, yeah! We watch a lot of stuff with animals in it! Not much happens in them, though, so I get sleepy watching them! ♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
Yeah, aren’t *you* the one who always forces us to watch tokusatsu shows so we can learn how to act more “heroic,” Morisawa-senpai…?

It’s the same as that… What, do you have a problem or something?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki %}
N-no? Nope, none at all! Quite the opposite! It’s wonderful how you’re all putting so much work into it!

But you know, no one will scold you if you choose to play around and chat with each other instead! It’s your free time, after all!

Why, Kanata went off to feed the fish in the fish tanks instead of hanging out with us! You know, those fish tanks in the Marine Life club room…! Yeah, those!!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Hajime %}
Wawa— Morisawa-senpai, shhh~♪ I think Nii-chan is asleep, so please keep your voice down.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki %}
Ah! Yeah! My bad! I-I think I’ve gotten tired, too! Can I go ahead and get some rest? Is it okay if I do that?![^6]
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
Oh no no, don’t be like that\~ Let’s all watch the movie together\~♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki %}
T-Takamine? Your face looks mischievous! Why is that! Did I do something to make you angry again?!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shinobu %}
…? Um, what shall we start with?

I brought over the DVDs—I mean, the reference material from the AV room and the library.

There are all kinds of movies in here, including western ones. Perhaps we should pick whichever one looks the best.

But, well… if we watch a few movies every night, we will probably get through all of them.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki %}
E-Every night? We’ll be watching horror movies every night? Will we be alright? Won’t we die?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora %}
No one’s ever died from watching horror movies…

Ah—But this one says that it’s not a movie for the weak-hearted.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Hajime %}
Wah—It really does look scary… I’m kind of okay with gory scenes, but I can’t handle jumpscares.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
Shino-kun, you watch horror movies…?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Hajime %}
Yes, but not often~♪ My brother seems to like them, so he rents a few sometimes.

He likes them, but he’s also scared of them, so he clings to me whenever we’re watching one.

Hehe, my brother has been kind of rebelling against me, but sometimes he acts spoiled around me~♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki %}
A-Alright then! You’re going to need popcorn and drinks for a movie, right! I’ll go get some from the convenience store!

Go ahead and start the movie without me!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora %}
Ah! We’ve got all the stuff we need already! Look, we bought all kinds of drinks and snacks~♪

We’ve got a special spot right here just for you seniors, so just relax and enjoy the movie~♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki %}
Gahhh?! Oh Nagumo…! You’re such a good kid…!!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mitsuru %}
Hrnn… We shouldn’t drink stuff and eat snacks around this hour, you know? My mom always scolds me about that!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Madara %}
Hahaha, we *are* idols, so we should avoid eating too many snacks, but it’s nothing to scold someone over, so… I think it’s fine if you all eat as much as you like.

You should give it up, too… Or rather, you should just buckle up and try your best to enjoy yourself, Chiaki-san.

It might be difficult, but… you may be able to overcome your weaknesses if you can get used to them, you know?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
Weaknesses…? So Morisawa-senpai really is bad with scary stuff?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki %}
O-Of course not! There’s nothing a hero’s afraid of! Ahh, I’m so excited\~! We’re going to watch a horror movie\~! Come on, let’s get the movie started!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shinobu %}
Taichou-dono, your eyes are twitching, you know…?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Hajime %}
Okay, I’ll put the DVD in, then. This Halloween-themed movie is just what we need, so we’ll start with it~♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki %}
Eeeek!! I heard a strange noise! Something’s making a scratching sound!!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Hajime %}
…? That’s just the sound of the DVD player reading the disc…?
{% endbubble %}

## Chapter 9

{% img Sweet Halloween - sweet home 9.png %}

{% note location %}
**Location:** Dojo (Futon)
{% endnote %}

{% bubble Kanata %}
I’m back~♪

…? Things are quite lively here… It is midnight by now, so you are going to disturb the neighborhood, you know?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Nazuna %}
……
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata %}
Wah…! I-I’m so sorry! I turned around and bumped into you!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Nazuna %}
Nnnn… It’s ok. You’re big, so you didn’t see me sitting.

What do I gotta eat to be that tall? I’m so jealous…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata %}
Fish\~ You should eat fish, Nazuna\~♪

The reason why you do not grow taller, and why governments become corrupt, and why flowers do not live for long—it is all due to not eating fish.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Nazuna %}
Mmm? Sorry, I’m still half-asleep so I dunno what you’re sayin’…

Uuu… I was this close to getting a good night’s sleep when I was suddenly woken up… My head feels so heavy…

Ahh, jeez… What’s this whole ruckus about?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata %}
Hmm~? They are watching a movie, I think?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora %}
Ahhh!! No, don’t go in there! That door’s bad news!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Hajime %}
Run away~!! That room’s filled with zombies!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mitsuru %}
Gwaah!? Hajime-chan, don’t cling to me! It’ll be okay! Michael got himself a pistol!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shinobu %}
Yes, yes! I am sure that Michael-dono will not surrender to these zombies! He seems like a descendant of ninjas, after all!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Hajime %}
But he’s already shot the gun a few times now, does it still have enough ammo?

Please run away, Michael-san! Your lover Judy-san is waiting for you in your hometown~!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tomoya %}
If you think about it, since they were just talking about his past with his lover and all… it feels like he’s probably gonna die soon.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
Yeah, I totally know what you mean… This guy’s likely gonna die…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki %}
H-He won’t die, right?! He survived this long! You’re just lying when you say he’s gonna die, right!?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Madara %}
Hahaha, I’ve watched this movie before so I know what happens. But I’m not gonna ruin the fun! No spoilers allowed~♪

Don’t worry, don’t worry! In fiction, the good guys almost always win!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki %}
R-Really? Can I really believe in that?

Ahhh… Uh…Oh no—Eeeeeek!! He really did dieeeeeeeeeeeee!!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Hajime %}
Ah…! Ahhhh!? Nooooooooooo!!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mitsuru %}
H-Hajime-cha… I can’t breathe—It hurts…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tomoya %}
Hajime… Mitsuru looks in pain, so if you wanna cling to someone, cling to me.

I-It’s fine if you don’t want to, though…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Hajime %}
Huh…? Um… I-It’s not that I don’t want to…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
Heeey, Morisawa-senpai~?

Come on out from under your blankets\~ You’re being rude to the movie makers by missing out on the climax, you know\~? ♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki %}
No! It’s scary! I don’t wanna see any more blood and guts!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
You always force us to watch hero stuff when we never even wanted to… so there’s no reason why *you* should be the only one to get away with something like that, right?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki %}
U-Uuu! It hurts when you say that!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
*(whispering)* So you really *are* bad with horror, Morisawa-senpai… That’s why you don’t seem to like Halloween either, right…? Since it has lots of monsters…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki %}
Uuu~? No, you’re wrong! I’m fine! Horror movies don’t scare me one bit!
{% endbubble %}

{% img (Natural Jiangshi) Midori Takamine CG.png %}

{% bubble Midori %}
Then why exactly are you tugging on my sleeve and shaking in fear…?

Wait a sec… didn’t you shout “It’s scary!” just now…?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki %}
N-n-no! You misunderstand, Takamine! *“Sca-ree”* in Swahili means “It’s really interesting”!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
In *Swahili*…? I can’t *wait* to see what your next excuse will be…♪

Anyway, there really isn’t anything to be embarrassed about… we all have things we can’t stand…

In a way, it’s more embarrassing and uncool to keep trying to pretend to like something you actually hate…

It’s natural to have dislikes… Just be true to yourself… Aren’t *you* the one who’s always telling me stuff like, “I love you no matter what”…?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki %}
…? What was that, Takamine? Sorry, I can’t hear you very well from under all the blankets!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
Nevermind… It wasn’t anything important, so please don’t worry about it…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata %}
Midori~? That pufferfish-looking thing next to you… is that Chiaki?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
Ah, welcome back Shinkai-senpai… Don’t walk around outside for too long…

Well, you were only strolling around the school, so I guess nothing bad would have happened to you, anyway…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata %}
Hehe, I am sorry. Did I worry you?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
Mmm… It’s not really about me… It feels like Morisawa-senpai gets really anxious without you around…

So please don’t just disappear out of nowhere…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata %}
Hehehe, that is because Chiaki is more spoiled than you would expect.

But it looks like things will be okay, since it seems like you are protecting him.

Or actually… With everyone in Ryuseitai supporting Chiaki, there can be nothing scary in this whole world.

{% bubble Hajime %}
……

… Tomoya-kun, it’s morning.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tomoya %}
Mmm… zzz… ♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Hajime %}
Tomoya-kun! It’s the morning~!! Please wake up!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tomoya %}
…Mmgaah?! Ah, huh? Huh, what?

W-why are you…? Morning! Ah—Ohhh, that’s right, we slept at school…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Hajime %}
Hehe, you’re still half-asleep.

… Could we talk for a bit?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tomoya %}
Uh? Uhhh…? Huh? Where’s everyone else?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Hajime %}
Hm, Mitsuru-kun and Mikejima-senpai said they have a daily routine of running in the morning, so they went off to do that.

Morisawa-senpai, Tetora-kun, and some other people joined them, as well.

Nii-chan is making breakfast. I was helping him out with that, but you still hadn’t woken up, so I came over to see how you were doing.

Ehehe. I didn’t expect you to be such a sleepyhead, Tomoya-kun.

You were rarely ever late to school when we were in middle school, so I didn’t think you were bad with mornings.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tomoya %}
Mmm… It’s just ‘cause I didn’t wanna be late, that’s all. I’d stand out if I were late to class.

Idols are all about making money by standing out, but I still can’t get myself to stop feeling like just another ordinary person.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Hajime %}
I think it’s fine. That’s just like you… *(nibble, nibble)* ♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tomoya %}
Hajime? Why are you trying to eat my hair?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Hajime %}
Ah—You had some hair sticking out, so I thought I could lick it down.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tomoya %}
You seriously act like an animal sometimes… I can fix my hair by myself, and it startles me to suddenly have someone bite at my hair, so could you not do that?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Hajime %}
Okay.  … If I ever do something you don’t want me to do, please tell me.

Actually, please tell me what’s okay to do, and what isn’t.

You probably already knew this, but… I’ve always been unable to do anything properly.

I could never really do things that other people could normally do, like swinging on monkey bars…[^7]

I was always so slow… People would get tired of waiting, and leave me behind…

And I would always try my hardest to catch up to those people.

But Tomoya-kun, you were the only one who waited for me.

Not just that… You even gently took me by the hand and walked with me.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tomoya %}
Hajime… No, you’re wrong. I’m not that good of a person.

You couldn’t do anything easily, so I got cocky about how I could help you out. I’ve actually got so little in me.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Hajime %}
That’s just fine, though, Tomoya-kun.

I couldn’t do anything to help anyone, so being able to satisfy your heart was ten times better than that.

But when I joined Yumenosaki… what was the norm to me just collapsed. It changed entirely…

People would compliment me, enough to surprise me… to completely shock me.

They’d say things like, “Nice job” “You’re amazing” “Good boy,” even though all I did was sluggishly do things other people could easily do.

And lately, I even get told I’m cute… Even though, from the way I see it, I haven’t actually changed…

But it made me happy. Everyone used to be shocked by how slow I was, after all.

I kept getting complimented, and people thought good things about me… It made me want it more and more.

That’s why… Ever since my pair lesson with Tori-kun, I kept thinking about how I wanted to aim to be cute… How I wanted to be even more cute…

About how I wanted to be praised more…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tomoya %}
You don’t have to rush yourself so much, you know?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Hajime %}
No, I have to. I’m much slower than everyone else. I’m far behind, so I have to hurry and catch up.

I want to keep working harder and harder… so I can grow to become a strong, great idol.

Strong enough to walk while carrying you… Even when you’ve had to stop from indecision.

That’s my dream right now.

You know, Tomoya-kun… I wasn’t really interested in idols.

I loved you and didn’t want to separate from you, so I just followed after you without thinking.

But it’s different now.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tomoya %}
……
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Hajime %}
I-I’m sorry that I can’t talk about it properly. I’m making no sense, aren’t I?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tomoya %}
Mmm… How many years do you think I’ve been your friend? I can understand what you’re saying no matter what.
{% endbubble %}

## Chapter 11

{% img Sweet Halloween - sweet home 11.png %}

{% note location %}
**Location:** Dojo (Futon)
{% endnote %}

{% bubble Tomoya %}
…Yeah. You’re strong now. I don’t need to lead you by the hand anymore.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Hajime %}
I don’t know if that’s really true…

But… Tomoya-kun. It’s my turn this time. I’m going to lead you by the hand for all the times you’ve done the same for me.

The future I’m aiming for might be a little different from yours, since you’ve always loved cool idols, not cute.

So someday, we may end up walking different paths from each other, but… I want to believe that that “someday” will be far, far away from now… and that no matter what, I mustn’t stop in my tracks.

If there’s a wall blocking your way, then I’ll lead you to an alternate route. We should be able to build some muscle as we’re walking, and we’ll get to experience new things.

So at the very least, while we’re walking together… Please, hold my hand like you always did.

I don’t want to separate from you… I can’t do anything without you… I won’t know what to do anymore, and I’ll start crying in panic… *(sobs)*
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tomoya %}
…C’mon, don’t cry, Hajime.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Hajime %}
Okay. If I ever do something wrong, please scold me like you did just now.

Please, just be close enough that I can hear you say it… It doesn’t matter which of our hands is doing the pulling, as long as it’s your hand in mine.

Please, I’m begging you, Tomoya-kun… I love you.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tomoya %}
…………
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Hajime %}
…? Why are you staring at me? Is my hair messed up?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tomoya %}
…Nah. I was just thinking how nice it would’ve been if you were a girl.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Hajime %}
Huh?! Am I not good enough as a boy?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tomoya %}
No, it’s fine that you are… But if you were a girl, then even though it’s not what you meant, I could’ve mistaken what you said as something else….
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Hajime %}
Mistaken what I…?

Ah—Um! When I said I love you, I meant it as friends!!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tomoya %}
Yep. Well, anyway, I just wanna make sure of something real quick. You say you want to be cuter… But that doesn’t necessarily mean you want to crossdress, right?

I mean, the thing that started our whole fight was the idea of taking up jobs that would require crossdressing.

It was all because I said I didn’t wanna do it.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Hajime %}
Ahh… Hm, Anzu-san *does* usually want to dress me in feminine clothing, yes.

If that’s what I have to do, then I will. After all, it’s a lot easier to simply make use of the feminine culture that already exists.

But to be honest, it doesn’t make me feel good… I do want to be cute, but that doesn’t mean I want to be a girl.

You don’t like crossdressing either, right?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tomoya %}
I just got something against it a bit, like any guy would… But I’m part of the Theater Club, so I’m supposed to take on any role without complaining.

Still.. whenever I get pushed into doing something I don’t wanna do, I start to feel kinda worthless… I don’t like it.

But eh, I know I’m just being a typical teenager by acting like this.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Hajime %}
Hehe, we *are* highschool students, after all. We can’t keep letting our parents do our work for us.

The expert we take reference from is completely fine with crossdressing, but I’m not sure if just copying everything he does is the best choice.

And, like I learned in my pair lesson with Tori-kun, there are lots of different ways to be cute.

I think we should aim for our own kind of cute. The cute that suits us.

But for now, we have to focus on the Halloween Party.

We need to decide on a design for a monster costume soon.

We’ll talk it over with each other and find something cute. A “cute” that completely suits us Ra*bits.

Something that’s cute but scary; scary but cute…♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tomoya %}
What’s that supposed to mean? … But you’re right, that *is* what Ra*bits is all about.

We’re lacking in everything, but that’s exactly why we work as hard as we can together, and continue to grow.

We’re not some unit that just does whatever to be cute… No, we’re a unit of hard work. And I’m a part of that unit, as well.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Hajime %}
That’s right, we grew this big because of everyone working so hard together.

Tomoya-kun, I don’t like to be awkward around you, and I hate the thought of separating from each other…

So if there’s ever something that’s stopping you in your tracks, please feel free to talk to me about it. I’ll also do my best to speak my own mind.

I couldn’t really make up my mind on what I should’ve done about our problem this time around… Then things kept getting worse between us, and our time was wasted away just like that…

I really couldn’t stand how slow I was… I want to properly fight you the next time around.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tomoya %}
I don’t even *wanna* fight… I seriously didn’t know what I’d do if you hated me… I mean, there’d be no point to living if you did!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Hajime %}
Oh gosh, what are you talking about? Don’t relax just yet, Tomoya-kun. We haven’t *actually* solved everything.

We’re going to keep having moments of frustration. We’ll collide somehow, and may lose our way…

But, I’d like to think that we could get through each of those moments together.

That’s why… Ehehe, I hope we can keep getting along with each other.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tomoya %}
What’re you being so formal for? Well, whatever. Same here. Handshake~♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Hajime %}
Handshake~♪ Ehehe, Tomoya-kun, you really are so warm!

## Translation Notes
[^1]: Hajime’s tone here sounds like parental scolding, hence Tomoya’s retort.
[^2]: The slight pause is likely because he was trying to recall Tomoya’s name.
[^3]: Kenpo is a Japanese martial arts.
[^4]: The shadow Madara talks about is Jungian psychology.
[^5]: In Japan, the season for ghost stories is typically in summer.
[^6]: He unusually asks for permission with *dame kana*
[^7]: Originally, Hajime says that he can’t do [this] (that other people can normally do), as it's common for Japanese kids to do it. But since that’s not really common in western culture, I changed it to swinging on monkey bars.
