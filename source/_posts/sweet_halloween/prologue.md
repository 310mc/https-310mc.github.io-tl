<th>(*Sigh…* I’m not sure what to do now… Why did things turn out this way…)</th>

<th>(I can’t believe I ended up fighting with Tomoya-kun… This has never even happened before…)</th>

<th>(Tomoya-kun has always been so kind and positive towards me… Even though I’m bad at talking, he cheerfully listens to me…)</th>

<th>(He never rejects what I say, and agrees to it with things like “That sounds good” or “Let’s do it together”…)</th>

<th>(He would even hold my hand while walking with me…)</th>

<th>(So why did it turn out this way this time around…? I don’t understand… It’s probably my fault, isn’t it?)</th>

<th>(I must’ve accidentally hit a nerve in Tomoya-kun… I must’ve mentioned something he doesn’t want to discuss.)</th>

<th>(I have to apologize to him… We should be able to understand each others’ feelings if we talk it through.)</th>

<th>(He’s my best friend, after all.)</th>

<th>(But… We can never find the right time, because of our clubs or because of family… And even though we’re classmates, there still hasn’t been the right timing to talk properly to each other.)</th>

<th>(And now time is going by just like that… Uuu, why did this happen…)</th>

<th>(I love Tomoya-kun, and he’s so important to me… So why did we clash against each other…? Why is it that all I can do is mumble my words when I try to make amends with him?)</th>

<th>(I’m just a no good dunce, aren’t I…? It’s like I’ve gone straight back to how I was before I met Tomoya-kun.)</th>

<th>(*Sigh…*)</th>

<th>(What do I do? What do I do? I’m in big trouble.)</th>

<th>(Think, Morisawa Chiaki! Think of a way to break out of this dilemma! Aahhh, I knew this already, but… this wouldn't go like a tokusatsu show would, huh!?)</th>

<th>(This isn't something I could settle by doing a grand transformation sequence and defeating the evil, huh!? Yep, not happening! Think more realistically!)</th>

<th>(But…… Ahhh, I really don’t wanna~! Eggplants and *that* are the only things my instincts can’t deal with! I can never love them…! I’m a failure of a hero!!)</th>

<th>(Someone who would accept anything and everything — Who would love everything, and bring peace to the world! That’s the kind of hero I wanted to be!)</th>

<th>(But *that thing* is the only thing I can’t deal with!! I just caaaaan’t!!!!!)</th>

<th>(But! I’m always pushing my own interests onto everyone in Ryuseitai! Even if they don’t want it, I push it on them semi-forcefully!)</th>

<th>(So rejecting what I can’t handle with “I don’t wanna!” is just ridiculous!)</th>

<th>(It’s not fair to them! That’s not what justice is!)</th>

<th>(My mind knows that! But my body won’t listen! I get goosebumps just thinking about it! Ahhh, you idiot, me! You coward!)</th>

<th>(Don’t lose now, me! Go for it, me! You can do it, you can do it! Stand back up, Morisawa Chiaki…!!!)</th>

{% bubble Hajime %}
…Hffmph!?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki %}
Wha—!? I-I-I-I’m so sorry!![^1] Are you alright!? I’m terribly sorry for bumping into you!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Hajime %}
O-ow… I’m alright~! I’m so sorry, I was also walking with my head in the clouds!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki %}
No, no, it's my bad![^2] The papers you were holding flew everywhere because of me — Hold on, I’ll pick them all up for you!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Hajime %}
Ah! It’s fine, I’ll pick them up myself!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki %}
I can’t let that happen! Let me pick them up, please! I won’t be able to relax otherwise!

If I remember clearly, you’re Shino-kun from Ra*bits… You’re Akehoshi’s favorite kid, right?

If he finds out that I caused trouble for you, he might not speak to me for three months! Something like that has happened before!

In other words, I’m just doing this because I don’t want Akehoshi to hate me! It’s all for my own selfish reasons!

I may be bothering you right now, but please, let me pick them up for you…!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Hajime %}
…Hehe~♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki %}
Huh? Why did you laugh? Did I say something weird again!?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Hajime %}
No, I’m sorry… But you really are exactly how Akehoshi-senpai described you, Morisawa-senpai.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki %}
Oh? Akehoshi gossiped about me? I see now! So the reason I’d sneeze here and there every time the season changes is because of Akehoshi!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Hajime %}
Um, I think that’s just a cold… Please take good care of your health, you won’t be able to sing if you get a sore throat.

Ehehe, if I’m remembering right, ginger tea is good for a cold.

…Wait, huh? What was I talking about?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki %}
Mhm, you have a pretty unique way of pacing the conversation! It’s super cute, there there! ♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Hajime %}
Wah— Awawa…

Ah! Being patted on the head made me remember what I wanted to say! Akehoshi-senpai talks about you a lot, Morisawa-senpai.

He always says you’re irritating and annoying and… Ahhh, I’m sorry, he says things that are hard to say out loud…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki %}
Oh… Yeah, I guess he would. That’s heart-crushing.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Hajime %}
But whenever he talks about you, he has a really gentle look on his face…

And he always sounds happy when he ends it with “Chi~chan-senpai is a hero, after all!”

Heroes are cool, aren’t they? My little brother often watches those shows on Sunday.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki %}
Ohh!! Really! I think I could get along well with your little brother! ♪

…Alright, I finished picking them up while we were talking. Were you taking these somewhere?

I’ll take them there for you as an apology for bumping into you!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Hajime %}
Ah, thank you so much. People have been complimenting my upper strength often lately, so I got ahead of myself and tried to carry many of these papers at once…

But it was a little too much — or, well, it was just very tough.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki %}
Is that so! Aaalright then, leave it to me! I’m pretty good at manual labor!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Hajime %}
Okay, this will really help me. Thank you so much, Morisawa-senpai~♪

By the way, we’re heading to Anzu-san’s classroom.

It looks like she became in charge of planning and managing the Halloween Party, and it looked like it was very hard on her… She said she needed reference materials, you see…

So I tried to find all kinds of things in the reference room. Ehehe, it was pretty rough, though.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki %}
I see… Halloween Party is an S1, after all… Preparing for it must be a huge task.

I wonder if she’ll be okay… She probably has SS to produce for, too…

We have to properly support her — the important one-and-only producer in this school.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Hajime %}
Yes, that’s what I think we should do, too~ People should help each other when in need, after all.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki %}
Yep, that’s correct! You have what it takes to be a hero, Shino-kun! Good, good! ♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Hajime %}
Wah-wah— Um, please don’t pat my head so roughly~!

## Translation Notes

[^1]: Chiaki talks in an informal/masculine manner with a lot of drama added to it. But in various parts of this story, he breaks his usual speech pattern, mostly from being spooked. It’s a little tricky to show that change in speech pattern in English, so I’ve decided to footnote the major ones. You can read more about each of them in the respective chapter’s T/L notes, starting with this one. Here, he apologizes with *gomen* (polite sorry).
[^2]: He switches back to *suman* (informal sorry, the usual he uses)
