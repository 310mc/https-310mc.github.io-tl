This is set in the second year of ES’s establishment. The idols reminisce back on their time in Yumenosaki, in ! Era days (before the Music !! Era storyline started).

{% bubble Tetora curious %}
Memories of those days… What’s somethin’ that’s left a strong impression on you guys? Like a live show you enjoyed, or… Well, anythin’ works, really.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki fist %}
For me, it has to be every single thing related to when I first met you all, no doubt! You’re the greatest comrades ever, I almost want to brag about all of you as loud as I can to the whole world…☆
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata grin %}
i feel the same as chiaki. everyone here is my [treasure]\~[^1] squeeze, squeeze\~☆
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shinobu grin %}
Squeeze, squeeze, nin-nin! It is precisely because Morisawa-dono scouted us with such zeal that we can stand here as the five members of Ryuseitai to this very day~♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki grin %}
Wonderfully said, Kanata, Sengoku…! I might get so overwhelmed with emotion that my vision will go blurry with tears…!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori sighdrop %}
Aren’t you supposed to be more specific when looking back on everything, instead of just hugging each other…? Don’t you agree, Tetora-kun?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora smilesoft %}
Ahaha, you say that even though you’re also hugging back. You really aren’t honest~ But still, I’m glad you’re getting the topic movin’.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shinobu srsthinking %}
However, it’s difficult to be specific when so much had happened back then…? I can’t quite pin down one specific event to mention, either… Mm~
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata norsmile2 %}
our time together during ‘supernova’ left a strong [impression] on me. we stood on a big [stage] in an [amusement park], right?[^2]
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki smileconfident %}
There was a lot of scurrying about during the planning and performance, but that only made it all the more moving once the five heroes were assembled together on stage! Don’t you think so too, Takamine!?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori serious %}
I feel like I’m on the verge of a stomach ache just remembering how nerve-wracking it was back then… But, well, yeah. I think you could say it was definitely a big step forward.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora northinking %}
Our huge event toward the beginning of the year was Supernova, so that means our huge event by the end of the year has gotta be Repayment Festival, right?[^3]
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shinobu awkward %}
Rather than an event, it felt more like a trial of some sort. During those days, we had bumped into all sorts of walls with our seniors’ graduation being just around the corner.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori sighfrown %}
You guys keep mentioning stuff that just gives me a stomach ache… I mean, the reason we bumped into those walls that time… Or more like, the person who <em>made</em> those walls was mainly me, so…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata smile %}
but, you managed to confront it properly, and it was very admirable of you. chiaki and i even got to be on stage and [perform] alongside you three in a [calculating] way~♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki grin %}
Ahh, it made me so happy to stand on Repayment Festival’s stage as the five of us! The moment I said my catchphrase, I was instantly flooded with emotions…☆
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata smilesoft2 %}
everyone [grew up] so incredibly well, after all. ufufu, look how much bigger you have all gotten~…♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori curious %}
Huh, why’re you talking like a relative who hasn’t seen family in a while…? Even after you seniors graduated — a lot of things may have happened, but we were still Ryuseitai every day.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shinobu nod %}
Ryuseitai every day… That’s such a nice string of words~♪ Tomorrow too, the day after that, and even beyond… We shall be Ryuseitai every day!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora fist %}
Ossu! No matter what happens, we’ll join forces as the five of us, and move forward step by step…♪

## Translation Notes

[^1]: Midori also called Ryuseitai his treasure before, in <a href="/comet_show/epilogue" target="_blank">Comet Show, Epilogue 4</a> (right at the end).
[^2]: Referring to <a href="https://ensemble-stars.fandom.com/wiki/Supernova" target="_blank">Supernova</a>, an important Ryuseitai story that marked a big milestone in their hero-idol path (It was their very first huge-scale performance).
[^3]: Referring to <a href="/climax" target="_blank">Climax</a>, Ryuseitai's Repayment Festival (graduation) story. This is also a very important story that showed the juniors’ growth after a year of being in the unit.
