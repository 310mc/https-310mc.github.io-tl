<th>(Yesterday I had work. Today I have work. Tomorrow I'll have work. Every day from morning to evening is work, work, and more work… Ahh… I'm so depressed…)</th>

I know I'm the one who did all those things, but still… Why did it turn out this way…?

            Good morning, Anzu-san. I'm so sorry for giving off "I wanna die" energy from the early morning…

            I'll manage to get myself back on track once it's time for work, really… I wouldn't want to cause trouble for you 'cause of my own personal problems, so…

            I asked to be crammed with work, after all… Even I think I'm crazy for doing that.

            But lately I'm really worn out 'cause it's all I've been doing… I don't really wanna feel this way early in the morning, either…

"You don't have to force yourself to do all these jobs"…? Anzu-san… I'm sure you know what's been happening, right?

Right now, it's been, how do I say it… In short, I just don't wanna see anyone from Ryuseitai at the moment.

I know I'm being selfish. But I just mentally can't do it…

            You're willing to hear me out and nod your head to everything I say? You really are reliable, Anzu-san.

            And meanwhile, I'm just a coward… Ah wait, I shouldn't be so negative… Ahh… I really can't stand myself.

            That's what hurts so much. Everyone knows how it's been for us lately, and yet… we're still so tense with each other.

            It feels like we're all forced to be together, walk on eggshells around each other, and avoid dampening the mood as much as possible… It hurts so much…

            Maybe it's how powerless I feel, and how it feels like all I'm doing is just throwing tantrums… Or maybe how Morisawa-senpai doesn't bother talking to his own unit members about anything… Or maybe how nothing's been working out for us…

            I don't even know anymore… What's hurting me this much…?

I ended up making you listen to my vents again… I'm so sorry.

I say I wanna be left alone, but then when I *am* left alone, I just end up drowning in my depression… I'm such a pain in the ass, aren't I…

Either way, thank you so much for hearing me out, Anzu-san.

            "No matter the reason, I'm glad to see you working really hard"…? I guess so…

            But I feel like a part of me was saved hearing that. Alright… I'm starting to feel a lot better now, so I'll do my best at work.

            Mmm~… I feel like I've said this before but, I don't feel right to give more work to someone who's already so busy…

            That's why this time around, I'm just grateful to know you feel that way. I don't really like it when all I do is just depend on others, anyway.

            You really, *really* helped me out. I barely have anyone I could vent about all of this to…

            I'd like to repay the favor through work. I don't slack off at work in the first place, but still, I'm going to work extra harder today, I promise.
