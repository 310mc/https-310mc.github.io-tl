I have watched historical dramas with an evil magistrate, but how would an evil *ninja* be like…?

Hmm… Not to mention, ninjas' very livelihood is in working within the shadows. I feel as though that is evil-like in of itself…

Mm—!? I sense a presence behind me… Ah, it was you, Anzu-dono!?

{% bubble Shinobu v2 %}
Mm? What was I pondering about? Ah, you heard me earlier?

You see, I may have to play the role of a villain in one of my jobs.

So I have been trying to decode what an evil ninja would be like.

<div class="minitalk" character="Anzu">
    <div class="minitalk-option">
        <div class="minitalk-option_header">
            That sounds difficult.

        <div class="minitalk-option_content">
            {% bubble Shinobu v2 %}
            Indeed… In the first place, to be a ninja is to serve your lord.

            My image of an evil ninja would depend on the sort of evil person my lord would be…

            {% bubble Shinobu v2 %}
            Ah! Actually, it hasn't been decided yet if I will be a ninja.

            I simply just *hope* I can be, that is all… Ehehe, perhaps I am getting a little too ahead of myself?

            {% bubble Shinobu v2 %}
            I-I am certain I can! As Ryusei Yellow, I cannot overlook the evil rampant in the world, but…

            That is a different matter, and this is its own matter! A ninja never involves their personal affairs in their tasks!

That reminds me, did you have something to speak to me about, Anzu-dono?

You have been worried about everyone in Ryuseitai…? So you wanted to check up on me?

I very much appreciate you doing so, but I feel bad that we made you worry this much…

            Of course I won't! Regardless, I have always believed in my comrades.

            *All for one, one for all!* That is what makes us Ryuseitai!

            I'm alright. Midori-kun seems to be aching a little, and it worries me, but…

            I'm sure everyone will be alright, as well. Our hearts are always one and the same, after all.

            I'm extremely grateful to hear that. I believe in everyone, but…

            It feels much more reassuring when you have someone by your side during harsh times, doesn't it?
