…Hmm. So this is the planning of that show Midori-kun announced in Comet Show the other day?

"A blockbuster that will go down in tokusatsu history"… Sounds pretty big.

I spotted some famous heroes even I know of in the list. Even heroes from overseas'll appear, huh?

…Ohh, there's a whole buncha other plans too, huh?

Oh yeah, I heard Ra*bits is gonna try participating in a variety show.

I think Tomoya-kun said it was called "Bogie Time", or somethin'.

            Punishment games are a staple in variety shows, huh?

Do you have a meeting after this, Anego?

Ryuseitai-N will disband soon, but I'd like to give my juniors one last practice session.
