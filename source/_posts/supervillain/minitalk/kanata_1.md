            that is a [shame]~… but it cannot be helped.

oh yes, have i told you anything about my time in [okinawa] during the [ss qualifying round]?

okinawa's [ocean] is so pretty, and the fishies were so [lively]~♪

it is a little too difficult for us right now but, i hope to go there again with ryuseitai and [puka puka] together~

            we would have even more [fun] if you were with us, anzu-san.

            we will relax and enjoy [puka puka] time with everyone… i am sure it would bring us so much joy if we could make this happen~♪

            anzu-san, you are such a [worrywart]~. i only [puka puka] at the [sandbank], so you will not have to worry.

            even then, i would be with heroes who are always willing to come to their [comrade's] rescue~♪

            fufu, yes. i would also love to have a [private] trip with everyone.

anzu-san, if you were to [travel], where would you like to go?

i am fine with anywhere as long as there is a place to [puka puka]~♪

ah, but it would probably be painful to do that in a [cold] place with [drift ice].

            fufu, i am just [joking]. i know i could die if i were to [puka puka] in [extremely cold] places.

            i will settle with having a [splish splash] time, instead~♪

            yes, it would feel so good to [puka puka] in warm weather, too~♪

            [hokkaido]…♪ it is a wonderful [place], isn't it? it is [blessed] with sea~

            and [hokkaido] is abundant with [planktons], so the [fishies] have plenty of food to eat~♪
