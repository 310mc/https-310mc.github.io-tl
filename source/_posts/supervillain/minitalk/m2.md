I know I'm part of why this happened, but… Why did it turn out this way…?

            Good morning, Anzu-san. I'm so sorry for giving off "I wanna die" energy from the early morning…

            I'll manage to get myself back on track once it's time for work, really… I wouldn't want to cause trouble for you 'cause of my own personal problems, so…

            I asked for a whole lot of jobs, after all… Even I think I'm crazy for doing that.

            But lately it's all I've ever doing, so I'm really worn out… I don't really wanna feel this way early in the morning, either…

"You don't have to force yourself to do that job, too"…? Anzu-san… I'm sure you know what's been happening, right?

Right now, it's been, how do I say it… In short, I just don't wanna see anyone from Ryuseitai at the moment.

I know I'm being selfish. But I just emotionally can't do it…

            You're willing to hear me out? You really are reliable, Anzu-san.

            That's what hurts so much. Everyone knows how it's been for us lately, and yet… we're still so tense with each other.

            It feels like we're all forced to be together, walk on eggshells around each other, and try way too hard not to dampen the mood… It hurts so much…

            How I feel powerless and just throwing tantrums, maybe… Or maybe how Morisawa-senpai doesn't bother talking to us about anything… Or maybe how nothing's been working out for us…

            I don't even know anymore… What's hurting me this much…?

I ended up making you listen to my vents again… I'm so sorry.

I say I wanna be left alone, but then if I *am* left alone, I just end up drowned in my depression… I'm such a pain in the ass, aren't I…

Either way, thank you so much for hearing me out, Anzu-san.

            But I feel like a part of me was saved hearing that.   Alright… I feel a lot better now, so I'll do my best at work.

            Mmm~… I feel like I've said this before but, I don't feel right to give more work to someone who's already so busy…

            That's why this time around, I'm just grateful for the sentiment. I don't really like it when all I do is just depend on others, anyway.

            You really, *really* helped me out. I barely have anyone I could talk to about all of this…

            I'd like to repay the favor through work. I'm not one to slack off at work, but still, I'm going to work extra harder today, I promise.
