Oh? Hello, Anzu! Are you on your way home after finishing work, too?

I also just finished up with my meeting about the show.

Mhm, this is perfect timing for both of us! How about we eat dinner together?

            Hmm… Well, I had to film a scene for a drama, so I'm starving!

            If you're alright with it, I'd love to eat something filling! French fries sounds really good right about now!

            Yep! I had to film a scene for a drama, too, so I didn't get to have a proper lunch.

            But don't worry, I haven't been overworking myself! I'm doing great!

They say hunger is the best sauce in the world, and they were right! Everything tastes super delicious when you're hungry!

I could count this as a reward for finishing up my work, even. You worked hard the whole day too, right?

Then please eat to your hearts content, to restore your energy for tomorrow!

            Mhm, that's the spirit! I'll also eat just as much to recharge myself for tomorrow.

            As a hero, I have to ensure I can always rush over to anyone's call for help!

            Of course! The reason we always have a tomorrow is to make it a better day than today!

Whew, I'm stuffed! I'm sure this'll make me have all the energy I need to get by tomorrow!

Heheh, Anzu, you also seem happy after a full meal! It's really such a fortunate feeling to eat to our heart's content, isn't it?

……I wonder if everyone in Ryuseitai is also eating properly…

          You really are worried about them after all.

            Yeah… The five of us haven't been able to get together for a while now, so…

            While there are a few of us who show up, there are some who I haven't seen in a while. I can't help but worry about them in the end…

            {% bubble Chiaki frown %}
            I want to believe in that, too… However, the person who put Ryuseitai in this position is—… No, I shouldn't look like this in front of Anzu.

            …Alright! I'm going to go for a run to refresh myself!

            {% bubble Chiaki srsthinking %}
            A souvenir…? But there are a few who haven't been showing up, so I don't know when I'd be able to give it to them…

            No…! I shouldn't give up before even trying. Thank you, Anzu! I'll try to look for something on my way back home!
