Aaalright! I've bought everything I need.

Mm? Oh, Anzu-dono! It is a pleasure to see you here.

Were you also shopping? If it's too heavy on you, I will assist you!

            I also have my own shopping bags to carry? No, no, there is no need to worry over me.

            As a ninja who has been building up a lot of experience through training, this is nothing for me!

            All the more reason that I should assist you! Worry not, this is simply just another part of my traini—

            Gwuh!? I-It's much heavier than I thought…!? I almost dropped it out of surprise…

{% bubble Shinobu v2 %}
Ah, you're wondering what I bought?

I have a mission that requires me to travel far away. Thus, I went shopping in preparation for that.

I must always prepare beforehand before conducting in any intelligence gathering!

            That sounds tough.

            {% bubble Shinobu v2 %}
            This is simply just a natural part of life as a ninja! Ah, actually, this doesn't just concern the way of the ninja.

            I always ensure to do the exact same thing with my Student Council and idol work, as well!

            Indeed, you also busy yourself with a lot of preparation for a job, yes?

            I cannot express just how grateful I am for all the hard work you put in for our sakes!

            I am grateful that you feel that way, but I will be alright. It's nothing I require troubling you over.

            I know you are a very busy person, Anzu-dono. I mustn't depend on you for every little thing!

Speaking of travelling far… Do you ever go somewhere far away on your holidays, Anzu-dono?

I make sure to continue my ninja training even on my days off, so I don't usually go outside.

However, I do tend to feel like going to places that are used for historical dramas.

            I see… You usually spend your time at home on your days off, as well?

            You are always such a busy person, after all! I would love to see you rest a little on your holidays.

            You aren't!? That's incredible, Anzu-dono! For you to be able to set foot in so many places all over…!

            I, too, should not settle with only the thought of going, and make sure to turn it into a plan of action.

            Are you sure…!? Then I would *love* to invite Kanzaki-dono over so that we may go to together!

            Please do let me know when we can go together! I'm excited already~♪
