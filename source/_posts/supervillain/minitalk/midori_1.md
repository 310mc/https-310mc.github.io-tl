Huh? Anzu-san, what're you doing here?

There's a film you'd like to use as reference, so you're here to rent a DVD…?

Oh wow, what a coincidence. I'm on my way to the rental shop 'cause I have something I'd like to rent, too.

            {% bubble Midori %}
            I just found out there's an anime with a kinda mascot-like, soft-looking protagonist.

            I wanted to watch it to feel healed. Have you been watching it, Anzu-san? I haven't yet, so I still don't know if it's interesting or not.

            Is it a tokusatsu DVD?

            {% bubble Midori %}
            Of course not. I already get forced by Morisawa-senpai to watch a bunch of them…

            I don't have to go out of my way to rent them, just asking that guy would be enough… He'd probably even lend me bonus DVDs and whatnot… Not that I ever plan to borrow any tokusatsu DVD from him…

            {% bubble Midori %}
            Hmmm… I don't really watch that much stuff, honestly.

            Ah-- This one tokusatsu movie Morisawa-senpai showed me before was pretty interesting. But I watched it a long time ago, so I don't even remember the name anymore…

{% bubble Midori %}
Do I often watch movies…? Erm, I wouldn't say I would…

I wouldn't be able to tell you who my favorite director is, and I usually just watch movies whenever I'm in the mood.

What about you, Anzu-san? Do you usually watch movies?

            {% bubble Midori %}
            That means you're thinking about work even when it's movie time…?

            That's a lot different from how I live life… Now I see how you're always so busy, Anzu-san…

            I see… Well, if you're mostly watching them for work, it makes sense you wouldn't as much in your own free time…

            It'd suck to have your work distract you on your days off, after all…

            Going to the cinema and eating popcorn is the best feeling…? Huh, you really are enjoying yourself.

            Okay, then since this is good timing for both of us, please feel free to recommend me any movie if you have something.

You were able to rent the DVD you wanted? I'm glad…♪

We spent the whole time just talking about interesting series and recommendations, that I didn't even realize the time…

But I feel like we got a lot out of it. We'll get to have a lot of fun watching stuff on our holidays, huh?

            I dunno if the anime I recommended is your type, but I personally love it~♪

            I hope its fluffy soft world helps you relax on your day off.

            Huh!? It's a horror movie…!? But the cover looks so soft and fluffy…!

            I don't like horror, but… I'm kinda curious to see how they turn something so soft-looking into a horror.

            Okay. I'd like to hear what you think too, Anzu-san. Ah, but if you didn't find it fun, please don't tell me about it.

            I think I'll feel like dying inside if I had to hear it from you face-to-face…
