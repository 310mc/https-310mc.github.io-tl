Huh? Anzu-san, what're you doing here?

There's a certain media you'd like to use as reference, so you're here to rent a DVD…?

Oh wow, what a coincidence. I'm on my way to the rental shop 'cause I have something I'd like to rent, too.

            {% bubble Midori smile3 %}
            I just found out there's an anime with a kinda mascot-like, soft-looking protagonist.

            I wanted to watch it to heal myself a little. Are you watching it too, Anzu-san? I haven't yet, so I still don't know if it's interesting or not.

            Is it a tokusatsu DVD?

            {% bubble Midori sigh2 %}
            Of course not. I already get forced by Morisawa-senpai to watch a bunch of them…

            I don't have to go out of my way to rent them, just asking that guy would be enough… He'd probably even lend me bonus DVDs and whatnot… Not that I ever plan to borrow any tokusatsu DVD from him…

            Hmm… I don't really watch that much stuff, honestly.

            Ah— This one tokusatsu movie Morisawa-senpai showed me before was pretty interesting. I watched it a long time ago though, so I don't even remember the name anymore…

{% bubble Midori curious %}
Are you asking me if I watch movies often…? Um, I wouldn't say I do…

I wouldn't be able to tell you who my favorite director is, and I usually just watch movies that peek my interest whenever I'm in the mood for one.

What about you, Anzu-san? Do you usually watch movies?
{% endbubble %}

            There's a lot I've watched for reference.

            {% bubble Midori worried %}
            That just means you're thinking about work even when you're watching movies during your free time, doesn't it…?

            That's a lot different from how I live life… Now I see how you're always so busy, Anzu-san…

            {% bubble Midori sigh2 %}
            I see… Well, if you're mostly watching them for work, it makes sense you wouldn't as much in your own free time…

            It'd suck to have your work distract you on your days off, after all…

            {% bubble Midori curious %}
            Watching a movie while eating popcorn in a cinema is the best feeling…? Huh, you really are enjoying yourself.

            Okay, then since this is good timing for both of us, please feel free to recommend me any movie if you have anything in mind.

You were able to rent the DVD you wanted? I'm glad…♪

We spent the whole time just talking about interesting series and our recommendations, that I didn't even realize the day went by…

But I feel like we got a lot out of it. We'll get to have a lot of fun watching stuff on our days off, huh?

            I dunno if the anime I recommended is your type, but I personally love it~♪

            I hope its fluffy and soft world helps you relax on your day off.

            Huh!? It's a horror movie…!? But the cover looks so soft and fluffy…!

            I don't like scary stuff, but… Now I'm kinda curious to see how they turn something so soft-looking into a horror.

            Okay. I'd like to hear what you think too, Anzu-san. Ah, but if you didn't like it, please don't tell me about it.

            I think I'll feel like dying inside if I had to hear it from you face-to-face…
