Anzu! Could you hear me out for a bit!?

Remember the tokusatsu show I got an offer for? They finally decided on its name!

I wanted to let you know about it, since you've advised me a lot throughout the process!
{% endbubble %}

<div class="minitalk" character="Anzu">
    <div class="minitalk-option">

            Finally!

            {% bubble Chiaki v2 %}
            Mhm! The details of the show aside, I definitely didn't want to end up reporting to you uncool stuff like, "I couldn't transform", or something!

            So I'm also really happy I get to inform you about good news…☆

        </div>
        <div class="minitalk-option_content">
            {% bubble Chiaki v2 %}
            Oh! I almost forgot to *actually* say it. The title is — "Supervillains"!

            The documents they showed me finally removed the "tentative" disclaimer from the title. The moment I saw that, I felt emotional, like "ah, at last!"

            {% bubble Chiaki v2 %}
            I'm so sorry for worrying you all this time. That's all the more why I wanted to share this joy with you…!

            There are still a lot of obstacles ahead, but just this step alone makes me so happy! I couldn't help but report to you about it!

{% bubble Chiaki awkward %}
Now that we've celebrated the good news… The truth is, the actual details of the show haven't been confirmed yet.

Oh yeah, Anzu — Do you like stories where the hero turns evil?

I've heard it's been a hot topic lately, but other than that…
{% endbubble %}

<div class="minitalk" character="Anzu">
    <div class="minitalk-option">
        <div class="minitalk-option_header">
            I think I like it.
        </div>
        <div class="minitalk-option_content">
            {% bubble Chiaki frown %}
            I see… I guess there really *is* an increasing demand for that type of story lately.

            A hero that walks down the path of evil, huh… Mmm, I can't help but find it frustrating somehow.

    <div class="minitalk-option">
        <div class="minitalk-option_header">
            I can see why people would like it.
        </div>
        <div class="minitalk-option_content">
            {% bubble Chiaki v2 %}
            Yeah, there's been a lot of stories lately about how evil can be good if you look at it from a different angle.

            Well, that's a different topic from heroes turning evil, though! As for me, I of course love cool, virtuous heroes!
			{% endbubble %}

    <div class="minitalk-option">
        <div class="minitalk-option_header">
            I think it depends on the story.
        </div>
        <div class="minitalk-option_content">
            {% bubble Chiaki v2 %}
            Oh, that makes sense. You can't really judge how you feel about unless you know the context, right?

            What's important here is *how* the hero turns evil, right? Thank you, Anzu! I can use this as reference!

{% bubble Chiaki v2 %}
Why did I suddenly mention heroes turning evil? Well… I mentioned that they still haven't decided on the show's details, right?

There's a possibility that we, Ryuseitai, will end up having roles with that sort of concept.

I wanted to hear your thoughts on it as well, so that it may help me with preparing for my role!

<div class="minitalk" character="Anzu">

          Something to help you with that…

            {% bubble Chiaki v2 %}
            Ohh? You'll look for references that could help me!? That would be most helpful!

            Now that you're going to help me out, I *have* to battle through this job so as not to put a stain on all your efforts!
			{% endbubble %}

    <div class="minitalk-option">
        <div class="minitalk-option_header">
            It sounds like a hard role to prepare for.

            {% bubble Chiaki v2 %}
            That's true… The heroes I love most are those that are cool and virtuous, after all.

            But this is just one of the many important tasks I must undertake as an idol! I won't slack off just because it isn't anything similar to my ideals! I'll make sure to put all my effort in it!

            {% bubble Chiaki v2 %}
            Thank you! The same goes for you, Anzu. If there's anything you're struggling with, please let me know.

            I may end up turning evil for my given role, but for your sake, I'm always willing to rush to your side as a hero…☆
