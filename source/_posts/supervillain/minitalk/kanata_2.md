            fufu, i am glad to hear that~♪ but the truth is, sea [crooks] are scared of you too, anzu-san.

            for example, [moray eels] and [bering wolffish] are actually very [timid] fishies~♪

{% bubble Kanata sigh %}
you're wondering if everyone in ryuseitai is okay…?

hmm… i wonder. i have not been able to [see] tetora and midori lately.

i am not particularly [worried] about us being separated, but it is lonely not [seeing] them~

            yes. so please do [watch over] us, anzu-san.

            no matter the [predicament], the heroes will come together and [show themselves] in the end~♪

            if we ended up making you feel [lonely], anzu-san, then we will need to [reflect] on ourselves a little…

            after all, we are heroes. we must not make the people watching us feel [sad].

            i would be glad if you could watch over us. to watch our very moment when we, the heroes, arrive to the scene with [smiles] on our faces.

            i am sure that is what would give everyone in ryuseitai [strength]~♪
