Colors Arise!
Now, I’ll raise up a blinding beam of light
That’s right, I’ll proudly
make my own light shine!

If there is a destination you desire to reach
Then we’ll push your back, encouraging you to take that step forward
Go forth!
Go forth!
Pierce through gravity itself
(Let’s fire the heart!)

The right answers
The mistakes
Will be different in each route
That wish of yours is an unstoppable
Meteor that soars through the sky freely
(Your light!)

What we’ll protect
(Your resolve)
All of it
(Your courage)
Your soul! Your heart!
Resides within the vast universe

Colors Arise!
Now, we realize — there isn’t only one, is there?
That’s right, within the jet black that embraces the infinite colors
Look, we can see in our eyes — the hue that adorns you
That’s right, time has already been engraved
That hesitation and vow of ours
Will surely signalize our own light!

If everyone has different feelings and desires
Then even our pain won’t be the same
Reach forth!
Reach forth!
Stretch out our hands
To those who wait for rescue
(Reach for your hand!)

There may be a boundary where trying to surpass it seems futile
But the strength to overcome it
Are meteors that can shoot out their own radiance together
(Your light!)

You are not alone
(I’ll hold your hand)
Believe in that
(Those different feelings)
Various colors!
They sound together, reverberating that they are all justice

Look here, If it’s a signal you need, I’ll send you one
You’re bound to understand it, aren’t you?
That’s right, that’s the white light that embraces the infinite colors
We reflect one another within our eyes, those respectable hues
That’s right, we don’t need a reason
Because we’ve now stacked our resolve onto each other

(We’re fighting for justice.)
(Let’s go ahead! Let’s go ahead!)

Everyone is
Bound to have
Something precious they refuse to yield
Instead of hesitating,
I want to protect mine
That is why justice has color

Colors Arise!
Now, I’ll raise it up, this belongs to nobody but me
That’s right, this is my color, and I’ll proudly make it shine
You can see it within your eyes, can’t you? All the hues reaching you
That’s right, time has already been engraved
This vow will surely signalize our future as well
The steps we’ve taken are like meteors
(We are shooting stars.)
Now, let’s move forward
With the ensemble formed through our resolve

Signalize our own light!
Because we have to be heroes!
