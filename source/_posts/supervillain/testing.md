<div class="msr-narration">
    <p>The next day. Okinawa prefecture, in one of the downtown alleyways, far away from the headquarters building of the agency, “Crimson Production”…</p>
</div>

{% bubble Tetora vside %}
—An intruder?[^3]

Is it another one of those random local punks causing a ruckus around the area again? Like those Oni descendants[^4] or something—

No? They’ve been relatively quiet since their boss left for the US? I hear there’s still some guys left over around here, though?

There have been rumors that they’re regaining power, while the local powerhouses have been flattened across the board in SS—

Hmmm… Well, even if they’re just a bunch of troublemakers, we should be on the lookout just in case.

Yeah. For the time being, I’ll leave it to the B squad of the battle branch to deal with the intruder.
{% endbubble %}

{% img /img/es/eventstory/supervillain/tetoraorigcg.jpg %}

{% bubble Tetora vside %}
I know. We’ll also settle our matters as fast as possible, and then return to the headquarters building. We’ll discuss countermeasures against the mysterious intruder after that.

——Right then, time for another fun day of work at the evil organization.
{% endbubble %}

{% img /img/es/eventstory/supervillain/darkstarch4_2.jpg %}

<div class="msr-narration">
    <p>Next morning. Near the whereabouts of Crimson Production’s headquarters…</p>
</div>

{% bubble Shinobu v2 %}
Hello, Taichou-dono? This is Sengoku Shinobu speaking, over.

As per our plan, I have reached the area of the company that Tetora-kun was dispatched to, which is called, erm… Right, the Crimson Production headquarters.

T-The air it emits is so grandiose that it is a little scary… A modern-looking building stands alone in the middle of a primeval forest, as if it were nothing more than a picturesque view.

There are no signs of dwelling anywhere nearby; only a majestically vast wilderness that stretches on.

Around the building is some sort of training ground… This may sound like an exaggeration, but it sort of looks like a military facility.

Ah, yes, I am aware of that. I have not forgotten that there are US military bases in Okinawa, so I will be extra careful not to trend anywhere close to them and risk myself.

There is no need to worry. When we were in Okinawa for the SS qualifying rounds, I had already mastered the geography and other various details about the region.

Indeed, I will not take any chances. I shall simply observe the situation, as we will be conducting a thorough investigation tomorrow.
{% endbubble %}

{% img /img/es/eventstory/supervillain/darkstarch4_3.jpg %}

{% bubble Shinobu serious %}
Yes… This would have been easier if we managed to make contact with Tetora-kun through HoldHands or something, but we have not gotten any response for some reason.

Ah, no, actually… I can see a glimpse of someone who looks like Tetora-kun through the window of the building, and he seems to be doing rather well.

For some reason, he is leaning back on his chair with his legs propped up on an expensive-looking desk—

Is that really Tetora-kun…? He seems unusually different somehow…

Mhm. Regardless, I can assure you that Tetora-kun is alive and well. Although, I don’t know why he’s refusing all contact with us.

It does not help that we have no knowledge of Tetora-kun’s current situation, either.

I tried to gather some information about Crimson Production from locals on the way, but it appears that there is not much information known to anybody here, either.

Apparently, it used to be a well-established entertainment agency in Okinawa, but there has been little to no activity in recent years.

Indeed, it is as you say — Despite this, they have built a new building, and the land around here is apparently all owned by Crimson Production.

Mhm, mhm… I truly do wonder where they acquired the money to buy such extravagant property, when they have not even produced anything worthwhile. It’s quite obviously fishy.

There is definitely something going on here, Taichou-dono.
{% endbubble %}

{% img /img/es/eventstory/supervillain/darkstarch4_4.jpg %}

{% bubble Shinobu v2 %}
Oh, yes, of course. I am but a humble ninja idol, not a detective or police officer. I assure you that I will not do anything that could stir up problems for myself.

For the time being, it’s more than enough if we can simply confirm Tetora-kun’s current status.

Hm? No, no, please leave this all to me!

As we know, Midori-kun is taking on more personal work than he should, but you and Shinkai-dono have a lot of work to do as well, correct?

There is no need for you to cancel your schedule and come all the way to Okinawa. Is that not the agreement we had in yesterday’s discussion?

Mhm, mhm. It seems that the upperclassmen at Yumenosaki Academy are in dispute these days, as it is graduation season.

However, I still have one more year to go as a highschooler, so my yearmates and I are practically left out of the loop regarding all of that.

I have got the time to spare for all of this. That’s why you need not worry, I’ll be alright.

Hmm? What about my work as a Student Council member? Ohhh~ Yes, well, we’re stuck in one place right now, so even then, I have a lot of availab—
{% endbubble %}

{% img /img/es/eventstory/supervillain/darkstarch4_5.jpg %}

{% bubble Shinobu worried %}
Hmm?

Huh? Oh no, erm, it’s just that I thought I saw something move in the bushes…?

A-A wild animal, perhaps? Or is it a security guard…?

E-Either way, I have a bad feeling about this, so I must conceal myself at once! Yes, I’ll provide you a full report later — For now, I will excuse myself!

## Chapter 5

<div class="msr-location">
    <p><span><b>Location:</b> Near the ES building, inside ESTele’s studio</span></p>
</div>

{% img /img/es/eventstory/supervillain/darkstarch5_1.jpg %}

<div class="msr-narration">
    <p>At the same time…</p>
</div>

{% bubble Chiaki surprised %}
S-Sengoku!? Sengoku, can you hear meee!?

I lost signal… I-Is everything going to be alright…?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata worried %}
mm~ i feel as though we should have gone to [okinawa] too, after all.

the [atmosphere] felt far too alarming…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki frown %}
No, we’ve all made our decision yesterday. We said that we’d leave it all to him based on the fact that he’s been extremely reliable these days.

And that we’ll do our best with our regular duties in Ryuseitai, while Sengoku is investigating what’s happening over on the other side.

I’m concerned about Nagumo, but we can’t afford to take a loss in our work. That would only worry the fans and the involved staff even more.

Unlike the heroes on TV, we can’t live our lives fighting all the time… That’s always the harsh reality about life, huh…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata idle %}
yes… but still, we will do what we can.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki v2 %}
Yup. Of course, we’ll ensure full backup for Sengoku while doing our job. I would like to think that even though we’re physically far apart, our hearts are always one and the same.
{% endbubble %}

{% img /img/es/eventstory/supervillain/darkstarch5_2.jpg %}

{% bubble Chiaki serious %}
Takamine is still prioritizing his personal work as we speak, though…

But, well… I suppose he can’t boycott the work he had already agreed to do, so there isn’t much we can do about it.

Takamine used to have no motivation, but now he works hard on his jobs no matter the reason. Personally, I refuse to oppose that.

The one who kept telling him to do his best, and to keep going is me, after all.

I refuse to become a two-faced person who changes what they say depending on the time and place.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata smile %}
fufu~ that would not be cool to do after all, right?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki idle %}
Yeah… Anyway, we have a scene to shoot, but I’d like to support Sengoku by gathering information in between.

In the meantime, I’m trying to contact the ever-knowledgeable Tenshouin on HoldHands to see if he knows anything. I’ll try other people, as well.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata v2 %}
me too, i will ask [rei] if he knows something, since he is always so well-informed on everything.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki idle %}
Yeah, please do. There are also various rumors and speculations circulating on the Internet, but they seem to have no basis, so I think we should take them with a grain of salt.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata awkward %}
yes~… the [internet] is so scary. i have come to understand that during the [summer].
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki smile2 %}
Yeah, but I don’t think we should stay away from it excessively like how Takamine is. It’s how you utilize the enormous power you’ve been bestowed that determines whether you’re a hero of justice or a villain.

I learned that from Kamen Riders.

Tokusatsu shows taught me everything important in life.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata sad %}
…is tetora really going to [leave] ryuseitai entirely…?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki idle %}
That’s what the rumors say, but I don’t think so.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata curious %}
what makes you [say] that?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki serious %}
The ES rules. If you wish to withdraw from your unit, you <em>must</em> have the approval of the leader first. Those are the rules.

And I, the current leader of Ryuseitai, have not received any request form of withdrawal from Nagumo, nor have I approved it.

Since staff readjustments will create an issue with salaries and other aspects, it requires a report to ES — in other words, to the agency — as well as following official procedures, and so on and so forth.

And when I talked to Tenshouin, the verified head-manager of the current StarPro office, he also said that Nagumo hasn’t submitted any documents related to the matter.

I’ll ask Tenshoin to investigate as much as he can within his authority, and if he comes up with nothing, then it proves that there really *is* nothing to those rumors.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata frown %}
uu~… all these things about [rules] and [procedures]… it is a difficult [topic], isn’t it?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki frown %}
Human society is a complex and tiresome place, Kanata. No matter where you go, you’ll find documents, documents, and more documents.

That being said, I think it’s much more peaceful and upscale than a society where everything is decided only by feelings and impulse.

There isn’t any way to confirm what a person is thinking, but with documents, you can.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata curious %}
even though chiaki is exactly the [type] to act only through [impulse]…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki awkward %}
I’m not young anymore… Achieving anything through impulse alone only works until elementary school.

My point is, the online news about Nagumo leaving Ryuseitai and creating a new group called “RB” is likely a downright lie without any basis whatsoever.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata frown2 %}
that is what is called [fake news], yes? we have been constantly suffering from such reports since [summer].
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki v2 %}
No, let’s instead look on the bright side here and think, “After facing such hardships during the summer, we can now use those experiences to benefit ourselves.” None of the things we went through, and none of our effort, will be in vain. They never are, nor will they ever be.

Anyway, the question here is, how did this news come about?

How will the public react to it? And how should we deal with it?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata smile %}
in a similar way to “we have [trouble], a [monster] has appeared,” yes?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki serious %}
Yeah. Everything in life would’ve been so much easier if we could’ve simply assumed that “it’s all Gorgom’s doing!”[^5], but—

Just as there are no heroes in this reality, there are no purely evil monsters or villainous organizations, either.
{% endbubble %}

## Chapter 6

{% img /img/es/eventstory/supervillain/darkstarch6_1.jpg %}

<div class="msr-narration">
    <p>Nearly an hour later. Okinawa, in the Crimson Production agency office…</p>
</div>

{% bubble Tetora vside %}
—Now then.

You really put us in a tight spot, “Sengoku-kun”.

Trespassing on our private property, investigating the area… I can’t simply let that slide, you know? That’s why I had a subordinate restrain you.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shinobu angry2 %}
………
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora vside %}
I suppose it’d be silly to ask why you’re here, so let’s get straight to it — Is it because you were worried for me?

You guys are a meddling lot as always.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shinobu surprised %}
— Okay, seriously, who *are* you!?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora vside %}
Hm? What do you mean?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shinobu surprised %}
What is *up* with the way you talk!? It sounds so *weird!*

Where did the Tetora-kun who would always say “Uu~myu” and “Ossu!” and “‘Sup!” go!?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora vside %}
Um, I *am* Nagumo Tetora, though? Quit yapping, it’s embarrassing.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shinobu surprised %}
Our Tetora-kun would *never* say that! What is going on here!? Have you been brainwashed by aliens or some kind of villainous organization!?

Or has a ghost possessed you, by any chance?

Ah—! Is it like NEGI-dono—
{% endbubble %}

{% img /img/es/eventstory/supervillain/darkstarch6_2.jpg %}

{% bubble Tetora vside %}
Look, that’s besides the point right now.

I’ve got matters of my own to sort through, so I can’t stick around and chat with you.

I’ll give you an option, though. If you sign here on this document, indicating that you promise you’ll never spill anything you’ve seen or heard here, I’ll let you go unharmed. So, what’s it going to be?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shinobu worried %}
Uuu~ I cannot promise that! I must report to Taichou-dono and Shinkai-dono about how absolutely strange you’ve been acting!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora frown %}
“Taichou-dono,” huh? Hmph.  …Fine, I’ll just have you confined here for longer, then. Relax, I’ll get you food and whatnot. Just stay put.

When it comes down to it, Ryuseitai was still my old home. I don’t really want to fight with you guys either, m’kay?
{% endbubble %}

{% img /img/es/eventstory/supervillain/shinobuorigcg.jpg %}

{% bubble Shinobu sad %}
<th>(Ughh… Seriously, what is going on here…? What is happening in Okinawa…!?)</th>

<th>(The deadly war that was the SS is already over, so peace should have returned here…)</th>

<th>(That is why, based on the policy of ES, it seems that starting from the coming year, some form of ES branch will be established in the regions where the SS qualifying rounds took place.)</th>

<th>(SS was the sole domain of ES, after all… ES beat all the local powerhouses in the qualifying rounds, proved its capabilities, and spread its influence across each region.)</th>

<th>(They are trying to maintain this momentum in order to conquer the whole country.)</th>

<th>(They will create branches in each region, which will then join forces with each other to spread their dominance throughout the nation.)</th>

<th>(However, I heard that the construction of the branch in Okinawa was not able to commence due to the strong opposition of the local people.)</th>

<th>(Even now in Okinawa, the local idols are doing quite well, it seems. But that is exactly why—)</th>

—Tetora-kun.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora vside %}
Mm, what is it? Do you need the bathroom or something?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shinobu serious %}
Ah, no, I’m alright. Tetora-kun, I have one question I would like you to answer, at the very least.
{% endbubble %}

{% img /img/es/eventstory/supervillain/darkstarch6_3.jpg %}

{% bubble Tetora vside %}
And what would that be? I guess I’ll answer it if I can.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shinobu serious %}
Tetora-kun, are you still a member of Ryuseitai?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora vside %}
………
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shinobu worried %}
There has been strange news spreading that you will quit the unit and make your own group… is that simply unfounded gossip?

I have come here to ascertain the truth behind those rumors. We have been anxious to know, as we could not get in contact with you for some reason.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora frown %}
…You *do* know my situation, right?

When it was decided that we would return to the previous formation, with Morisawa-senpai in the center of Ryuseitai—

All the new members the three of us had inducted into this unit and fostered on our own… Every single one of them decided to leave Ryuseitai.

Some then made their own units, some are still in the process of finding their position, and some… simply got sick of it all, and quit being an idol altogether.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shinobu sad %}
………
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora vside %}
And most of the members who split from the unit — or in other words, those who were to inherit the blood of Ryuseitai — created a group known as “Anti-Stars”.

The ones that gathered to this unit were some of the wilder troublemakers of Ryuseitai-N, the group that I was a leader of.

I’m sure you can tell from the meaning behind the name, “to deny the stars” — Anti-Stars have a grudge against Ryuseitai.

They loathe us. It’s only natural, and we have no choice but to accept their hatred.

We did horrible, awful things to those kids.

We gave them so much hope, only to waste time within their precious youth that they have but one chance to experience… and then, we mercilessly threw them away, leaving them empty-handed.

We deserve to be punched in the face by their rage. Don’t you think so?
{% endbubble %}

## Chapter 7

{% bubble Tetora vside %}
I mean, I came all this way just to get beat up by them.

All the members of Anti-Stars left ES and found a new home here in Okinawa, the prefecture that stubbornly continues to resist ES.

Then they joined this entertainment agency, Crimson Production, which has become the largest force in the region. Just recently, actually. I think it was right after SS.

In here, you’ll find tons of determined local idols, who haven’t lost their spirit even after they were ripped to pieces by ES during SS.

I think that’s why the former Ryuseitai-N kids, who are also anti-ES, saw this agency as a place they can thrive.

ES has been steadily expanding its reach nationwide, but because of their overly-aggressive methods, there has been a rise in what you could call “anti-ES groups” in various parts of the country.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shinobu worried %}
T-That is why… you could not overlook the fact that the former Ryuseitai-N members joined such a dangerous group?

Thus, you have come here to tell them to stop doing something so ridiculous, correct?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora vside %}
What, so that I can tell them off? So that I can say, “there’s no way you guys can win, anyway”?

Well, that *is* how I explained it to ES and Taichou. On paper, I *am* an emissary whose purpose is to coordinate ES and Crimson Production.

ES is trying to subdue anti-ES organizations such as Crimson Production by offering them technology and funds.

It’s easier to silence them with money and the like than to start an all-out war.
{% endbubble %}

{% img /img/es/eventstory/supervillain/darkstarch7_1.jpg %}

{% bubble Tetora vside %}
As the guy who once led Ryuseitai-N, I was the perfect choice for the job of placating Crimson Production, since it has many former members of that unit.

And some of the former Ryuseitai-N kids actually *wanted* me to come over, anyway.

They asked me to save them. Crimson Production is an anti-ES group, after all. The former ES members of Anti-Stars feel inferior by default.

With such a distressing situation they’ve found themselves in, they can’t seem to do their practice sessions or work properly, either. And so, they asked me for advice on what they should do.

Even though I no longer have any authority, nor am I even a leader anymore, they came to <em>me</em>.

I can’t just ignore their pleas, you know? I didn’t even once think, “You all betrayed ES, and now you’re asking *this* from me?”

If they’re in trouble — if they call for my help, I’ll drop everything and come rushing for their sake.

That’s the least I can do for them, if nothing else.  …Do you have any problems with that, Sengoku-kun?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shinobu worried %}
For now, I would simply like you to cease speaking to me like we’re strangers, including that strange tone of yours… Anyway, erm, is that why you came to Okinawa, Tetora-kun?

You are here to save your former teammates… to protect your former subordinates once and for all, whom you once failed to protect and caused to suffer horribly.

<th>(Hmm… Did he slowly get dyed by those ideas the more he came into contact with these kids, who have been entrenched in anti-ES ideology…?)</th>

<th>(Is that why his persona has changed so drastically?)</th>

<th>(Tetora-kun’s so pure and straight-forward, and he always absorbs everything he comes into contact with… That is how the black color comes to be, and it is most certainly his strong point, but…)</th>

<th>(I do not think he should absorb dangerous ideas as well and make them his own, to the point that he is entirely tainted by them.)</th>

<th>(Has he truly become a villain — an enemy of ES by being stained with anti-ES ideology?)</th>

<th>(No, that cannot be… He isn’t a character from a comic book or something…)</th>

<th>(Is it even possible for a person to change so easily, in the same vein as a hero of justice who has been brainwashed and turned evil…?)</th>

<th>(Something is not right here. There is something very off about all of this.)</th>
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora smile %}
—Oh, I have to go now. My pals are calling for me.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shinobu idle %}
…? Could it be — Have Shinkai-dono and the other members arrived?
{% endbubble %}

{% img /img/es/eventstory/supervillain/darkstarch7_2.jpg %}

{% bubble Tetora smile %}
Ah, you misunderstand. The people I consider my comrades now are the guys from Crimson Production.

Oh yeah, I’ll answer your question from earlier now. You asked me if I’m still a member of Ryuseitai, right, Sengoku-kun?

On paper, that would of course be “yes”. I haven’t submitted a unit withdrawal form yet, nor my resignation from ES to the office.

I’m still Nagumo Tetora, Ryuseitai’s Ryusei Black.

But, hmm… If I were to put aside what the documents say for a moment, and only consider the emotional aspect of that statement — I don’t know how true that really is.

I don’t think I can say that I’m on your side now.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shinobu worried %}
What on earth…? You really *have* been tainted by a dangerous ideology—
{% endbubble %}

{% img /img/es/eventstory/supervillain/darkstarch7_3.jpg %}

{% bubble Tetora smile2 %}
Haha. What dangerous ideology?

We have people here who just want to live a normal, peaceful life — and then we have ES, who’s trying to force the whole world to be dyed in their color.

So tell me, which side is the one with the dangerous ideologies? Who’s the real villain here, hmm?

{% bubble Chiaki worried %}
Yup! Now that you’ve come to accept that, get up, Takamine! We’ve got trouble!

{% bubble Midori sigh %}
What do you want, seriously… I apologize for neglecting everyone yesterday by prioritizing my own personal work, okay?

I’m begging you, please don’t terrorize my peaceful daily life… Are you two a natural disaster or kaijuu or something?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki grin %}
Why, of *course* we aren’t kaijuu! We’re heroes of justice! We’re trying our hardest to be that!

However! You have to take a look at this! This is the latest news article published online—
{% endbubble %}

{% img /img/es/eventstory/supervillain/darkstarch8_3.jpg %}

{% bubble Midori worried %}
Mm…?

Wha— What is this…?

“Following after Nagumo Tetora, Sengoku Shinobu also leaves Ryuseitai!?”

“The mystery deepens! Ryuseitai, the unit that was said to be the oldest powerhouse in Yumenosaki Academy, is unable to stop its impending disintegration” — Mmm~?

What? What's going on here? Why’s the situation getting even *worse* before our very eyes…?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki frown2 %}
Naturally, we’re puzzled too! Yesterday, we had Sengoku fly to Okinawa to investigate the situation—

But then he found himself in some kind of trouble, and we never heard from him again.

I can’t even reach a signal, no matter how many times I phone him.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori idle %}
It’s not ‘cause you were so annoying that he blocked you… right?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki grin %}
Nope! I think it’s only you who’d do something as cruel as that to me, Takamine!

I’ll have you know, it’s a burden on me to always have to relay my messages to other people like Kanata whenever I want to contact you!
{% endbubble %}

{% img /img/es/eventstory/supervillain/darkstarch8_4.jpg %}

{% bubble Midori idle %}
It’s an honor to know that I was able to become special to you, Senpai.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki grin %}
Mhm! I’d love it if we could become special in a more positive way! You little rascal~! ♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata idle %}
mm, so, we were [worried] about shinobu since [yesterday]. and once it became today — as you can see, this is what ended up happening.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori sigh %}
And that’s why it’s now sounding like even Shinobu-kun is quitting Ryuseitai for whatever reason, huh…?

But I mean… This is just fake news, isn’t it?

A lot has happened, so I guess it kinda makes sense in Tetora-kun’s case, but… Shinobu-kun would never abandon Ryuseitai under any circumstances, so…

Actually, you could probably say that if even *Shinobu-kun* of all people gave up on Ryuseitai, then we really *are* done for.

It’ll mean we’ve become the absolute worst group in the world, that even Shinobu-kun, who finds good in everything, can’t find any good in us at all.
{% endbubble %}

{% img /img/es/eventstory/supervillain/darkstarch8_5.jpg %}

{% bubble Chiaki frown %}
Yeah… It’s hard for me to believe, too. But you’ll find a picture of Nagumo and Sengoku shoulder-to-shoulder in this article, smiling and posing together.

They’re both wearing idol costumes from Crimson Production, the agency that Nagumo was transferred to.

If one were to say that this is proof that the two have left Ryuseitai and belong to a new group, it would be hard to deny that statement.

Or rather, that’s what the article is trying to make you think.

While the interview in the article could be easily faked, a photo like this can’t.

Well, to be more specific — with today’s technology, people can easily edit two different photos together, but I don’t understand why they would do such a thing.

Something is definitely going down in Okinawa.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata frown %}
well, we already knew since [yesterday] that something is going on there. but it sounds much more alarming than we first expected, yes?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki serious %}
Yeah. It seems that the upper management of the agency is just as perplexed about this matter, and I’ve had numerous inquiries coming in since this morning, asking us what’s going on with Ryuseitai.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata frown2 %}
*we* are the ones who want to ask that, you know~?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki serious %}
Yeah, seriously. Regardless, I’m sure even you understand that we can’t just stand around and do nothing, right, Takamine?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori idle %}
Well, yeah, obviously… But what’re you even planning to do? You can’t get contact with either of them, right?

You’re not gonna suggest going to Okinawa ourselves to find out, are you…?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki grin %}
Yep, that is *exactly* what we’ll do! Worry not, Takamine! I’ve already contacted our agency, and any staff involved with our jobs!

We can now leave our work aside, and focus on the main issue at hand!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori sweat %}
It’s only when it’s least necessary that he’s super fast to work…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki frown2 %}
In fact, this is what I should’ve done yesterday! I regret not taking action earlier…! Due to my careless decisions, even Sengoku has fallen prey to them!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori worried %}
Erm, he’s not dead or anything though, right? Isn’t he smiling and making a peace sign in the photo…?

And anyway, I dunno what’s going on in Okinawa, but won’t the same happen to us if we head over there…?

Won’t we also look like we ended up quitting Ryuseitai…?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki serious %}
That’s definitely a possibility. But just in case, I asked Tenshouin to officially deny it all should such news spread.

StarPro should protect their own agency’s idols, at least from time to time.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata v2 %}
fufu. mr. [emperor] is a [nuisance] when he turns against you, but he is very reliable when he is your [ally], isn’t he?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki serious %}
Yeah. Although, we shouldn’t assume that he’s completely on our side.

He’d probably cut us off just as easily if it’s in the best interest of the whole agency.

However, that’s exactly why, while we’re still one of the most valuable assets that he and the agency must keep protected—

While we’re still Ryuseitai, one of the biggest money-makers in StarPro—

We *have* to solve this unprecedented problem.
{% endbubble %}

## Chapter 1

{% img /img/es/eventstory/supervillain/supersizedvillainch1_1.jpg %}

<div class="msr-narration">
    <p>Later in the day. In Okinawa, within the forested area, where Crimson Production resides…</p>
</div>

{% bubble Chiaki thinking %}
—Hmm… I knew it, so it really *was* that all along.

It isn’t that Nagumo and Sengoku weren’t getting into contact with us. It wasn’t because of their own personal reasons.

It’s just that they *couldn’t* contact us, even if they wanted to…

It seems like there’s some kind of signal jam around the Crimson Production headquarters.

That’s why no phone calls make it through from inside or near the building.
{% endbubble %}

{% img /img/es/eventstory/supervillain/supersizedvillainch1_2.jpg %}

{% bubble Chiaki frown2 %}
My initial guess was that Nagumo and Sengoku had their phones confiscated and then destroyed, but… It seems like it’s a lot more dangerous than I had originally anticipated.

A signal-jamming generator, of all things… At this point, you may as well tell me we’re in a tokusatsu or sci-fi story. It’s even capable of finding great use as a military weapon.

Speaking of which, Sengoku mentioned that the headquarters building looks like a military facility…

That wasn’t even an exaggeration. His intuition was spot on.

And now that I know that Nagumo and Sengoku have fallen into the pockets of dangerous people, who’re handling such a weapon without a care in the world… This makes me all the more worried.

This is no longer a problem I can solve on my own…

I have to hurry back to Tenshouin and — no, actually, I need to report this to ES as a whole, and ask them to take care of it.

Oh! Before I do that, I should contact my comrades, since they’re working separately from me. I need to let them know what’s going on and have them retreat.

Hmm… Alright, moving this far away from the headquarters building seems to be enough to get a signal. There’s only one bar on my phone, but it’s better than nothing.

Hello, Kanata? Takamine’s with you, right?

Yeah, it looks worse than we expected. I’m planning to get out of here immediately, so you guys pack your bags and get to the airport as soon as possi—
{% endbubble %}

{% img /img/es/eventstory/supervillain/supersizedvillainch1_3.jpg %}

{% bubble Tetora vside %}
—You talk to yourself a lot, “Taichou”.

The cameras aren’t even rolling, you know. Are you in the habit of being unnecessarily cautious because the “audience” won’t understand what you’re thinking unless you say it out loud?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki idle %}
…Nagumo.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora smile %}
Heya, Taichou.

I knew you’d come. I was right to lay down a trap.

It’s only natural you’d show up. There’s no way you’d be so heartless as to leave all the work to me and Sengoku-kun.

If we don’t report, contact, or consult you, you’ll grow anxious and come to check on us yourself, right?

You’ve always been exactly like an overprotective parent.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki smile2 %}
Nagumo… I’m so glad to see you’re doing alright.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora curious %}
Hah?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki v2 %}
At the very least, I’m glad to confirm that you’re safe. How’s Sengoku? He’s not hurt, is he?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora angry2 %}
Do you even *know* what’s going on here?

You’re trespassing on private property. I have the authority to detain and interrogate you.

I’m now in a position similar to an executive staff member of Crimson Production for a number of reasons. I may be a part-time employee, but I’m registered as an official staff member.

And neither ES nor Ryuseitai prohibits us from having side jobs, right?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki smile3 %}
Yeah, of course not. I see, so you got yourself a job. Mhm, that’s something to be happy about.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora frown %}
I’m more like a part-timer. But well, there are many people in the world who want to work, but can’t get a job, so…

I’m grateful enough to have someone hire and pay me, no matter how exploitative the corporation is.

…Ah, but I shouldn’t say anything bad about the company. It’ll affect my assessment. You never know who’s listening.
{% endbubble %}

{% img /img/es/eventstory/supervillain/supersizedvillainch1_4.jpg %}

{% bubble Tetora vside %}
Anyway, I don’t have time to waste on idle chit-chat, so… I’m sorry to say this, but I’m going to have to restrain you.

That’s my job now as an employee in Crimson Production.

Don’t try to resist or escape at all costs.

If you do, I’ll have to hurt you.

I technically do owe you a debt of gratitude for picking me up and raising me. I respect you, and have compassion for you, as we’ve been close comrades for a long time.

That’s why, I’d rather avoid resorting to hurting you.
{% endbubble %}

## Chapter 2

{% bubble Chiaki serious %}
………
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora serious %}
I doubt you noticed, but — as of this moment, Crimson Production’s combatants are lurking in the bushes around here.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki v2 %}
Haha. Combatants, huh? Are we in a tokusatsu?[^6]
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora frown %}
*You’re* the one saying that? That’s just what I call them, really. They’re basically fighters who’re willing to do the dirty work of spilling blood.

In tokusatsu shows, combatants are small fry that can be KO’d with a single punch — but I assume you at least know that in a real life situation, you should never go against them, right?

They have no resistance to violence. If anything, they train day and night just to hone their physical strength.

I’m sure you’re aware that an ordinary person like you, without any superpowers, can’t win against them in a fight.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki smile3 %}
Well, I’m not much of a fighter to begin with, so I wouldn’t really be able to win in a fistfight if I were up against an adult.

I did have the basics of self-defense drilled into me by Kiryu in our Circle, though.

He does teach me a bit of martial arts that are more for playing pretend, but…

When it comes to actual real life situations, all he ever tells me is, “If you ever encounter an assaulter, you should yell for help or run away immediately.”
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora idle %}
Did he ever also tell you, “If they’re armed, you should surrender without any question and hand over whatever they want without provoking them.” — hm?

Because that’s exactly the position you’re in right now, Taichou.

You aren’t strong enough to oppose our attacks. You have no choice but to stay put and obey our command.

The situation is overwhelmingly in our favor. I’d rather not waste energy grappling with you, so I’d much appreciate it if you’d do as I say and let us take you in quietly.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki serious %}
…And if I don’t comply?
{% endbubble %}

{% img /img/es/eventstory/supervillain/supersizedvillainch2_1.jpg %}

{% bubble Tetora angry2 %}
…? Were you always *this* stupid…?

If you don’t, this is what’s gonna happen.
{% endbubble %}

<div class="msr-narration">
    <p>(Sound of a punch)</p>
</div>

{% bubble Chiaki shocked %}
—…!
{% endbubble %}

{% img /img/es/eventstory/supervillain/chiakiorigcg.jpg %}

{% bubble Chiaki svocg %}
… … ………
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora smile3 %}
Haha. Taken aback, are you, Taichou? I’m sure you’ve experienced a lot of flashy battles in tokusatsu, but is this seriously the very first time you’ve *actually* been punched or something?

Or, what? Did you really think I wouldn’t actually hit you?
{% endbubble %}

{% img /img/es/eventstory/supervillain/supersizedvillainch2_2.jpg %}

{% bubble Tetora angry2 %}
Either way, you’re always *so* naive!

You need to wake up already! You should at least know the difference between reality and fantasy!

We aren’t in a tokusatsu show here!

I’m so *sick* and tired of being subjected to your hobbies!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki sad3 %}
Nagumo… Guh— <th><em>(cough, cough)</em></th>…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora smile2 %}
Ahh, sorry. I punched you in the chest — are you in pain from a bruised lung?

If you stop being able to breathe properly, you won’t be able to get oxygen to your body, making it harder to move. You won’t even be able to call for help because you’re in too much pain to scream. Efficient, isn’t it?

If you still choose to resist, then I’ll have no choice but to strangle you until you lose consciousness.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki sigh2 %}
…I only have one thing to say, Nagumo.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora smile %}
Whoa, you can still talk, huh? You’ve got guts, I’ll give you that. I didn’t hold back at all with that punch.

So? What is it? Is it time to hear the sore loser say his last words?

Or are you going to lecture me now? “Stop with all these cruel acts! You’re supposed to be a good boy!”
{% endbubble %}

{% img /img/es/eventstory/supervillain/supersizedvillainch2_3.jpg %}

{% bubble Tetora smile %}
Hahaha. That would be *so* funny.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki idle %}
No, even *I’m* aware that it’s pointless to give you a wholehearted lecture.

Now that you’ve been tainted with evil.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora idle %}
………
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki serious %}
But, yes, I’d like to be a “sore loser,” as you put it.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora smile %}
Fine by me. I can’t wait to see the sort of cursing you, a good little boy, can come up with.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki frown %}
I’m sorry, Nagumo.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora curious %}
…? Why are you apologizing?

Haha. We've had this same exchange before, haven’t we?

But unlike how it was then, this time around was no accident. I hit you with full ill-intent.

Though, I was still a hero back then, and right now, I’m a villain to the very core.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki smile2 %}
Yeah, you surprisingly suit that role as well, Nagumo.

I may have been destroying your potential for the sake of my dreams all this time.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora frown %}
*That’s* what you want to apologize for? You didn’t drag me in by the collar, nor force me to do anything. I chose this path on my own, m’kay?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki idle %}
But you didn’t like being here originally, right? Back when you first joined Ryuseitai.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora idle %}
Yeah, but all those feelings disappeared half-way. I did everything because I enjoyed it.

I even thought that the heroes you admired matched the ideal that I should aspire to be.

The ideal man among men, that I’ve been striving to become since I was a little kid.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki smile2 %}
Ah, I see. How about now?

Is there still a hero at the end of the path you’re walking?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora sad %}
I don’t know. …I’m not sure anymore.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki smile3 %}
—Excuse me for changing the subject, but… I used to get bullied often in the past.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora curious %}
……?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki frown %}
I’ve never told you guys much about it because I was so ashamed, but—

Ryuseitai used to be a horrible unit back then.[^7]
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora idle %}
Even compared to the present Ryuseitai, at its current abysmal state?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki serious %}
Yeah, even compared to that. No one took their activities or lessons seriously, and yet they would always put on airs by misusing the reputation of being in “Yumenosaki’s oldest idol unit”.

They gained profits and fame just by leeching off of that reputation. That was how the Ryuseitai members of the past would continuously play around and squander what they had gained.

They indulged in their pleasures without ever bothering to do anything troublesome or difficult.

It’s ridiculous to study, take lessons, and work wholeheartedly. It’s foolish and wrong to spend your precious youth, that you can only experience once, on tiring tasks.

It’s right to laugh and behave foolishly, throw away irritating obligations, skip classes, and play around all day.

That was the form of justice that Ryuseitai believed in, once upon a time.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora idle %}
………
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki frown %}
I was the villain who defied the justice of that Ryuseitai.

I just couldn’t read the room… I kept calling over everyone who was unwilling to do their best and kept trying to tell them to straighten up… so they saw me as an absolute pain.

That’s how I became the target of bullying. Whenever I came face to face with everyone in Ryuseitai, who were supposed to be my comrades, they would only poke fun and laugh at me.

I became someone against justice, who deserved to be kicked and cursed at — in other words, an evil monster.
{% endbubble %}

{% img /img/es/eventstory/supervillain/supersizedvillainch2_4.jpg %}

{% bubble Chiaki sad %}
That was why I was forced to do all their tedious jobs and homework, day in and day out.

Among many things they forced me to do, one of them was cleaning the pool in the middle of the night, all on my own.

It was agonizing… It was hell itself.

Of course, there are a lot of people in the world who are much worse off than I was.

There were even people like that in the very same school. I may have been bullied, but it was nothing compared to what the Five Eccentrics were subjected to.

That’s why I couldn’t complain to anyone. I just couldn't let myself whine — about how hard it was, about how much I couldn’t stand it anymore — as if I was some sort of wuss.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora idle %}
………
{% endbubble %}

## Chapter 3

{% bubble Chiaki serious %}
That’s why I tried to get through the days by always pretending to be an idiot who didn’t think or feel anything. I just smiled and laughed, convincing myself that I was happy.
{% endbubble %}

{% img /img/es/eventstory/supervillain/supersizedvillainch3_1.jpg %}

{% bubble Chiaki smile2 %}
And then, on that starry night — I met Kanata, who had lived a much more pitiful life than I, and had never been treated as a human being—

That mask of mine, of a crudely drawn smile, was completely smashed to pieces by Kiryu and Akehoshi—

And like a miracle, I “transformed” into the hero I had always yearned to be, even if only for a mere moment.

And with the help of the kind-hearted villains, Akatsuki, who went along with my farce… I was able to build up the Ryuseitai of today.

The Ryuseitai that I dreamed of.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora frown %}
…What the hell have you been on about?

Do you think I’m going to take pity and go easy on you just because you revealed your shameful past?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki smile3 %}
Yeah, I wonder why I’m saying all of this… Mhm, you’re right, this has nothing to do with anything.

But it’s something I should have told you before, and it felt like the opportunity to mention it presented itself.

In fact, I apologize for taking so long to tell you. I’m sorry.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora idle %}
Mm… It’s very different from what I’ve heard from Shinkai-senpai. From his point of view, Taichou was a super cool hero from the beginning to the end.

I had no idea about how you were “before transformation”.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki sad %}
The reason he never told you about it is likely all my fault.

Ryuseitai is indeed the oldest idol unit in Yumenosaki Academy. It’s a veteran powerhouse with history and tradition.

But the ideal Ryuseitai that everyone loves and the agency wants is something that I forcibly created in my generation.

A dream that a bullied, cowardly tokusatsu nerd dreamed of, that just so happened to become a reality.

But a dream is nothing but a dream. You have to wake up someday.

No, in fact… I should have properly ended my dream when I had passed the leadership position to you.

I should have given my story a proper ending and handed over my place to the next lead star, the hero of the new era.

Just like the tokusatsu heroes I love so much.

That’s why, I’m so sorry, Nagumo. This whole year’s messy development is all my fault — It’s all because I never properly settled these things.
{% endbubble %}

{% img /img/es/eventstory/supervillain/supersizedvillainch3_2.jpg %}

{% bubble Tetora sad %}
Why the hell do you keep apologizing!? It pisses me off!

“What went wrong?” “Why have we turned out this way?”

We’ve gone through this so many times by now, over and over and *over* again.

Yet… we never managed to come to a conclusion. There’s no point in dredging up the past. Maybe we could at least brace ourselves to avoid repeating the same mistakes, but…

It’s unproductive, and in reality, just pointless. No amount of regret will change our situation.

That’s why I—

……!?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki idle %}
What’s wrong, Nagumo? Is there trouble?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora surprised %}
A messenger is here… He says there are trespassers breaking into the headquarters building of Crimson Production as we speak.

Hold on… No, don’t tell me the reason you’ve been blabbering on endlessly was to—
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki smile3 %}
Mhm, I wanted to apologize for that too. Sorry, sorry.

I’ve said this many times already, but I used to be a victim of bullying. That’s why I’m pretty sensitive when it comes to malicious intent.

We live in a world in which the weak are meat; the strong do eat. Weak meat like me had to be extremely vigilant to avoid being eaten. I wouldn’t have survived otherwise.

That’s why I was already aware that you were approaching and surrounding me, even before you spoke to me.

I intentionally spoke aloud for that reason, and lied to you as if Kanata and Takamine were on standby somewhere else.

I was intentionally misinforming you guys.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora angry2 %}
Ugh, I was wondering why you were all alone when you’re such a pushover—

—This guy’s a decoy! There are other guys from Ryuseitai breaking in! Don’t let them get away! Capture them all!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki smile3 %}
Fuhaha! It’s too late to panic now.

There’s no signal in this area. None of you can use your phones either, so the only way to communicate is to send a messenger.

Your colleagues over in the headquarters building won’t be able to respond fast enough to the crisis.

And I’m sure that, now that Kanata and Takamine broke into the building, they’ve already made contact with Sengoku and rescued him from his confinement.

I don’t know what sort of situation Sengoku is in right now, but he is the only one who would *never* betray Ryuseitai. Even now, he’s bound to be on our side.

They’ll have joined forces with Sengoku, and since he’s good at gathering information, they’ll continue to investigate the building.

Since it’s your headquarters, that means that there’s a possibility of finding information that could destroy your footing, such as evidence of illegal acts.

If we can secure it and escape safely, it’ll be our victory.

Crimson Production would collapse and go bankrupt. And you, as an employee of this corporation, would be able to wash your hands from all the evil.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora angry2 %}
…And here I thought you were nothing but an idiot…

So what? Sure, we’ve taken your bait, and now security at the headquarters is a little thin. And sure, maybe you’ll be able to at least get in touch with Sengoku-kun, or search the building.

But that doesn't change your situation.

You’re surrounded by a group of people who aren’t afraid to use violence, and you’ve clearly provoked them — by declaring war.

Are you a dumbass, or what? Did you not consider we could just kill you for making us snap? Just how much of a pacifistic idiot are you?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki smile3 %}
Don’t look down on your older brother so much, Nagumo.

Our generation has survived the Yumenosaki War Era, days that you’ve never experienced. A war that was fought, full of deceit.

“Pacifistic idiot”? Just *who* do you think you’re talking to, junior?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora angry %}
………
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki smile2 %}
I wouldn’t ever barge into a dangerous place like this without any precautions or preparation in the first place.

Regardless, even if I *do* get killed or otherwise disappear, Tenshouin will make his move. I made sure those arrangements were set in place before we left.

Tenshouin is someone I can ask for that sort of favor, because he’s my friend.

And if the supreme Tenshouin Zaibatsu comes into play here, the fate of Crimson Production would soon be in dire state.

*That’s* when you’ll truly be doomed. They’ll absolutely investigate all of you thoroughly, count up all your sins, and crush you.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora angry %}
………
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki smile2 %}
I’ll say it a hundred times more. This time, it’s my victory — *our* victory, Nagumo.

Your biggest mistake was to choose the path of evil. And typically, this isn’t something said to the loser, but—

I choose to deliberately tell you, my immature and foolish junior, my favorite phrase:

—Justice will always prevail.
{% endbubble %}

## Chapter 4

{% img /img/es/eventstory/supervillain/supersizedvillainch4_1.jpg %}

<div class="msr-narration">
    <p>An hour later. Inside Crimson Production’s agency office…</p>
</div>

{% bubble Midori sigh %}
I’m so sorry, Morisawa-senpai.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata sigh %}
our plan was a [complete failure].
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shinobu sigh %}
We were all captured in mere seconds…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki surprised %}
You guys…!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora grin %}
Ahahahahaha!!

Hey, Taichou, what were you just telling me oh-so-proudly earlier? “It’s our victory”? “Justice will always prevail”?

So I wouldn’t be wrong to assume that this means that Crimson Production is on the side of justice, would I?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki frown2 %}
Guhhh… This is so frustrating. There’s nothing I can even say to counter that…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori smile2 %}
Just seeing Morisawa-senpai this frustrated brings me joy somehow.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki surprised %}
W-Why, Takamine!? Why are you happy!? I don’t recall ever raising you to be such a mean-spirited boy, who would laugh at other people’s demise!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori v2 %}
I don’t recall being raised by you, either.

But I mean, who wouldn’t laugh at this situation?

—Hey, um, so… I don’t really get what’s going on here, but how much of this was an act, in the end…?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora vside %}
………
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shinobu v2 %}
It is all right, Tetora-kun. I have been locked up here ever since I was captured—

But because you tied me up so loosely, I was able to discreetly free myself by utilizing Ninpou: Rope-removal Jutsu.

I took advantage of any opportunity that I wasn’t being watched to thoroughly observe the office. I investigated all the positions and angles of the surveillance cameras, as well as sound recording devices, until I had a perfect grasp of their effect range.

As long as we speak quietly in the corner of this room, there is no possibility that anyone else can hear what we are saying.

However, since the surveillance cameras will catch a glimpse of us, it would be better for you to continue looking like a scary villain, if possible.

You will need to maintain a villainous demeanor in your posture and manner of speaking, as well.

After all, while you may have been able to clear the area by telling everyone that you’ll be the one to interrogate us, we do not know when the Crimson Production staff will come back.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora smile %}
Okay. I’ve gotten used to speaking in this tone now, anyway. I used to talk like this when I was young, and it’s starting to come back to me.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori smile %}
Ahh, I didn’t know you used to talk normally when you were young. Makes sense, though.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora idle %}
Yeah, I was trained thoroughly to speak that way when I started learning karate, or well, it’s just that it became so natural to start saying “Ossu” and the like.

In Shinkai-senpai’s case, it feels as though he may have been this way for a long time — but “Shinobu-kun” didn’t always speak like a ninja either, did he?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shinobu v2 %}
Mhm… Ehehe, Tetora-kun with a normal tone of voice has a slightly different and dangerous charm to it. I think it’s lovely!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori worried %}
Ehh~… I dunno what it is, but I don’t really vibe with this Tetora-kun… He’s got that shallow energy of someone who I’d never be able to understand, and neither would he to me.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora frown %}
I mean, if we weren’t in the same unit, I doubt we’d have ever spoken to each other in the first place, you feel me?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori smile %}
Yeah, I know what you mean… Fate’s really a strange thing, isn’t it?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata curious %}
…um. i do not think i fully [understand].

so, in the end, what does this mean?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora smile %}
That’s a pretty vague question, huh? But I know what you’re trying to ask.

To put it very briefly: I’m basically an undercover agent sent by ES.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shinobu v2 %}
He’s a ninja, a ninja! ♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora idle %}
Well, more specifically, I’m a spy. Now that ES is dead-set on a nationwide domination, there has naturally been an emergence of resistance groups throughout the country since SS — the “anti-ES organizations,” so to speak. ES finds them to be an eyesore.

They consider them a hindrance, like this agency we have here, Crimson Production.

That’s why they’re trying to destroy them. Preferably by exposing their corruption and criticizing their acts in front of the public, by fair means.

So when Anti-Stars, my juniors from the former Ryuseitai, asked for my help, I was selected as the person in charge.

And then I was dispatched to Okinawa, under the guise of consulting with Anti-Stars, since they had been incorporated into Crimson Production.

That was the sort of pretext I was working under.

In other words, that’s just the surface. Behind the scenes, though, I was actually asked by ES to spy on Crimson Production, an anti-ES organization.
