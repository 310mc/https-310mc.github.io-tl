## Chapter 9

{% img /img/es/eventstory/supervillain/supersizedvillainch9_1.jpg %}

<div class="msr-narration">
    <p>Next morning. In the agency office of Crimson Production’s headquarters…</p>
</div>

{% bubble Tetora idle %}
<th>(The evil organization starts their morning early.)</th>

<th>(Every morning, you begin by greeting everyone energetically.)</th>
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki grin %}
Gooood mooorniiing!!

Morisawa Chiaki from RB, ready for duty!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora idle %}
<th>(You press the timestamp machine to record your attendance, and present yourself to your boss. Then, you ask what you’re supposed to do for the day.)</th>

<th>(As of this moment, the boss in question would be me, the commander of RB.)</th>

Good job.

It’s good that you have energy, but your voice is a little too loud. Keep it down.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki grin %}
Yes, sir! I’m very sorry about that! I’m still not used to working at Crimson Production!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora frown2 %}
No excuses. When you’re scolded—
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki grin %}
I must apologize! It’s all my fault, sir! I’m so sorry!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora idle %}
<th>(You must obey your unreasonable, power-hungry boss. You must never complain.)</th>

<th>(This is the key to succeeding in this company.)</th>

<th>(In fact, these are the conditions set in order to be accepted as part of the team.)</th>

<th>(Those below must obey those that are above. In the same sense as a sports team[^1] — as long as you understand how the beasts of the jungle operate—)</th>
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata v2 %}
good mooorning~!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shinobu v2 %}
Shinkai Kanata and Sengoku Shinobu from RB, reporting for duty!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora idle %}
Good. …There’s still one person missing, though?

Is “Takamine” skipping out on work?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata thinking %}
ah~… midori appears to be feeling [unwell].
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shinobu %}
Indeed, he did not seem to have any energy. Maybe he caught a cold from the sudden change in environment?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora frown %}
That’s still inexcusable. All of you, including “Morisawa” — Follow after me. We’ll shake him out of bed.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki grin %}
Roger that, Taichou!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shinobu v2 %}
As you command, O magnificent RB-Taichou!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora frown2 %}
There’s no need for flattery. If you have the time to butter me up, you’re better off spending it doing your job.

We don’t have enough hands in Crimson Production as it is, do you understand?

You lot are just replacements to fill our shortage in staff. You’ll be dispatched to your respective departments according to my instruction.

There, you’ll be performing minor chores for us.

<th>(…And this is how they’ll be able to go in and out of various departments and explore the inner workings of Crimson Production in greater depth and detail. Since the work will be divided between the five of us, our investigation will advance at rapid speed.)</th>

<th>(We’ll be able to gather assets to attack Crimson Production far more sharply and effectively.)</th>

…Of course, that won’t be your primary job.

When I call for you, you must put aside your other duties and assemble before me.

You will work as RB, idols representing Crimson Production, and earn money for the agency.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki grin %}
Yes, sir! Everything is for the sake of RB — for the glory of Ryuseitai Black!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata v2 %}
for [crimson production]!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shinobu v2 %}
For our magnificent Nagumo Tetora-Taichou!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora frown2 %}
Enough with the flattery already. Let’s just go and get the job done.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shinobu v2 %}
Ossu, roger that!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora sigh %}
<th>(<em>Sigh</em>… I feel like it’s way too obvious, as if they’re clearly forcing themselves to fit the role. Well, as long as nobody catches on that we’re only pretending to be evil.)</th>

<th>(And anyway… I’m sure it’ll be alright.)</th>

<th>(Surprisingly, nobody really cares much about what’s going on with other people.)</th>

<th>(I can’t speak for the fans who have been following us for a long time and paying attention to every detail…)</th>

<th>(But when it comes to the people here in Crimson Production — people who’ve become obsessed with anti-ES ideology…)</th>

<th>(People who’ve either been looking at us with a biased view from the beginning, or avoid looking at us entirely because they find us distasteful—)</th>

<th>(The more they steep in their hatred, the more blinded they become, unable to see anything but what they want to see. They only believe what they want to believe.)</th>

<th>(The only thing that matters to them is that we betrayed ES and switched over to Crimson Production.)</th>

<th>(Which means, to them, that we’re on their side.)</th>

<th>(The people here are short-sighted. They color-code the world according to whether they’re friend or foe, and assume that allies are good and enemies are evil.)</th>

<th>(…I used to live with a worldview as simple as that practically all my life, so to some extent, I can read the feelings and thoughts of these types of people. I can’t say I’m proud of that, though…)</th>

<th>(Of course, it’s no small matter that all of Ryuseitai has betrayed ES to join Crimson Production.)</th>

<th>(It honestly sounds too unlikely for it to be possible. We’re one of the main earners in ES, after all. It wouldn’t be weird to think, “How could such an important group of people turn on their previous company just like that?”)</th>

<th>(So I’m sure some of them will start to suspect us.)</th>

<th>(But there’s already Anti-Stars and I as legitimate proof that this is possible… and all of us were able to gain the trust of the Crimson Production staff over time.)</th>

<th>(So now, if I can succeed in leading the Ryuseitai members properly, they should also be able to blend in with Crimson Production.)</th>

<th>(In fact… That’s the very thing that we, RB—)</th>

<th>(The very mission that *Ryuseitai* must fulfill.)</th>

## Chapter 10

{% img /img/es/eventstory/supervillain/supersizedvillainch10_1.jpg %}

<div class="msr-narration">
    <p>A few minutes later. Within the Crimson Production building, at the film studio…</p>
</div>

{% bubble Kanata v2 %}
midori\~! come on out\~!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shinobu v2 %}
Your mother is crying for you!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki grin %}
You’re completely surrounded! There’s nowhere for you to escape! Fuhahahaha!! ☆
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori v2 %}
…You guys are just enjoying yourselves at this point.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora idle %}
Oh, there you are. Where were you even hiding?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori idle %}
There’s a hole under the building that’s big enough for me to hide in…

It was turned into a tunnel by the looks of it, and you can get to another area without being caught by the cameras…

Maybe they used it as an evacuation spot for the actors whenever gunpowder was used during filming… I wouldn’t really know, though.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora smile4 %}
Huh, I didn’t even know that existed. A tunnel… Maybe we could use it as an escape route, as a last resort.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori idle %}
Nah, I doubt this would connect all the way to the outside… They wouldn’t choose this place for our confinement if that was possible.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki idle %}
That would be a little too careless on their side, yeah.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori curious %}
Anyway, I did as you told me to… Was that enough?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora smile4 %}
Yeah. We were all supposed to come back here to call over “Midori-kun”, who refuses to come in for work.

Until we persuade him to come, we can move around freely. We can have private discussions here without being seen, since we also know where the surveillance cameras are.

They may catch on if we keep repeating this over and over again, but it should still be okay for now. Midori-kun’s famous for being the “unmotivated character”.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki smile2 %}
Yeah. In fact, it’s really surprising that even Takamine stuck around in this dangerous place. He could’ve run back to ES as soon as he had the chance…

He’s been a man with an element of surprise this time around.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori sigh2 %}
If you’re actually surprised, then that just means you never <em>once</em> understood me.

Besides, we all decided that we’d stay here together. I don’t wanna be the only one who’s left out.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki grin %}
Yeah. Let’s all work together to accomplish this mission.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata smile %}
chiaki~ you are not [allowed] to make any [orders]. tetora is the [taichou] right now.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki awkward %}
Ah, right. Sorry about that.

Nagumo, please don’t hesitate to order us around. We’ll follow your instructions.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora awkward %}
I’m not too keen on pushing even my own seniors around, but… I have to suck it up for now. We don’t have a choice.

—We betrayed ES.

First it was me, then “Shinobu-kun”, and then later on the other three defected one after the other.

We transferred to Crimson Production, a major entertainment agency that rules over Okinawa.

That’s what’s going to be announced to the public soon enough, and so far the people at Crimson Production don’t seem to suspect us.

Once we all moved to the new company, we changed our unit name from “Ryuseitai” to “RB”.

This is because we would’ve faced problems with procedures if we performed under the same name — Not to mention, our fans would’ve been confused, too.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori idle %}
We just went from “Ryuseitai” to “Ryuseitai Black”… I don’t feel like much has changed.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki grin %}
I like it, it reminds me of Kamen Rider!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora frown %}
I’m aware it’s a cheap name. I didn’t have the time to come up with something good, let alone the reason or need for it.

…I just badly wanted everyone to know how terrible the situation is.

Crimson Production is more or less an entertainment company, so on the front, it’s also involved in the production of programs and such.

And I got the opportunity to perform in their program as an idol, all the while being an undercover spy.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki idle %}
Ah, I get it now. The base of Crimson Production — as in, the headquarters building — is isolated from the outside world in terms of signals.

Letters and other forms of communication can easily be censored, and Okinawa is too far from ES for you to rush back here to relay information through normal methods.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora frown %}
Yeah, exactly. I didn’t have the means to inform anyone what was happening.

So I went on their program as an idol. That was the only way I could tell everyone what was going on.

If I made a questionable statement there, like saying that I’m leaving Ryuseitai, it would definitely become a topic of conversation. If it becomes a topic, all of you would then be able to get the information.

“A member of the powerhouse ‘Ryuseitai’ parted from ES.”

News like that is also really good for Crimson Production, since it’s an anti-ES organization.

They won’t manipulate the information. In fact, they would actively promote it.

And I knew everyone in Ryuseitai would come to this place themselves to confirm the situation as soon as they heard about this report.

Once you’ve arrived, I’d then capture you. Then, after I’ve handed you all the evidence I’ve gathered of Crimson Production’s illegal activities, I’d secretly let you escape out of here.

That was the original plan. From then, I’d just have to wait until ES got to work with the evidence of illegal activity, and have Crimson Production shut down for good.

And while stalling for time, I’d have to make sure that the evidence wouldn’t get destroyed.

All in order to defeat the evil organization, Crimson Production.
{% endbubble %}

## Chapter 11

{% note cw %}
**Content Warning:** The following chapters contain heavy discussion of self-loathing and self-destruction.
{% endnote %}

{% bubble Chiaki frown %}
You were going to cross a dangerous bridge… However, you concluded that Crimson Production can’t be defeated unless you do so, right?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora awkward %}
Maybe it was just a dumb plan thought up by an idiot… I just couldn’t think of any other way.

But I think I managed to make it work pretty well, if I do say so myself.

I mean, I genuinely had everyone convinced that I was a complete traitor, 100% anti-ES. I was careful not to let anyone know my true intentions.

After all, they would’ve killed me if they found out I was a spy. I was desperate to make this plan work.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori worried %}
I know I’m really late in saying this, but this isn’t even idol work anymore, is it?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora serious %}
Yeah, it really isn’t. I don’t think ES expected me to get this deeply involved, either.

I’m sure they thought I’d just gather the information they needed and get myself out of here.

But… I couldn’t abandon my old comrades, Anti-Stars, who were suffering in this place.

So I started thinking of ways to save those kids. I knew that in order to do that, I needed to expose the dark side of Crimson Production and have them shut down.

And I was going to do whatever I thought was necessary to achieve that.

As earnestly as possible, and with every ounce of effort in my body.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki smile %}
That’s exactly what makes you who you are, Nagumo. You really are an earnest and straight-forward boy.

However, the plan you devised is much too dangerous for you. You’re up against a criminal organization that’s as terrifying as an actual organized crime enterprise. You’d be dead in an instant were you to fail.

We cherish you as much as you cherish your own comrades, including those in Anti-Stars.

When you’re hurt or sad, we’re hurt and saddened just as much, if not more.

I know you couldn’t think of any other way this time, but if possible, please don’t cross such a dangerous bridge like this ever again.

While self-sacrifice is what makes a hero… Unlike me, you never wanted to become a hero, did you?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora idle %}
…Ossu. You’re the last person I’d ever want to preach to me about “not being self-sacrificial,” but…

All I ever wanted to be was someone I could be proud of — someone I could love.
{% endbubble %}

{% img /img/es/eventstory/supervillain/supersizedvillainch11_1.jpg %}

{% bubble Tetora sad2 %}
—I’ve always hated myself.

I’m sure you’ve all come to realize this about me by now, but I’ve always been extremely incompetent and stupid. No matter how hard I tried, I could never accomplish anything.

I had no capability of doing anything, and the harder I tried, the more I failed… The saying, “Love is our greatest teacher,” didn’t apply to me.

I love cooking, and I’ve been working hard on my cooking skills for a long time, but I’m sure you all know what the food I make is like.

I’m even aware that on the school trip, everyone put up with my food and forced themselves to eat it.[^2]

They ate every bit of it for my sake, with smiles on their faces, even though I’m sure it tasted awful…

But I was really, genuinely trying to make it taste good.
{% endbubble %}

{% img /img/es/eventstory/supervillain/supersizedvillainch11_2.jpg %}

{% bubble Tetora sad %}
That’s always how it’s been for me, for every single thing. I just couldn’t get anything right. It didn’t matter how hard I tried, it would all go to waste in the end. I wouldn’t get any proper results, so I’d just give up and let it go half-way in.

I just kept doing that, over and over again. Everyone around me, even my parents, probably thought I was nothing but a spineless kid with no real ambition.

That’s why my parents made me learn karate, to build up my spirit.

And I didn’t really get anywhere with that, either, so I quit it right after.

But at the time, I was able to at least pretend I was working hard by going to the dojo every day.

…Even though I wasn’t gaining anything. I wasn’t growing at all. I was always a white belt…

Even then, I was still able to pretend that I was trying, that I was growing.
{% endbubble %}

{% img /img/es/eventstory/supervillain/supersizedvillainch11_3.jpg %}

{% bubble Tetora frown %}
My parents were relieved to see me try, and praised me a lot for it — Just like Morisawa-senpai does.

“You’re working so hard, Tetora.” “You really *can* do it if you try, Tetora.” “You’re amazing, Tetora.”

……Do you not realize how stupid that is?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki serious %}
………
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora sad3 %}
I’m *not* amazing, not even close. I’m just stuck in the same spot. Everyone would always praise me, but I was the only one who could tell it wasn’t ever true.

I was the only person I couldn’t fool.

I’m hollow inside with only a polished surface, and everyone around me saw that surface and praised me for “doing my best” and for being “a good boy”.

All the while… Deep inside, the real me would stare at my fake self with cold, dead eyes.

Ever since I was a little kid, that feeling has never once left me.
{% endbubble %}

## Chapter 12

{% bubble Tetora smile4 %}
I love my parents and my friends. I was surrounded by nothing but kind, wonderful people.

My parents have always praised me and loved me. To this very day, they both work from morning to night, day in and day out, to earn money for my tuition and living expenses.

Like me, they aren’t very good at what they do, and they don’t seem to make much money, no matter how hard they try.

Even so, they listened to my desires and allowed me to enroll at Yumenosaki. They paid the high entrance fee and provided me with everything I needed.
{% endbubble %}

{% img /img/es/eventstory/supervillain/supersizedvillainch12_1.jpg %}

{% bubble Tetora sad %}
The reason I decided to go to Yumenosaki was because I was passionate about idols at that time.

But, even then… It’s only because, during the time I was half-heartedly trying various things and not accomplishing anything, becoming an idol happened to be what I was aiming for at that moment.

And what made me stick to that goal was because a friend told me something like, “You have good looks, Tetora. Why don’t you become an idol?”

He was just saying something that fit the mood at the time, and I ended up hopping on the thought, as well.

My parents and friends were so supportive that I just couldn’t back out… that’s all there was to it.

I didn’t want to betray the expectations my beloved parents and friends had for me. I didn’t want to damper the mood and have them hate me.
{% endbubble %}

{% img /img/es/eventstory/supervillain/supersizedvillainch12_2.jpg %}

{% bubble Tetora sad3 %}
I really hate myself. So if those around me don’t love me, don’t care for me, then I have no reason to exist.

I despise myself — so if everyone around me gives up on me, I’ll no longer be loved by anyone.

And if nobody loves you… what’s even the point in living?

I was terrified of that happening to me.

To become someone unneeded, unloved, unseen by everyone—

I was already such a hollow person, so close to fading away. I couldn’t stand the thought of that happening for real.

…It’s a common fear for a teenager. But for me, it was a severely serious problem.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori idle %}
Tetora-kun…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora awkward %}
Haha. That’s why I got so angry at you, Midori-kun… It’s like I could see the real me in you — my pathetic self, that I hide in the pit of my stomach.

And yet, I felt like you had everything I ever wanted. You have way better looks than me, and with just a little effort, you could do anything, you know?

I couldn’t help but think it was so unfair.

That, like, if you don’t want it that badly, you should just give me your talent and your beautiful face.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori worried2 %}
Should I say sorry…?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora frown3 %}
No, don’t. If you apologize, I’ll feel even more miserable about myself, and then get unreasonably upset and punch you.

But in reality, the real person I want to punch is myself.

For never being able to grow up — for always being such an uncool person.

To be honest, karate used to be a force of habit for me once upon a time, but the sensei who taught me gave me a bit of his word of wisdom. He told me that learning martial arts is not for the purpose of beating up a loathsome enemy.

He said it’s for personal growth.

It’s a common enough saying that it could’ve come from anyone, but, even then… I intend to aim my well-trained fists inwards, and beat up my weak self.

That way, I could grow, even if only a little.

This wasn’t out of a need to do a noble self-sacrifice, like Morisawa-senpai mentioned. I'm able to cross as many dangerous bridges as I want *because* I hate myself and don’t see myself as anything worthwhile.

Even if I were to get badly hurt and fade away, I wouldn’t regret any of it for even a second. It would’ve felt refreshing, even.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki idle %}
Nagumo…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora smile4 %}
Yeah, don’t worry. I’m no longer desperate enough to put myself through any of that.

I have friends and comrades who love me. I have juniors who admire me and depend on me. I have fans who pay attention to me and want to see more of me.

That’s why… Maybe I was just making the wrong conclusion all along, but… I now believe that even *I’m* worth something.
{% endbubble %}

{% img /img/es/eventstory/supervillain/supersizedvillainch12_3.jpg %}

{% bubble Tetora smile %}
Morisawa-senpai. Shinkai-senpai. Midori-kun. Shinobu-kun.

I love each and every one of you. I respect all of you — you never give up no matter what, and no matter how far down you are, you always crawl back up with all your effort. You’re always shining so brightly.

You, who are all so dazzling like that, recognize me as an equal comrade, that I’ve even started to think I’ve got something of my own inside me—

I can feel that way about myself now, from the bottom of my heart.

Thanks to you guys, I’ve come to like myself a little bit.

But… I want to grow to love myself more and more.

I want to make an actual effort to do so.

When I was all alone, I would just settle with pretending to work hard.

But if everyone lends me their support, I feel like I can succeed for real this time.

That’s why… Please, Ryuseitai — believe in me for just this moment, and entrust your lives to me.

I swear to you — This time around, I won’t make any bit of that go to waste.
