## Chapter 1

<div class="msr-narration">
    <p>Later in the day. In Okinawa, within the forested area, where Crimson Production resides…</p>
</div>

{% bubble Chiaki thinking %}
—Hmm… I knew it, so it really *was* that all along.

It isn’t that Nagumo and Sengoku weren’t getting into contact with us. It wasn’t because of their own personal reasons.

It’s just that they *couldn’t* contact us, even if they wanted to…

It seems like there’s some kind of signal jam around the Crimson Production headquarters.

That’s why no phone calls make it through from inside or near the building.
{% endbubble %}

{% img /img/es/eventstory/supervillain/supersizedvillainch1_2.jpg %}

{% bubble Chiaki frown2 %}
My initial guess was that Nagumo and Sengoku had their phones confiscated and then destroyed, but… It seems like it’s a lot more dangerous than I had originally anticipated.

A signal-jamming generator, of all things… At this point, you may as well tell me we’re in a tokusatsu or sci-fi story. It’s even capable of finding great use as a military weapon.

Speaking of which, Sengoku mentioned that the headquarters building looks like a military facility…

That wasn’t even an exaggeration. His intuition was spot on.

And now that I know that Nagumo and Sengoku have fallen into the pockets of dangerous people, who’re handling such a weapon without a care in the world… This makes me all the more worried.

This is no longer a problem I can solve on my own…

I have to hurry back to Tenshouin and — no, actually, I need to report this to ES as a whole, and ask them to take care of it.

Oh! Before I do that, I should contact my comrades, since they’re working separately from me. I need to let them know what’s going on and have them retreat.

Hmm… Alright, moving this far away from the headquarters building seems to be enough to get a signal. There’s only one bar on my phone, but it’s better than nothing.

Hello, Kanata? Takamine’s with you, right?

Yeah, it looks worse than we expected. I’m planning to get out of here immediately, so you guys pack your bags and get to the airport as soon as possi—
{% endbubble %}

{% img /img/es/eventstory/supervillain/supersizedvillainch1_3.jpg %}

{% bubble Tetora vside %}
—You talk to yourself a lot, “Taichou”.

The cameras aren’t even rolling, you know. Are you in the habit of being unnecessarily cautious because the “audience” won’t understand what you’re thinking unless you say it out loud?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki idle %}
…Nagumo.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora smile %}
Heya, Taichou.

I knew you’d come. I was right to lay down a trap.

It’s only natural you’d show up. There’s no way you’d be so heartless as to leave all the work to me and Sengoku-kun.

If we don’t report, contact, or consult you, you’ll grow anxious and come to check on us yourself, right?

You’ve always been exactly like an overprotective parent.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki smile2 %}
Nagumo… I’m so glad to see you’re doing alright.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora curious %}
Hah?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki v2 %}
At the very least, I’m glad to confirm that you’re safe. How’s Sengoku? He’s not hurt, is he?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora angry2 %}
Do you even *know* what’s going on here?

You’re trespassing on private property. I have the authority to detain and interrogate you.

I’m now in a position similar to an executive staff member of Crimson Production for a number of reasons. I may be a part-time employee, but I’m registered as an official staff member.

And neither ES nor Ryuseitai prohibits us from having side jobs, right?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki smile3 %}
Yeah, of course not. I see, so you got yourself a job. Mhm, that’s something to be happy about.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora frown %}
I’m more like a part-timer. But well, there are many people in the world who want to work, but can’t get a job, so…

I’m grateful enough to have someone hire and pay me, no matter how exploitative the corporation is.

…Ah, but I shouldn’t say anything bad about the company. It’ll affect my assessment. You never know who’s listening.
{% endbubble %}

{% img /img/es/eventstory/supervillain/supersizedvillainch1_4.jpg %}

{% bubble Tetora vside %}
Anyway, I don’t have time to waste on idle chit-chat, so… I’m sorry to say this, but I’m going to have to restrain you.

That’s my job now as an employee in Crimson Production.

Don’t try to resist or escape at all costs.

If you do, I’ll have to hurt you.

I technically do owe you a debt of gratitude for picking me up and raising me. I respect you, and have compassion for you, as we’ve been close comrades for a long time.

That’s why, I’d rather avoid resorting to hurting you.
{% endbubble %}

## Chapter 2

{% bubble Chiaki serious %}
………
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora vside %}
I doubt you noticed, but — as of this moment, Crimson Production’s combatants are lurking in the bushes around here.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki v2 %}
Haha. Combatants, huh? Are we in a tokusatsu?[^1]
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora frown %}
*You’re* the one saying that? That’s just what I call them, really. They’re basically fighters who’re willing to do the dirty work of spilling blood.

In tokusatsu shows, combatants are small fry that can be KO’d with a single punch — but I assume you at least know that in a real life situation, you should never go against them, right?

They have no resistance to violence. If anything, they train day and night just to hone their physical strength.

I’m sure you’re aware that an ordinary person like you, without any superpowers, can’t win against them in a fight.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki smile3 %}
Well, I’m not much of a fighter to begin with, so I wouldn’t really be able to win in a fistfight if I were up against an adult.

I did have the basics of self-defense drilled into me by Kiryu in our Circle, though.

He does teach me a bit of martial arts that are more for playing pretend, but…

When it comes to actual real life situations, all he ever tells me is, “If you ever encounter an assaulter, you should yell for help or run away immediately.”
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora idle %}
Did he ever also tell you, “If they’re armed, you should surrender without any question and hand over whatever they want without provoking them.” — hm?

Because that’s exactly the position you’re in right now, Taichou.

You aren’t strong enough to oppose our attacks. You have no choice but to stay put and obey our command.

The situation is overwhelmingly in our favor. I’d rather not waste energy grappling with you, so I’d much appreciate it if you’d do as I say and let us take you in quietly.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki serious %}
…And if I don’t comply?
{% endbubble %}

{% img /img/es/eventstory/supervillain/supersizedvillainch2_1.jpg %}

{% bubble Tetora angry2 %}
…? Were you always *this* stupid…?

If you don’t, this is what’s gonna happen.
{% endbubble %}

<div class="msr-narration">
    <p><em>(Sound of a punch)</em></p>
</div>

{% bubble Chiaki shocked %}
—…!
{% endbubble %}

{% img /img/es/eventstory/supervillain/chiakiorigcg.jpg %}

{% bubble Chiaki svocg %}
… … ………
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora smile3 %}
Haha. Taken aback, are you, Taichou? I’m sure you’ve experienced a lot of flashy battles in tokusatsu, but is this seriously the very first time you’ve *actually* been punched or something?

Or, what? Did you really think I wouldn’t actually hit you?
{% endbubble %}

{% img /img/es/eventstory/supervillain/supersizedvillainch2_2.jpg %}

{% bubble Tetora angry2 %}
Either way, you’re always *so* naive!

You need to wake up already! You should at least know the difference between reality and fantasy!

We aren’t in a tokusatsu show here!

I’m so *sick* and tired of being subjected to your hobbies!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki sad3 %}
Nagumo… Guh— <th><em>(cough, cough)</em></th>…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora smile2 %}
Ahh, sorry. I punched you in the chest — are you in pain from a bruised lung?

If you stop being able to breathe properly, you won’t be able to get oxygen to your body, making it harder to move. You won’t even be able to call for help because you’re in too much pain to scream. Efficient, isn’t it?

If you still choose to resist, then I’ll have no choice but to strangle you until you lose consciousness.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki sigh2 %}
…I only have one thing to say, Nagumo.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora smile %}
Whoa, you can still talk, huh? You’ve got guts, I’ll give you that. I didn’t hold back at all with that punch.

So? What is it? Is it time to hear the sore loser say his last words?

Or are you going to lecture me now? “Stop with all these cruel acts! You’re supposed to be a good boy!”
{% endbubble %}

{% img /img/es/eventstory/supervillain/supersizedvillainch2_3.jpg %}

{% bubble Tetora smile %}
Hahaha. That would be *so* funny.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki idle %}
No, even *I’m* aware that it’s pointless to give you a wholehearted lecture.

Now that you’ve been tainted with evil.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora idle %}
………
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki serious %}
But, yes, I’d like to be a “sore loser,” as you put it.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora smile %}
Fine by me. I can’t wait to see the sort of cursing you, a good little boy, can come up with.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki frown %}
I’m sorry, Nagumo.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora curious %}
…? Why are you apologizing?

Haha. We've had this same exchange before, haven’t we?

But unlike how it was then, this time around was no accident. I hit you with full ill-intent.

Though, I was still a hero back then, and right now, I’m a villain to the very core.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki smile2 %}
Yeah, you surprisingly suit that role as well, Nagumo.

I may have been destroying your potential for the sake of my dreams all this time.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora frown %}
*That’s* what you want to apologize for? You didn’t drag me in by the collar, nor force me to do anything. I chose this path on my own, m’kay?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki idle %}
But you didn’t like being here originally, right? Back when you first joined Ryuseitai.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora idle %}
Yeah, but all those feelings disappeared half-way. I did everything because I enjoyed it.

I even thought that the heroes you admired matched the ideal that I should aspire to be.

The ideal man among men, that I’ve been striving to become since I was a little kid.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki smile2 %}
Ah, I see. How about now?

Is there still a hero at the end of the path you’re walking?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora sad %}
I don’t know. …I’m not sure anymore.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki smile3 %}
—Excuse me for changing the subject, but… I used to get bullied often in the past.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora curious %}
……?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki frown %}
I’ve never told you guys much about it because I was so ashamed, but—

Ryuseitai used to be a horrible unit back then.[^2]
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora idle %}
Even compared to the present Ryuseitai, at its current abysmal state?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki serious %}
Yeah, even compared to that. No one took their activities or lessons seriously, and yet they would always put on airs by misusing the reputation of being in “Yumenosaki’s oldest idol unit”.

They gained profits and fame just by leeching off of that reputation. That was how the Ryuseitai members of the past would continuously play around and squander what they had gained.

They indulged in their pleasures without ever bothering to do anything troublesome or difficult.

It’s ridiculous to study, take lessons, and work wholeheartedly. It’s foolish and wrong to spend your precious youth, that you can only experience once, on tiring tasks.

It’s right to laugh and behave foolishly, throw away irritating obligations, skip classes, and play around all day.

That was the form of justice that Ryuseitai believed in, once upon a time.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora idle %}
………
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki frown %}
I was the villain who defied the justice of that Ryuseitai.

I just couldn’t read the room… I kept calling over everyone who was unwilling to do their best and kept trying to tell them to straighten up… so they saw me as an absolute pain.

That’s how I became the target of bullying. Whenever I came face to face with everyone in Ryuseitai, who were supposed to be my comrades, they would only poke fun and laugh at me.

I became someone against justice, who deserved to be kicked and cursed at — in other words, an evil monster.
{% endbubble %}

{% img /img/es/eventstory/supervillain/supersizedvillainch2_4.jpg %}

{% bubble Chiaki sad %}
That was why I was forced to do all their tedious jobs and homework, day in and day out.

Among many things they forced me to do, one of them was cleaning the pool in the middle of the night, all on my own.

It was agonizing… It was hell itself.

Of course, there are a lot of people in the world who are much worse off than I was.

There were even people like that in the very same school. I may have been bullied, but it was nothing compared to what the Five Eccentrics were subjected to.

That’s why I couldn’t complain to anyone. I just couldn't let myself whine — about how hard it was, about how much I couldn’t stand it anymore — as if I was some sort of wuss.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora idle %}
………
{% endbubble %}

## Chapter 3

{% bubble Chiaki serious %}
That’s why I tried to get through the days by always pretending to be an idiot who didn’t think or feel anything. I just smiled and laughed, convincing myself that I was happy.
{% endbubble %}

{% img /img/es/eventstory/supervillain/supersizedvillainch3_1.jpg %}

{% bubble Chiaki smile2 %}
And then, on that starry night — I met Kanata, who had lived a much more pitiful life than I, and had never been treated as a human being—

That mask of mine, of a crudely drawn smile, was completely smashed to pieces by Kiryu and Akehoshi—

And like a miracle, I “transformed” into the hero I had always yearned to be, even if only for a mere moment.

And with the help of the kind-hearted villains, Akatsuki, who went along with my farce… I was able to build up the Ryuseitai of today.

The Ryuseitai that I dreamed of.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora frown %}
…What the hell have you been on about?

Do you think I’m going to take pity and go easy on you just because you revealed your shameful past?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki smile3 %}
Yeah, I wonder why I’m saying all of this… Mhm, you’re right, this has nothing to do with anything.

But it’s something I should have told you before, and it felt like the opportunity to mention it presented itself.

In fact, I apologize for taking so long to tell you. I’m sorry.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora idle %}
Mm… It’s very different from what I’ve heard from Shinkai-senpai. From his point of view, Taichou was a super cool hero from the beginning to the end.

I had no idea about how you were “before transformation”.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki sad %}
The reason he never told you about it is likely all my fault.

Ryuseitai is indeed the oldest idol unit in Yumenosaki Academy. It’s a veteran powerhouse with history and tradition.

But the ideal Ryuseitai that everyone loves and the agency wants is something that I forcibly created in my generation.

A dream that a bullied, cowardly tokusatsu nerd dreamed of, that just so happened to become a reality.

But a dream is nothing but a dream. You have to wake up someday.

No, in fact… I should have properly ended my dream when I had passed the leadership position to you.

I should have given my story a proper ending and handed over my place to the next lead star, the hero of the new era.

Just like the tokusatsu heroes I love so much.

That’s why, I’m so sorry, Nagumo. This whole year’s messy development is all my fault — It’s all because I never properly settled these things.
{% endbubble %}

{% img /img/es/eventstory/supervillain/supersizedvillainch3_2.jpg %}

{% bubble Tetora sad %}
Why the hell do you keep apologizing!? It pisses me off!

“What went wrong?” “Why have we turned out this way?”

We’ve gone through this so many times by now, over and over and *over* again.

Yet… we never managed to come to a conclusion. There’s no point in dredging up the past. Maybe we could at least brace ourselves to avoid repeating the same mistakes, but…

It’s unproductive, and in reality, just pointless. No amount of regret will change our situation.

That’s why I—

……!?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki idle %}
What’s wrong, Nagumo? Is there trouble?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora surprised %}
A messenger is here… He says there are trespassers breaking into the headquarters building of Crimson Production as we speak.

Hold on… No, don’t tell me the reason you’ve been blabbering on endlessly was to—
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki smile3 %}
Mhm, I wanted to apologize for that too. Sorry, sorry.

I’ve said this many times already, but I used to be a victim of bullying. That’s why I’m pretty sensitive when it comes to malicious intent.

We live in a world in which the weak are meat; the strong do eat. Weak meat like me had to be extremely vigilant to avoid being eaten. I wouldn’t have survived otherwise.

That’s why I was already aware that you were approaching and surrounding me, even before you spoke to me.

I intentionally spoke aloud for that reason, and lied to you as if Kanata and Takamine were on standby somewhere else.

I was intentionally misinforming you guys.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora angry2 %}
Ugh, I was wondering why you were all alone when you’re such a pushover—

—This guy’s a decoy! There are other guys from Ryuseitai breaking in! Don’t let them get away! Capture them all!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki smile3 %}
Fuhaha! It’s too late to panic now.

There’s no signal in this area. None of you can use your phones either, so the only way to communicate is to send a messenger.

Your colleagues over in the headquarters building won’t be able to respond fast enough to the crisis.

And I’m sure that, now that Kanata and Takamine broke into the building, they’ve already made contact with Sengoku and rescued him from his confinement.

I don’t know what sort of situation Sengoku is in right now, but he is the only one who would *never* betray Ryuseitai. Even now, he’s bound to be on our side.

They’ll have joined forces with Sengoku, and since he’s good at gathering information, they’ll continue to investigate the building.

Since it’s your headquarters, that means that there’s a possibility of finding information that could destroy your footing, such as evidence of illegal acts.

If we can secure it and escape safely, it’ll be our victory.

Crimson Production would collapse and go bankrupt. And you, as an employee of this corporation, would be able to wash your hands from all the evil.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora angry2 %}
…And here I thought you were nothing but an idiot…

So what? Sure, we’ve taken your bait, and now security at the headquarters is a little thin. And sure, maybe you’ll be able to at least get in touch with Sengoku-kun, or search the building.

But that doesn't change your situation.

You’re surrounded by a group of people who aren’t afraid to use violence, and you’ve clearly provoked them — by declaring war.

Are you a dumbass, or what? Did you not consider we could just kill you for making us snap? Just how much of a pacifistic idiot are you?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki smile3 %}
Don’t look down on your older brother so much, Nagumo.

Our generation has survived the Yumenosaki War Era, days that you’ve never experienced. A war that was fought, full of deceit.

“Pacifistic idiot”? Just *who* do you think you’re speaking to, junior?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora angry %}
………
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki smile2 %}
I wouldn’t ever barge into a dangerous place like this without any precautions or preparation in the first place.

Regardless, even if I *do* get killed or otherwise disappear, Tenshouin will make his move. I made sure those arrangements were set in place before we left.

Tenshouin is someone I can ask for that sort of favor, because he’s my friend.

And if the supreme Tenshouin Zaibatsu comes into play here, the fate of Crimson Production would soon be in dire state.

*That’s* when you’ll truly be doomed. They’ll absolutely investigate all of you thoroughly, count up all your sins, and crush you.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora angry %}
………
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki smile2 %}
I’ll say it a hundred times more. This time, it’s my victory — *our* victory, Nagumo.

Your biggest mistake was to choose the path of evil. And typically, this isn’t something said to the loser, but—

I choose to deliberately tell you, my immature and foolish junior, my favorite phrase:

—Justice will always prevail.
{% endbubble %}

## Chapter 4

{% img /img/es/eventstory/supervillain/supersizedvillainch4_1.jpg %}

<div class="msr-narration">
    <p>Nearly an hour later. Inside Crimson Production’s agency office…</p>
</div>

{% bubble Midori sigh %}
I’m so sorry, Morisawa-senpai.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata sigh2 %}
our plan was a [complete failure].
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shinobu sigh %}
We were all captured easily…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki surprised %}
You guys…!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora grin %}
Ahahahahaha!!

Hey, Taichou, what were you just telling me oh-so-proudly earlier? “It’s our victory”? “Justice will always prevail”?

So I wouldn’t be wrong to assume that this means that Crimson Production is on the side of justice, would I?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki frown2 %}
Guhhh… This is so frustrating. There’s nothing I can even say to counter that…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori smile2 %}
Just seeing Morisawa-senpai this frustrated brings me joy somehow.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki surprised %}
W-Why, Takamine!? Why are you happy!? I don’t recall ever raising you to be such a mean-spirited boy, who would laugh at other people’s demise!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori v2 %}
I don’t recall being raised by you, either.

But I mean, who wouldn’t laugh at this situation?

—Hey, um, so… I don’t really get what’s going on here, but how much of this was an act, in the end…?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora vside %}
………
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shinobu v2 %}
It is all right, Tetora-kun. I have been locked up here ever since I was captured—

But because you tied me up so loosely, I was able to discreetly free myself by utilizing Ninpou: Rope-removal Jutsu.

I took advantage of any opportunity that I wasn’t being watched to thoroughly observe the office. I investigated all the positions and angles of the surveillance cameras, as well as sound recording devices, until I had a perfect grasp of their effect range.

As long as we speak quietly in the corner of this room, there is no possibility that anyone else can hear what we are saying.

However, since the surveillance cameras will catch a glimpse of us, it would be better for you to continue looking like a scary villain, if possible.

You will need to maintain a villainous demeanor in your posture and manner of speaking, as well.

After all, while you may have been able to clear the area by telling everyone that you’ll be the one to interrogate us, we do not know when the Crimson Production staff will come back.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora smile %}
Okay. I’ve gotten used to speaking in this tone now, anyway. I used to talk like this when I was young, and it’s starting to come back to me.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori smile %}
Ahh, I didn’t know you used to talk normally when you were young. Makes sense, though.

Yeah, I was trained thoroughly to speak that way when I started learning karate, or well, it’s just that it became so natural to start saying “Ossu” and the like.

In Shinkai-senpai’s case, it feels as though he may have been this way for a long time — but “Shinobu-kun” didn’t always speak like a ninja either, did he?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shinobu v2 %}
Mhm… Ehehe, Tetora-kun with a normal tone of voice has a slightly different and dangerous charm to it. I think it’s lovely!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori worried %}
Ehh~… I dunno what it is, but I don’t really vibe with this Tetora-kun… He’s got that shallow energy of someone who I’d never be able to understand, and neither would he to me.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora frown %}
I mean, if we weren’t in the same unit, I doubt we’d have ever spoken to each other in the first place, you feel me?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori smile3 %}
Yeah, I know what you mean… Fate’s really a strange thing, isn’t it?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata curious %}
…um. i do not think i fully [understand].

so, in the end, what does this mean?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora smile %}
That’s a pretty vague question, huh? But I know what you’re trying to ask.

To put it very briefly: I’m basically an undercover agent sent by ES.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shinobu v2 %}
He’s a ninja, a ninja! ♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora idle %}
Well, more specifically, I’m a spy. Now that ES is dead-set on a nationwide domination, there has naturally been an emergence of resistance groups throughout the country since SS — the “anti-ES organizations,” so to speak. ES finds them to be an eyesore.

They consider them a hindrance, like this agency we have here, Crimson Production.

That’s why they’re trying to destroy them. Preferably by exposing their corruption and criticizing their acts in front of the public, by fair means.

So when Anti-Stars, my juniors from the former Ryuseitai, asked for my help, I was selected as the person in charge.

And then I was dispatched to Okinawa, under the guise of consulting with Anti-Stars, since they had been incorporated into Crimson Production.

That was the sort of pretext I was working under.

In other words, that’s just the surface. Behind the scenes, though, I was actually asked by ES to spy on Crimson Production, an anti-ES organization.
