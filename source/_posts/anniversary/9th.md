{% bubble Chiaki smile %}
So about the new song we'll perform at the anniversary live; the lyrics are just *superb!* Look, especially the…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora norsmile %}
“Believe it to be your courage” part, right? You've talked 'bout it a few times, so I already know by now.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shinobu curious %}
Huh? Is it not the “the more passionate we become” part? I also heard Morisawa-dono talk about the lyrics before, so~…?
{% endbubble %}

<div class="minitalk" character="Anzu">
    <div class="minitalk-option">
        <div class="minitalk-option_header">
            Which is it?
        </div>
        <div class="minitalk-option_content">
        {% bubble Kanata norsmile %}
        i heard him mention a different part of the [lyrics] from the two of you, actually~ chiaki has so many parts he [loves], doesn't he?
        {% endbubble %}
        {% bubble Midori serious %}
        I'd prefer it if he could at least be consistent with what he tells everyone, though… By the way, I actually heard Tetora-kun's thoughts on the lyrics.
        {% endbubble %}
        {% bubble Shinobu smileconfident %}
        Mmh! I haven't heard his thoughts yet~ I'd love to know the parts Tetora-kun loves, too~♪
        {% endbubble %}
        {% bubble Tetora smileexplain %}
        Then how 'bout we all talk 'bout the song together before our practice session? We could share our thoughts and deepen our understanding of the song~♪
        {% endbubble %}

    </div>
    <div class="minitalk-option">
        <div class="minitalk-option_header">

        <div class="minitalk-option_content">
        {% bubble Midori curious %}
        “It just means you like it that much”? Well, if you look at it in a positive light, then I guess so… But isn't it just him being indecisive about it…?
        {% endbubble %}
        {% bubble Chiaki frustrated %}
        Guh…! I honestly just can't decide on one! I love every single part, after all!
        {% endbubble %}
        {% bubble Tetora smilesoft %}
        Well, I get how you feel. I also love everythin' about the song, from the melody to the lyrics.
        {% endbubble %}
        {% bubble Kanata grin %}
