        …It's a pretty large-scale set-up, so we should manage to surprise the audience? That's true…

        {% bubble Kanata v2 %}
        i hope we can make them happy with lots of [fanservice]~♪

        {% bubble Midori frown %}
        <em>Sigh</em>… That all the more means we have even more attention on us, so we can't mess it up. I'm nervous…
        {% endbubble %}
        {% bubble Shinobu v2 %}
        It is crucial that we enjoy this as ourselves, in the way that suits us best! Let's make sure to make the place exciting on the day of the event, as well!

{% bubble Tetora curious %}
Hm? What didja find?

Erm… "Linking ♡s Game"?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shinobu v2 %}
It seems that you pass the round every time you make the same pose as the idol. It sounds fun!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata v2 %}
we all have our own personal hero [poses], so we can definitely [link] with each other~
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori worried0 %}
Um, but then we wouldn't really play by the game's rules, would we…? It's not that sorta game, right…?
