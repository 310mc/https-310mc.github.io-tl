…Alright, I didn't forget to deliver anything here. Thank you for purchasing~… Wait, there isn't even anyone here…

							I was just finishing up my veggie deliveries from my family's greengrocer. What about you, Anzu-san? Are you working right now?

							Huh, so you've got a meeting to prepare for. That sounds rough to deal with early in the morning…

							Good morni—Oh, it's you, Anzu-san.

							It's too early to eat here, y'know…? I doubt there's anything prepared right now.

							But I guess you could at least have a coffee here or something, yeah. The tables are big enough for sorting through documents, too.

							As you can probably tell, I've been going around ES delivering veggies. It takes so long to get through 'cause of how huge the load is…

							"You're doing a great job"…? I could say the same thing to you, though…? It's incredible that you're here so early in the morning…

{% bubble Midori curious %}
Huh…? You're wondering why I keep sighing over and over again…?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori sightired %}
Uuu… I'm sorry, it must've been so annoying… But I feel like I can't get through the day without sighing a little…

You probably already know this, but Ryuseitai hasn't been doing well lately…

							Yeah, exactly. I keep finding myself complaining about how depressing it is…

							That side of me just frustrates me even *more*… But I can't hold in the urge to complain whenever I get fed up of something…

							So I've been at least trying to avoid making any depressing comments whenever I'm around strangers…

			<div data-tab="1a-r" style="display: none">
            	{% bubble Midori yare %}
							The three of us in Ryuseitai are on hiatus right now… and now that I've got nothing to do, I end up overthinking stuff and getting even more depressed…

							I've been trying to at least do *some* kinda physical activity to avoid that, so that's why I've been putting way more effort into my family's greengrocer than I used to.

							Ah, wait a sec—Maybe another reason I've been sighing so much is 'cause I've been carrying a lot of veggies…?

							I knew it. Well, of course you would, since you're the producer…

							We were just about to suck it up and do the whole restructuring of the unit when our seniors suddenly decided they'd leave the unit… So things got even more complicated…

							They're always *so* random with their decisions. I wish they'd understand that you *need* to explain yourself first before deciding on something.
				{% endbubble %}

			<div data-tab="1b-r" style="display: none">
            	{% bubble Midori sighfrown %}
							Mmm… Personally, I don't feel that affected by the whole restructuring thing the agency suggested…

							Meanwhile, both Tetora-kun and Shinobu-kun were doing their best to accept the reality of the situation, but… our seniors made everything worse, you could say…

							Thanks to that, Tetora-kun seems on edge, and our seniors haven't explained themselves yet either, as always. *Sigh*, this is so depressing…

{% bubble Midori norsmile %}
Thanks for lending an ear, Anzu-san…

Talking to you made me realize that maybe I really *did* want someone to hear me out all along…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori sighfrown %}
I didn't think I needed it at first, 'cause I don't want too many people knowing what's been going on with us, and I barely have anyone I can talk to when it comes to unit problems…

							Ummm, no, it's okay… I feel too awkward to do that…

							I'd feel awful if I put more work on somebody who's already so busy…

							Aren't you the one who could use a lending hand? I could help you out with stuff if it requires manual labor, so please feel free to ask me anytime.

							Here, please take some vegetables as repayment for hearing me out. It's my way of showing support, so… Please take care with your work.

							Don't worry, these aren't for delivery. Hmm, mini tomatoes should be a nice snack when you're on the clock…

							"How about talking to a friend"…? F-Friend…?

							The first people that came to mind are Tetora-kun and Shinobu-kun, but that'd just be a discussion between Ryuseitai members…

							I guess Hinata-kun could be another option…? But I might end up bothering him if I suddenly came to him with a problem…

							There's no way I could talk about my worries to the people who literally act as the vice-president of their agencies…

							Ah, but dorming with my roommates is pretty normal for the most part… They gift me souvenirs whenever they travel around the country, and check over my school work, and stuff…
