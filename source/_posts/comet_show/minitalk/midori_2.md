							Eh, nothing much… I was just thinking about how I can't seem to keep up with things lately…

							I was looking through social media just now, and people are already talking about upcoming shows for winter and spring… When it's not even October yet…

							I get so depressed whenever I come across stuff like that… But I guess it's my own fault for looking up stuff on social media in the first place…

							That's why I'm glad you pointed it out to me right now, Anzu-san. After all, I shouldn't have a scary look on my face when I'm supposed to be a hero, right?

What am I doing? …Not much. I've got nothing to do right now…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori frown %}
Ryuseitai's on a hiatus, so I was planning to laze around at home after classes were over, but my parents kicked me out…

I'd only stand out if I stuck around the shopping district, though, so… That's how I ended up here.

							I don't have any. I feel too awkward practicing all alone in an ES practice room…

							Also, there'd be no point to it, anyway. I wouldn't be able to tell how well I'm doing with my choreography on my own…

…Ah, please check this out. This soft drink ad just showed up on my social media feed.

{% bubble Midori srsthinking %}
It's showing Morisawa-senpai in full… Oh, he's gotten a lot of comments from his fans, too.

Let's see… "I'm wishing you the best, Chiaki-kun"… "I love you, Chiaki-kun!"… Man, he sure is popular…
