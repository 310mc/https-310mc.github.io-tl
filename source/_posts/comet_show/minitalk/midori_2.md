(Let's search for… "Morisawa, Chiaki"…)

(Huh, there really *are* a lot of people talking about his casting role in the new tokusatsu show… Where the heck did they get this info from, anyway…?)

…Huh, Anzu-san? Good afternoon…

							Eh, nothing much… I was just thinking about how I can't seem to keep up with things lately…

							I was looking through social media just now, and people are already talking about upcoming shows for winter and spring… When it's not even October yet…

							I get so depressed whenever I come across stuff like that… But I guess it's my own fault for looking up stuff on social media in the first place…

							Huh? Nothing much… I was just searching up topics related to Morisawa-senpai on social media…

							I'd *hate* to find out that he's been talking behind our backs, so I regularly search his name as a check-up.

							…Why're you asking me if I'm okay…? What's so strange about looking up stuff about your senior online…?

							Oh, you should blame Morisawa-senpai for that. I was just searching up his name on social media…

							I tend to search his name every once in a while, but I've been doing it way more often lately 'cause I'm frustrated that he's barely concerned about us nowadays…

							Thanks to that, I have all his talk shows memorized in my head… Ugh, this sucks, I'm not even a fan of him or anything…

							Huh? Did I…?

							Tetora-kun's told me before that I look scary when I'm serious, but I can't exactly tell on my own…

							That's why I'm glad you pointed it out to me right now, Anzu-san. After all, I shouldn't have a scary look on my face when I'm supposed to be a hero, right?

What am I doing? …Not much. I've got nothing to do right now…

Ryuseitai's on a hiatus, so I was planning to laze around at home after classes were over, but my parents kicked me out…

I'd only stand out if I stuck around the shopping district, though, so… That's how I ended up here.

							I don't have any. I feel too awkward practicing all alone in an ES practice room…

							Also, there'd be no point to it, anyway. I wouldn't be able to tell how well I'm doing with my choreography on my own…

							Our formation and how we present ourselves together is really important, y'know… I wouldn't be able to tell if I'm doing that properly or not at all…

							I don't really have any. The only thing I could do now is solo practice, I think…?

							I don't have any personal training like Tetora-kun and Shinobu-kun, either. Wait, woops—Almost forgot about Basketball Club…

							Isara-senpai's been telling me to show up whenever I can, so maybe I'll consider going tomorrow…

							I do get jobs related to my greengrocer background…

							But I can't have people think of me as the greengrocer boy over being an idol or hero, so I only do it every once in a while…

							My parents are super happy about it, though, so lately I've been trying to think of it as a way to repay them for everything.

							Well, I guess I *do* have some, yeah… But I don't do my modeling work as often as I used to…

							I don't have any photoshoots to deal with for the weekend anymore, so I've just been casually enjoying my weekends lately…

							And Ryuseitai's on hiatus too, so I guess I also get to chill on weekdays…

…Ah, please check this out. This soft drink ad just showed up on my social media.

It's showing Morisawa-senpai in full… Oh, he's gotten a lot of comments from his fans, too.

Let's see… "I'm wishing you the best, Chiaki-kun"… "I love you, Chiaki-kun!"… Man, he sure is popular…

							Ohhh, you're the one who suggested this to him?

							I mean, I *guess* it does suit his image and all, but… since I know what he's *actually* like, I can't help but feel like everyone's being tricked…

							We're talking about a guy who literally yells *"Okaa-saaaaaaaan!!!"* to the ocean, y'know…?

							Point? …Ah, does that mean you're the one who suggested this ad to him?

							Huh, it does kinda suit his image. I guess he does look like a pleasant person when he smiles—as long as he keeps his mouth shut, that is.

							If only he always looked this calm in real life, and maybe then I'd finally be able to live my life peacefully…

							No, not really… It's just… He feels so far away…

							He was always pestering me day in and out last year… So why is it so hard *just* to meet up with him now…? It makes no sense to me…

							I should give him an earful or two the next time we meet, don't you think? Yeah, that sounds like a good idea…

							I know there's no point in me getting angry at an ad, but I'm kinda upset, like… "What the hell are you smiling over when your unit's suffering right now"…

							He's supposed to be the number one person who wants to become a hero, but instead he asks to *leave* the unit? Does he ever bother to think about how *we* feel?

							If you're *such* a hero of justice and all, then how about you consider protecting your own comrades' feelings, huh…
