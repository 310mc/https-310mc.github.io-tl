<div class="msr-narration">
    <p>A few days later. Within the SANCTUARY Amusement Park, during the “Parallel World” special project…</p>
</div>

{% bubble Rchiaki grin %}
“Fuhahahaha! An amusement park means only one thing: it’s time for a hero show!”
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Rmidori grinconfident %}
“The white fur is the mark of justice! The pure light, untainted by evil…!”
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Rshinobu smileconfident %}
“With our cute round eyes and our long ears—! We will eradicate any and all evil!”
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Rtetora fist %}
“We are—! The Lovely☆Cute Allies of Justice: Ra*bits!”
{% endbubble %}

{% img /img/es/eventstory/parallelworld/2.jpg %}

{% bubble Hajime smile %}
W-Wooow~…! Clap, clap, clap ♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mitsuru grin %}
Woaah, you guys look super duper cool~!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Hajime awkward %}
Mm~… I know we already watched a video of this performance beforehand, but seeing it in real life really <em>does</em> feel strange— Ah, actually! I feel more like I’m in a dream somehow.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Nazuna grin %}
Pfft—S-Sorr—…Ahahahaha~! ☆ I dunno, I think I like it! It’s just so *funny!* The way you guys even thought up <em>catchphrases</em>…!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Rchiaki nod %}
“Whew! I’m so glad to know you like it, Nito!”
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Nazuna frown %}
Don’t call me “Nito” with Tomo-chin’s face~ You can’t break character; you guys are supposed to be Ra*bits now, m’kay?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Rmidori frown %}
“Yeah… That’s super important. It’s the same with mascots; if it feels like there’s a human being inside the costume, it spoils the whole fun for everyone…”
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Rtetora fist %}
“Ossu! We’re gonna do our absolute best with our performance, while abidin’ by your character!”
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Rshinobu smile %}
“Nihihi, we were just in the middle of considering what to do from now on as Ryuseitai…”

“So we are also grateful to take part in this project, as it provides us an opportunity to test our potential in various ways!”
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Rchiaki nod %}
“Yeah! That being said, while we may personally be accustomed to doing these heroic acts—”

“When a more orthodox idol unit like Ra*bits do hero-like moves, it feels extremely out of place, doesn’t it?”
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Rtetora smile2 %}
“That’s ‘cuz in the first place, we Ryuseitai forcibly combined two separate styles with each other.”

“To be honest, idols and heroes <em>seem</em> compatible, but they’re sorta a bad combo.”
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Rmidori glare %}
“Beep, beep, this is the Mascot Character Police. We are currently Ra*bits, so I believe calling ourselves by the unit name ‘Ryusei-whatever’ is an issue.”
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Rtetora yare %}
“Aren’t <em>you</em> also talking in a not-so-Hajime-kun way with his face, Midori-kun?”[^1]
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Rmidori sad2 %}
“Yeah… I’m sorry, Shino-kun… Of all people, it ended up being <em>me</em> acting as you…”
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Hajime %}
Huh? But I’m really happy that it’s you who’s portraying me, Takamine-kun! I’m honored!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Rmidori grinsoft %}
“I’m also pretty happy, actually… Fufufu, right now, I’m cute in every single way…♪”

“I don’t have to feel fed up with myself whenever I look at the mirror and get reminded how huge I am…♪”
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Hajime awkward %}
I-I’m not <em>that</em> short, though…?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Rmidori northinking %}
“Huh, yet you always give the impression that you’re tiny and cute… How come…?”
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Hajime smile %}
Ah, that’s because I always make sure to have my photos taken at the right angles.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Rchiaki nod %}
“Mhm! This is all very intriguing, and it’s great to see you guys getting along, but we’re in the middle of work! I’d like you to stop your chatter here!”
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Nazuna %}
Ooh~… Chiaki-chin, it seemed like you’d been taking the backseat in Ryuseitai for a long while, but… Looks like you’re leading the unit now, like you used to.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Rchiaki grin %}
“That’s because I’m the commander[^2] this time!”
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Nazuna curious %}
What do you mean by “this time”~?

Well, I’m sure that just means that a lot has happened to you guys, too.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Rchiaki serious %}
“Yeah, and for you all, as well. All the strange ruckus going about is pretty worrisome; are you truly alright?”
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Rchiaki fist %}
“If there’s anything else we can help you with, you’re completely free to rely on us!”
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Nazuna smile2 %}
You’re helping us out a bunch already. Right, Tomo-chin?
{% endbubble %}

{% img /img/es/eventstory/parallelworld/3.jpg %}

{% bubble Tomoya smile %}
Yes. We’re sorry to ask more from your time, but we would love it if you could keep acting as a parallel version of us.

That’s the main point of the “Parallel World” project.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Rchiaki %}
“‘Parallel World’… In the Heronese language, that’d be like a multiverse, huh?”

“Which means there are parallel versions of Ra\*bits that went down a different path from the Ra\*bits we know.”

“As for us in Ryuseitai, we’re acting as Ra\*bits in the ‘what if Ra\*bits was a hero sentai squad?’ alternative universe.”

“I see that you’ve stationed all sorts of bizarre versions of Ra*bits around the park to make them sing and dance, but… What’s the reason behind all of it?”
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tomoya smile %}
You’ll know shortly. We’ll have the official announcement out about everything soon.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Rchiaki fist %}
“Alright! I don’t fully get it, but I’ll wait to see everything unfold with anticipation!”

“You’ve got this, Mashiro Tomoya! You guys were the most strong-willed unit in all of Yumenosaki! I’m sure you can overcome any and all hardships, no matter what they may be!”
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tomoya smile %}
Ahaha, getting a pep talk from someone with the same face as me feels weird — It’s like I’m talking to myself through the mirror.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Hajime curious %}
It really feels as though we’re in a different dimension, doesn’t it…? There are so many people with the same face as us walking around.

There’s probably a much more outstanding version of me out there. I’m sure we wouldn’t even have to go looking for one; he’s probably around here already.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tomoya smile2 %}
No matter how outstanding or talented he is, he’d never be able to replace you, Hajime.

The one and only Shino Hajime of Ra*bits that we love is *you.*
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Rmidori blushshy %}
“Mashiro-kun… Sorry, but you’re gonna make me blush if you stare at me so closely.”
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Hajime scold %}
You liar, Tomoya-kun! It took you mere <em>seconds</em> to confuse me for someone else! So much for that love! You wouldn’t have made that mistake if you truly loved me…!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tomoya surprised %}
S-S-S-Sorry…! But they really do look exactly like us, seriously!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mitsuru %}
Yeah! Technology is amazing~ SSVRS is crazy good!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Nazuna %}
It sure is~ It feels just like magic to me at this point. Like special contact lenses you can wear to see a whole new world or something.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Hajime %}
Yes, to both us and the visitors, all the other idols look exactly like us.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tomoya %}
That’s the plan, after all. This sorta technology is the norm in the SANCTUARY.[^3] Visitors are under that sort of “mechanical spell”.

Everyone is dreaming while still being in reality.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Hajime smile %}
While watching all the parallel versions of us, right?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Nazuna sigh2 %}
I’m pretty satisfied with our plan, and I do think it’s interesting, but… Ughh\~ It’s making me feel dizzy somehow… I feel like I’m gonna go crazy\~…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Hajime %}
You’re extremely sensitive after all, aren’t you, Nii~chan?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Nazuna awkward %}
It’s more like I just can’t beat the flexibility that a youngster has, no matter what…
{% endbubble %}

{% img /img/es/eventstory/parallelworld/4.jpg %}

{% bubble Rkanata %}
“with the [five of us] together, we are [rabbits]…☆”
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Rchiaki shocked %}
“Ah—! Kanata, no! You lost in rock-paper-scissors and ended up with the role of the monster villain[^4], remember!? Ra*bits is a group of four, so we can’t be ‘the five of us’!”
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Rkanata %}
“but i’m so lonely\~! i feel like i am the only one [left out] and it is so lonely\~!”
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Rmidori worried %}
“O-Oh no, poor Shinkai-senpai… Technically, while three-man and five-man hero squads do exist, four-man groups are pretty rare, so it <em>does</em> feel a bit out of place.”

“We should let Shinkai-senpai in—”
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Rkanata %}
“midori! you are a good boy! because you were so kind to me, i will give you [wakame seaweed] to show my [gratitude]~♪”
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Rshinobu grin %}
“Ahaha, why does this sound like the start of a new folktale?”
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Rtetora norsmile2 %}
“Yeah, it’s the monster repaying the kind favor.”
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Rchiaki nod %}
“Do you mean Metalder!? Is this like another episodic story from Superhuman-Machine Metalder!?”[^5]
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Rmidori frown %}
“<em>Ughh,</em> so annoying… I hate that this guy’s tokusatsu nerdy side lit back up — probably ‘cause things finally got sorted out for our unit…”
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tomoya awkward %}
…Well, I’m really glad everyone is having fun while helping us, but…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tomoya serious %}
We still don’t actually know if this’ll solve everything yet, so let’s fire ourselves up and do what we gotta do.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mitsuru fist %}
Mhm! It’s time to overthrow “Bishojo-senpai”~! Hip-hip-hurray! ☆
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Hajime awkward %}
W-We aren’t fighting against Idea-sama[^6], you know~…? I really don’t think you should pick fights whenever you can, Mitsuru-kun…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tomoya smile2 %}
Yeah, this is probably going to be a battle against ourselves.
{% endbubble %}
