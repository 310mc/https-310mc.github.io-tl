### Day 1

{% bubble Tetora v2 %}
**Ossu! I’m Ryuseitai’s Ryusei Black, Nagumo Tetora!**

Our album’s finally gonna be on sale!

It has all our unit songs in it, including our solo songs.

I feel a li'l tingly about my solo, personally… It’s my first time makin' one, so…

But having my own song feels real special. It gives me strength!

We sung every song with all our feelings, so please listen to them!

Also, starting today, each Ryuseitai member'll have somethin' to say.

**Please look forward to seeing whose comment is next!**

I’m Ryuseitai’s Ryusei Green, Takamine Midori…

Umm, we’re going to release an album, so… It’d make me happy if you could give it a listen…

I didn’t really notice it until now, but we really have sung a lot of songs, huh…

And this time around, I got to sing a solo for the first time… I hope there’s something in it you could relate to…

There’s also a new unit song in the album, so please look forward to listening to it.

This was Takamine Midori speaking. Please look forward to seeing who’s next…

{% bubble Shinobu v2 %}
This is Ryuseitai’s Ryusei Yellow, Sengoku Shinobu!

The long-awaited album for Ryuseitai will be on sale in two days~♪

The album contains my own solo!

It's a song filled with everything related to ninjas, so I would be very happy to know if I was able to convey the beauty of ninjas to you!

Also, each of our solos are unique in their own way.

The album has all our songs up until now, as well as a new unit song, so I do hope you find a song you love!

This has been Sengoku Shinobu! Do look forward to tomorrow~☆

{% bubble Chiaki v2 %}
**Ossu! I’m Ryuseitai’s Ryusei Red, Morisawa Chiaki!**

It’s finally the long-awaited album release day!

I’ve also been waiting forever for it to be released!

Have you checked when the store opens? And you’ve got your wallet with you too, right?

<big><b>Then let’s go[^1] to the CD store together right away! ☆</b></big>

Oh, wait! I have to talk about my thoughts on the album first!

This album is a compilation of all our songs. I’d love it if you could take your time to listen to each song one by one!

When we listened to it again, we talked all about how it reminded us of all kinds of things.

Of how we spent our days performing live shows, seeing so many people smile, and gaining energy from their smiles.

**You give us so much energy just by cheering for us — Nothing could make us happier than that!**

**It’s the very moment that makes us feel extremely glad to be idols! Thank you!**

So we wanted to try and show our feelings of gratitude somehow, and—

{% bubble Tetora v2 %}
**Hold it right there! Stop!! Taichou, wait a sec!!**

**You don’t plan on saying everything all by yourself, right!?**
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki v2 %}
Ooh, Black! I know you all have something you wanted to say too, but I got a bit ahead of myself…!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora v2 %}
I get how you feel, but we won’t have anything to say at this point…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori sigh %}
Well, I wouldn’t have to talk then, so that’d be a lifesaver…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shinobu v2 %}
This is the last day, you know? That is why we planned to surprise the fans with each of us saying something.

But in the end, it just ended up as it always does… It is never the way we first thought it through.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata v2 %}
now, now. we do not need to be formal about this, anyway. it is much more like us to simply do it the usual way…♪

now then, chiaki. please continue what you were saying, as our [taichou].
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki grin %}
**Yep! Thanks, Kanata.**

Ahem.

Anyway! We were thinking of how we should show our feelings of gratitude to you, and decided to show it by contributing to the final design of the album.

It should be very clear what we did to it, so please do get the real thing and find out what it is…☆

As for us, we’ll continue holding more and more live shows that’ll cheer you right up!

I hope our voices reach you! And if they do, then please cheer for us as loud as you can! It’ll make us happy!

**That’s all from us! These were our thoughts on the album’s release day!**

**Please keep supporting Ryuseitai~! ☆**
