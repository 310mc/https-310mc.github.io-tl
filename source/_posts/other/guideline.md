<p><b>These are my personal preferences. Other translators may differ from the following, so please respect each of their wishes.</b></p>
<p style="color:blue"><b>I permit:</b></p>

※ Taking screenshots of my translations. You don't have to credit me unless you prefer to.
※ Re-translating my translations into a different language. I'd love it if you could give me a heads up in an email ( contact 310mctranslations@gmail.com ), though!
※ Linking my translations in directories, etc. This means you're free to copy the URL of a translation and link it on a page. __Please note that some translations may be on hold indefinitely.__
※ Using my __non-story translations__ (ex. card quotes, skill names, etc...) in the Enstars Wiki.
※ Using my translations in quotebots, fanworks, story analysis, etc. You don't have to credit me unless you prefer to.
※ Adjusting my translations in quotebots/fanworks/etc. for any of the following reasons:
1. Changing the speech quirk for consistency/preference
2. Adjusting pronouns to name, or name to pronoun for clarification
3. Changing nicknames/namings for consistency/preference
4. Adjusting grammar or punctuation for clarification

<p style="color:red"><b>I do not permit:</b></p>

※ I do __NOT__ permit changing the original intent/script of my translations in any way. That would simply be a mistranslation of the original text, and I don't approve of that. __This includes using inspect tool to change the script of the translation and then taking a screenshot of it.__

※ I do __NOT__ permit profiting off of my translations in any way. I don't do my unofficial translations for profit and I would like them to stay as __non-profit__. Please keep in mind that __unofficial translations are typically illegal__ and this would cause legal repercussions on both parties.

__All of the above applies ONLY to translations published on the 310mc.github.io site.__ For example, if there is a translation in here that links to a different site for a certain chapter, you must follow the terms and conditions of that translator, NOT mine.

If you have any inquiries, please ask me on <a href="https://twitter.com/310mc1" target="_blank">twitter</a>, or send an email to 310mctranslations@gmail.com .

## Reporting Mistakes

If you ever spot a typo, mistranslation, grammar or punctuation error in my translations;

Or if you spot an error (broken TL note, glitch, etc.) on the site;

Please feel free to let me know by messaging me on <a href="https://twitter.com/310mc1" target="_blank">twitter</a> or sending an email ( contact 310mctranslations@gmail.com )! I'd be happy to know of any problems in my translations or website. Thank you!
