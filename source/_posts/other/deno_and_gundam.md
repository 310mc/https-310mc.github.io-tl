## Context

Chiaki despises eggplants in every way; appearance, taste, even hearing its name disgusts him. See <a href="https://twitter.com/310mc1/status/1806293866036769183" target="_blank">here for more information</a>.

In VS★GOURMET, <a href="/vs_gourmet/flood_of_customers#Chapter-3" target="_blank">Flood of Customers 3</a>, Chiaki is faced with his worst enemy, eggplants. But hope is not all lost, because he comes up with a plan to overcome them.

{% bubble Chiaki srsthinking %}
<th>(—Hold on. It’s because it’s <em>me</em> trying to harvest the eggplants that I find it impossible. However, if I were to let Takamine possess me inside…?)</th>

<th>(Takamine is a boy who loves vegetables, suited to don the Green of compassion.)</th>

<th>(So if I let him possess me, then wouldn’t even I, the weakest person against eggplants, be capable of fighting against them…!?)</th>
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki fist %}
It’s Den-O ♪ Den-O! ♪
{% endbubble %}

Chiaki’s plan may be out of the ordinary, but it’s actually a very appropriate reference here; that is <u>exactly</u> how Kamen Rider Den-O works!

## Kamen Rider Den-O

{% img https://i.ibb.co/Hz0TCH7/Den-O-Poster.jpg %}

Released in 2007, <a href="https://kamenrider.fandom.com/wiki/Kamen_Rider_Den-O" target="_blank">Kamen Rider Den-O</a> is a little bit unique from other Kamen Riders (Masked Riders). The main character, Ryotaro, has the capability to transform into Kamen Rider, but in his early stages, his will is still too weak to use his Kamen Rider form all on his own. Instead, **Ryotaro starts out fighting with the help of outer beings called “Imagin”.**

### How does it work?

* Each Imagin comes in a **different color and weapon choice**. The main Imagins that fight alongside Ryotaro are <a href="https://kamenrider.fandom.com/wiki/Momotaros" target="_blank">Momotaros</a> (red), <a href="https://kamenrider.fandom.com/wiki/Urataros" target="_blank">Urataros</a> (blue), <a href="https://kamenrider.fandom.com/wiki/Kintaros" target="_blank">Kintaros</a> (yellow) and <a href="https://kamenrider.fandom.com/wiki/Ryutaros" target="_blank">Ryutaros</a> (purple).

<table style="text-align:center;">
    <tr>
        <th>
            <img src="https://i.ibb.co/pL25X1r/GRoh5-L0-X0-AIs-y-S.jpg" alt="Ryotaro surrounded by the Imagin that fight by his side">
            Ryotaro surrounded by the Imagin that fight by his side
        </th>
    </tr>
</table>

* Their physical appearance (seen above) are based on Ryotaro’s imagination. Ryotaro loves Japanese folklore, such as the Tale of Momotaro, because he looked up to the main characters as his heroes. Each Imagin took on the form of a character from one of these folktales.

![](https://i.ibb.co/gw22bqG/GRwi-Jwm-W0-AA7-is.jpg)
{% endgrouppicture %}

* The Imagin can possess Ryotaro’s body. When possessing him, the Imagin have **full control over his actions**. His appearance also changes a little to match their color and personality.

<table style="text-align:center;">
    <tr>
        <th>
            <img src="https://i.ibb.co/p1NDrp2/GRoh6-DMXIAATINQ.jpg" alt="Ryotaro’s appearance when possessed by one of the Imagins">
            Ryotaro’s appearance when possessed by one of the Imagins
        </th>
    </tr>
</table>

* If the Imagin possess Ryotaro without giving a heads up in advance, Ryotaro may lose consciousness and not remember anything that happened while he was possessed.

* Only one Imagin can possess Ryotaro’s body at a time. They can then **transform into their respective Rider form** when it’s time to fight.

<table style="text-align:center;">
    <tr>
        <th>
            <img src="https://i.ibb.co/9yPrjvm/plat.jpg" alt="From left to right: Ryotaro as Kamen Rider (Plat Form), Momotaros (Sword Form), Urataros (Rod Form), Kintaros (Axe Form), Ryutaros (Gun Form)">
            From left to right: Ryotaro as Kamen Rider (Plat Form), Momotaros (Sword Form), Urataros (Rod Form), Kintaros (Axe Form), Ryutaros (Gun Form)
        </th>
    </tr>
</table>

* BUT, Ryotaro can also take the initiative himself and **choose which Imagin to be possessed by** when transforming into Kamen Rider. In doing so, he’ll take on the Imagin’s Kamen Rider form, and the Imagin will have control over his body. See this 15 second video for an idea.

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/zetpAkd5yfU?si=OCoBotlhhcj-QEoD" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>

* For the above video, note how Ryotaro’s voice changes to the Imagin’s as soon as the transformation is complete, indicating he’s now possessed by the Imagin as well.

* While in Kamen Rider form, Ryotaro can telepathically communicate with the Imagin. The Imagin has free will to abide by Ryotaro’s ideas/wishes or not, and typically, they work together to defeat the monster of the week.

* Since each Imagin has his own unique weapon, one Imagin can be more advantageous than the other in a fight depending on the monster of the week.

**!! Spoilers for Kamen Rider Den-O !!** <span class="spoiler-text">Eventually, Ryotaro’s will grows strong enough to fight on his own with his own unique Kamen Rider form and weapon (made by the Imagin that fight alongside him). In his unique form, he isn’t being possessed by any Imagin.</span>

### Breakdown of Chiaki’s plan

Now, we can link this back to Chiaki’s strategy. Let’s compare it to Kamen Rider Den-O.

<table>
    <tr>
        <th style="width:50%">
            Typical episode in Kamen Rider Den-O
        </th>
        <th style="width:50%">

    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>
            Monster of the week appears. Ryotaro must defeat it to save everyone.
        </td>
        <td>
            Chiaki is faced with eggplants, his worst enemy. Chiaki must harvest them to complete his assistance work.
        </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>
            Ryotaro can/does transform into Kamen Rider, but he’s not capable of defeating the monster on his own.
        </td>
        <td>
            Chiaki can/does transform into the hero Ryusei Red, but he’s not capable of harvesting eggplants as himself.
        </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>
            Ryotaro chooses one of the Imagin’s Kamen Rider forms to transform into, usually based on what would be advantageous against the monster.
        </td>
        <td>
            Chiaki decides to become Midori to fight against them, because Midori is “a boy who loves vegetables”. To do this, Chiaki imagines himself being possessed by Midori, the same way Imagin possess Ryotaro’s body.
        </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>
            Once transformed into Kamen Rider, the Imagin takes over Ryotaro’s body and fights as Kamen Rider.
        </td>
        <td>
             Once he transforms into Midori, he becomes capable of fighting against eggplants (leading him to successfully hold an eggplant, as shown in his CG)
        </td>
    </tr>
</table>

Chiaki lives his life through the things he learns from  tokusatsu shows, so despite the plan’s peculiarity, it works for him!

<big>If you’re interested in watching Kamen Rider Den-O, Toei has uploaded the first two episodes on YouTube with English subtitles! <b><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPm_Dqy1Hpk" target="_blank">Episode 1</a> — <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqN67eKdOYA" target="_blank">Episode 2</a></b></big>

## Mobile Suit Gundam 00

{% img https://i.ibb.co/StBFdm2/Mobile-Suit-Gundam-00.jpg %}

{% bubble Chiaki hidden %}
“—I… I AM TAKAMINE NOWWWWWW!!”
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori glare %}
That’s Gundam. It’s not even Den-O.
{% endbubble %}

Midori’s response in <a href="/vs_gourmet/flood_of_customers#Chapter-4" target="_blank">Flood of Customers 4</a> is related to the last thing Chiaki says. In Japanese, Chiaki says <em>ore ga takamine da</em>.

This is exactly how the main character, Setsuna, says one of his most famous lines in Gundam 00, <em>ore ga gundam da</em> (I am Gundam). See this 10 second video for the scene.

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/v-PzT82C_Mc?si=uQygIbitsqgjLaNb" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>

Released in 2007, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_Suit_Gundam_00" target="_blank">Mobile Suit Gundam 00</a> is one of the more well-known Gundam series. This particular line is a **very famous** quote and a popular meme in the fandom.

### Context behind the line

{% grouppicture 2-2 %}

{% endgrouppicture %}

* <a href="https://gundam.fandom.com/wiki/Setsuna_F._Seiei" target="_blank">Setsuna</a> was a child soldier in a war between his country and another kingdom. When he was a child soldier, he was rescued just before death by the Gundam “GN-000 0 Gundam”. He was the sole survivor of that battle.
* After being rescued by 0 Gundam, he grew to believe that Gundams are saviors.
* This is why he says “I am Gundam” a lot. He has a strong desire to become Gundam in order to end all conflict, as well as bring mutual understanding and peace through Gundam. 

Just like Chiaki, Midori’s reference is appropriate here. <em>ore ga [something] da</em> isn’t a quote you’d hear at all in Kamen Rider Den-O, and most people will immediately think of Gundam 00 as the reference. I recommend watching Gundam 00 if you’re interested in dramatic and serious plots!

That’s all for the explanation! Everything after this is extra fun information if you’d like to learn more ♪ Click <a href="/vs_gourmet" target="_blank">here</a> to go back to reading VS★GOURMET~

## Extra Information

Kamen Rider Den-O is often referenced in Ryuseitai stories! Chiaki usually references it, but Tetora has referenced it before as well.

* Chiaki has referenced <a href="https://kamenrider.fandom.com/wiki/Momotaros" target="_blank">Momotaro’s</a> (red Imagin) catchphrases: <em>ore sanjou!</em> (I have arrived!) and <em>ore wa saisho kara saigo made kuraimakkusu da ze</em> (I’m at a climax from start to end)
* Tetora has referenced <a href="https://kamenrider.fandom.com/wiki/Ryutaros" target="_blank">Ryutaros’</a> (purple Imagin) catchphrase: <em>omae taosu kedo ii? kotae wa kiitenai!</em> (Mind if I defeat you? Not that I’ll listen to your answer!)
* I recommend checking <a href="https://twitter.com/xvxaerial/status/1810474067209904433" target="_blank">xvxaerial</a>’s compilation for more references!
* **If you’re a RyuseitaiP, I recommend watching Kamen Rider Den-O.** Not only is it referenced in Ryuseitai stories, but the storyline is fun and newbie-friendly to people new to tokusatsu shows!

**(SPECULATION ONLY!!)** When Chiaki’s VS★GOURMET bloomed CG appears in the story, Chiaki transforms into Midori to face eggplants once more. There is green shading on the tips of his hair. This is possibly a reference to how body possession works in Kamen Rider Den-O: When an Imagin takes over Ryotaro’s body, his hair changes a bit in color!

### Did you know…?

**Please note:** The following information about Kamen Rider Den-O has NOT been discussed or referenced in any canon content before. It’s simply an interesting observation I noticed about Den-O’s Imagins, and includes my own personal interpretation of the Enstars canon text.

* Imagin are considered <em>kaijin</em> monsters in <a href="https://www.kamen-rider-official.com/zukan/phantoms/mode/categories?utf8=%E2%9C%93&phantom%5Bkamen_rider_id%5D=8" target="_blank">tokusatsu lore</a>. Kaijin are humanoid villains that commonly appear in tokusatsu shows.

* Imagin can either be on the side of justice or evil. The ones on the side of justice help Ryotaro or other heroes fight the evil Imagin (these are the monsters of the week).

* Imagin can only possess humans after forging a contract. To entice the human into agreeing, the Imagin approach their target with this: “Say your wish. I can grant any wish. You can pay me with one thing only.”

Personally, I think that this theme of "even kaijin can come in justice or evil" is similar to themes found in Ryuseitai’s stories!

For example, Kanata has mentioned before that he empathizes more with the villains of tokusatsu shows, i.e. the <em>kaijin</em> (<a href="/aquarium/prologue" target="_blank">Aquarium, Prologue</a>). And in <a href="/parallel_world" target="_blank">Parallel World</a>, Kanata has to act as the <em>kaijin</em> monster, i.e. the villain the heroes have to defeat. But at that moment, Midori speaks up and suggests to let Kanata be part of their hero squad despite being a monster. Even monsters can be part of justice. They can be heroes!

(**Note:** “Wish” is <em>nozomi</em> in Den-O. On the other hand, when Kanata was a god, he would say <em>negai</em> for wish.)

Most of all, <a href="/supervillain" target="_blank">Supervillain</a> explores the idea of a hero dyed in evil! Once again, I really recommend watching the series if you’re RyuseitaiP ♪

<!--Lastly, Imagin’s physical form is based on the host’s imagination. For example: Ryotaro’s Imagins are all based on main characters from Japanese folklore because Ryotaro looked up to them as his heroes. Meanwhile, Chiaki built up the Ryuseitai from Yumenosaki days based on his own ideals and dreams! Ryuseitai’s-->
