## Translation Notes

[^1]: Yuruchara, <em>yuru</em> meaning “loose,” “soft,” “laid-back,” + the word “character”. <em>Yuruchara</em> are mascot characters, their defining features are that they have very peculiar designs, ranging from bizarre-cute to adorkable, as well as being used all across Japan for PR purposes, in companies, prefectures, etc… For more information please see <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/yuruchara" target="_blank">this</a>.
[^2]: He says <em>boku</em> here for “me” instead of <em>sessha</em> (the typical way Shinobu talks as a ninja).
