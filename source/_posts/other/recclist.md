There's two typical ways to read Enstars stories: either through release order (the general way fans experience the storyline), or by chronological order (reading the progress/development of the characters in a linear fashion)

Release order would mean starting from 2015 stories and then going up the years. It's generally recommended to do it this way! The only two heads up I have are:

- The early stories have a bit of outdated writing, especially in terms of writer growth

- It's good to know where the story is placed in the timeline. The easiest way to know is to check the season the story happens in, is it Spring, Autumn, etc... Spring would mean it's a story pretty early into the year (like start of the school term), and Winter would mean late into the year (like new year or graduation season), so on and so forth. Seasons can be checked on the Wiki, but some translations have the season attached to them as well.

For a general understanding of the release order of all Enstars stories, that can be found on the Wiki.

now onto the ryuseitai story list... some notes:

- I'll be listing it in release order

- I know I've listed a lot of stories here, so I've added // slashes and bolded the ones to read that help better understand ryuseitai's storyline and development

- some stories don't have all of ryuseitai in it but are related to ryuseitai's storyline. i'll mention which characters they have!

- a lot of non-ryuseitai stories cover a decent chunk of their individual development and character as well. i'll add bonus stories to read alongside the stories in those cases in case you want even more to read

- there is a translation masterlist here to look for story translations!

- some 2015-2016 story translations for ryuseitai can be found in doublerainbow82 and enstars-translates's blogs

2015:

// Hero Show

Pirate Festival

// Christmas Live → for shinobu (and kanata), bonus story to read is Crash Course!

Toryumon

Study Heroes → 1-chaptered idol story

2020+ (!! Era):

Idol Story 1 → their individual character stories that came with !! era are a great way to start reading !! era stories. they're short and quick to read too. all can be read on engstars. for fantl: midori - chiaki. bonus stories are their idol story 2, which involve either one ryuseitai member or all of them! here is kanata's

// !! Era 1st Main Story (full story can only be read on engstars) → ryuseitai is only in a few chapters but what happens to them here is pretty important

// Motor Show → for tetora, bonus story to read is War at the End of Century/Turn of the Century Wars!

// Comet Show

Ninja Clan

SS Finals (releasing soon on engstars) → ryuseitai isn't in all the chapters but their scenes are good

// Supervillain → for tetora and midori, bonus story to read is high and low (by creampuffs)! and for tetora and shinobu, bonus story is blackjack!

Parallel World → ryuseitai only appear in one chapter, and the link is a translation of only that chapter.

// Tropical

and finally, bonus content is their birthday stories

there are even more stories for them individually than what's listed here, but hopefully this helps give a visual of what to start with... it's okay to go slow with reading though. especially with how many stories there are now, it's no doubt overwhelming at first...

as for a chronological order of ryuseitai's stories, check out this list by citrinesea (it also lists akatsuki as well) or the timeline on the wiki!

feel free to ask any other questions, or to let me know if anything is unclear, i'd be glad to help!!
