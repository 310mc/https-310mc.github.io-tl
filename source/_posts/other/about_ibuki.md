## Introduction

Before Ibuki Taki was introduced as a new character on April 26 2024, Ibuki was hinted in previously released stories. In this post, I've answered common questions about the stories prior to his appearance in the audition main story.

<h2 id="q1" class="FAQ-question">Q. Which stories have hints of Ibuki and his family?</h2>
<div class="FAQ-answer">
The main stories are:
<ul>
<li><b>Submarine:</b> Started the story arc for Ryuseitai, making connections to Okinawa. Does not really have any Ibuki information at all, and rather acts as a means to establish the storyline.</li>

<li><b>Supervillain:</b> </li>

<li><b>Atlantis:</b> A story that happens before Stella Maris</li>

<li><b>Stella Maris:</b> The story to have the most information about Ibuki and his family.</li>
</ul>

submarine started it all (but doesn't have much to do with ibuki's family except the tiniest "strained back" grandpa hint), supervillain mentions quite a bit about okinawa, and then stella maris delves pretty deep into it! i hope you enjoy reading, it's an intriguing storyline!!

fun fact there's even a new okinawan restaurant near ES now, this was revealed in fine's climax event lol not sure if it's based on the exact same restaurant as ibuki's grandpa BUT it does use the same background as that restaurant! (on that note, fine climax event is a bonus story to read since it's related to stella maris)

<h2 id="q2" class="FAQ-question">Q. What do we learn about Ibuki and his family from the above stories?</h2>
<div class="FAQ-answer">
Here is a run-down of Ibuki (not the full list):

* Oni originally referred to ibuki's grandpa, and eventually became about him too

* Ibuki's grandpa is very well-known in the Okinawa main land, so Ibuki and Mizusaba also have influence around the area

* Ibuki calls himself the descendant of Oni, likely because he is the "2nd generation of oni". the 1st generation is his grandpa. hence being a descendant!

* Ibuki is Mizusaba's younger brother, but ibuki is so respected and reliable in the community that he's everyone's "big brother", so even mizusaba calls him by an older brother naming

* It seems Ibuki got interested to go to Japan thanks to niceP's invitation. after arriving in japan and presumably meeting up with niceP (idol story 1), he somehow hears that Crimson Production got taken down by tetora, so he tries to go meet tetora to learn more about him

<h2 id="q3" class="FAQ-question">Q. What's the context behind Ibuki Idol Story 2?</h2>
<div class="FAQ-answer">
Ibuki Idol Story 2 mainly has to do with <b><a href="/supervillain" target="_blank">Supervillain</a></b>. Here is a breakdown of the events:

note: from here on is my own personal attempt to compile the events!! i'm talking based on my own understanding of the events

**Note:** From here on is my own personal attempt to compile the events!! i'm talking based on my own understanding of the events

Prior to Supervillain and its events, the Oni vigilante group and Crimson Production were enemies, and the Oni group were the first people to go against Crimson Production and take them down. After defeating Crimson Production, the group eventually disbands, likely because the boss leaves for the US. This boss is very likely to be Ibuki, as he had left for the US at some point. This weakened the group since then (supersized villain ch5)

By the time Supervillain happens, Crimson Production revived itself, and became a *lot* stronger than before because it fed on the Okinawans' fear and hatred of ES. It became so strong in Okinawa that even the members who were in the Oni vigilante group joined Crimson Production. (supersized villain ch6)

*This* is the part that Tetora is talking about with Ibuki! tetora seems to hold conflicting feelings about his decision to take down Crimson Production, and one of them is because he feels like he may have "a lot of unsettled business" (stella maris hidden island 2). while he's glad that the evil Crimson Production was defeated, he feels like he might have made people who weren't 100% evil suffer in the process (he mentions these conflicting thoughts in supervillain, supersized villain ch15), so it tends to weigh on his mind. this is shown in stella maris, where he constantly fidgets whenever he's reminded of his time as a spy for Crimson Production, and even says he sees it as his dark past.

In Ibuki's Idol Story 2, ibuki doesn't fully confirm to tetora he's the boss, but based on the information we know and their dialogue in the story (boss went to the US, group had a descendant of oni), it should be him anyway? which means he was part of taking down Crimson Production the first time around.

this is the part that tetora mentions to ibuki! tetora seems to hold conflicting feelings about his decision to take down Crimson Production, and one of them is because he feels like he may have "a lot of unsettled business" (stella maris hidden island 2). while he's glad that the evil Crimson Production was defeated, he feels like he might have made people who weren't 100% evil suffer in the process (he mentions these conflicting thoughts in supervillain, supersized villain ch15), so it tends to weigh on his mind. this is shown in stella maris, where he constantly fidgets whenever he's reminded of his time as an ES spy in Crimson Production, and even says he sees it as his dark past.

so when tetora learns ibuki is the boss of the vigilante group, he wonders if ibuki's here to take revenge for hurting those vigilante members that later on joined Crimson Production. it's hard to tell ibuki's feelings on this as he just says he won't take revenge because it's old-fashioned... but after getting a chance to throw a deadly kick at tetora and seeing tetora dodge it, he seems to be satisfied that tetora is the real deal. hence saying "i'm sure even the guys at Crimson Production were happy to get taken down by you" (which implies even the vigilante members who joined Crimson Production were "happy" about it too!)

beyond this, i'm not sure haha. this is my own interpretation, but it seems like ibuki gave tetora a reason to have beef with him (throwing sneak attacks on tetora in a "villain-y" way?), while ibuki feels satisfied enough to know tetora is genuinely strong (and potentially even capable of "exterminating" him, the ogre?). in his introduction quote, ibuki says that "he'll be looking into things with his own eyes and confirming it for himself", so that adds up with how he acted with tetora!

what makes this a bit confusing is that the vigilante group seems to have been called "oni", and the boss himself was known as oni too because of his ancestry. this is again my own interpretation, but i assume the oni family (ibuki and ibuki's grandpa) was just that influential, that even a whole group led by one of them is called oni.

the ones in hiding (or rather just don't interact with the public much) are the people of hoshijima, the oni family is well-known around okinawa! even have a restaurant that mizusaba is cook for (and their grandpa used to work in until he strained his back)

the series of events you wrote about the event stories is correct yeah!! hoshijima is a small island near the okinawa main island, so yes supervillain happened in okinawa main island, whereas stella maris went back and forth between the small island hoshijima and the main island.

hoshijima people have connections with the okinawan/oni family (but not necessarily the vigilante group...?), as they act as the mediators and the ones who send them supplies. it used to be the grandpa who'd send supplies, then became mizusaba! mizusaba mentioned that he's not a worshipper or anything, so i think they might not have anything to do with the religion per se...? hmm
