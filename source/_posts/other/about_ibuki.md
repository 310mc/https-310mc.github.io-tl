## Introduction

Before Ibuki Taki was introduced as a new character on April 26 2024, he was hinted in previously released stories. In this post, I’ve answered common questions about the stories **prior** to his appearance in the audition main story.

You can see Ibuki Taki’s profile on the <a href="https://ensemble-stars.fandom.com/wiki/Ibuki_Taki" target="_blank">Wiki</a>. See below for his Idol Story 1 and 2 (Released in April 2024).

<h2 id="q1" class="FAQ-question">Q. Which stories contain hints of Ibuki and his family?</h2>
<div class="FAQ-answer">
The stories are:

* <b>Submarine:</b> Ryuseitai and Akatsuki’s SS Qualifying Round story. Started the Okinawa story arc for Ryuseitai by establishing connections. Doesn’t contain any Ibuki information, and rather acts as a means to establish the storyline. Contains one tiny hint of Ibuki’s grandpa in <a href="/submarine/ruthless_battlefield/" target="_blank">Ruthless Battlefield, Okinawa 4</a>.

* <b>Supervillain:</b> A Ryuseitai story that happens in Okinawa. Contains hints about Ibuki and what he was doing before he went to the US. Talks about the Oni group and the descendant of Oni. Firmly establishes Tetora’s involvement in Okinawa.

* <b>Atlantis:</b> A <em>fine</em> story that happens before Stella Maris. Doesn’t contain any Ibuki hints, but it’s a good context provider for why <em>fine</em> is involved in Okinawa (and therefore Stella Maris as well). There’s one interesting part where <em>fine</em> are talking in a newly-established Okinawan restaurant based near ES. It uses the same background as the Okinawan restaurant Ryuseitai and Akatsuki were in during Submarine!

* <b>Stella Maris:</b> A Ryuseitai story that happens in Okinawa. This story has the most information about Ibuki and his family, especially in hidden island 10. I recommend reading the full story for all the information available.

<h2 id="q2" class="FAQ-question">Q. What do we learn about Ibuki and his family from the above stories?</h2>
<div class="FAQ-answer">

**A run-down of the main things we learn (not the full list):**

* Mizusaba is an NPC introduced in Stella Maris. Ibuki is very likely to be Mizusaba’s younger brother. If so, then according to Mizusaba, Ibuki is so respected and reliable in the community that he’s everyone’s “big brother”, so even Mizusaba calls him by an older brother naming.

* Ibuki’s grandfather was a feared pirate around Okinawa, known as “Oni”, who eventually settled down as he grew older. He likely works in a restaurant that he owns in Okinawa, but he currently has a strained back. He’s very well-known in the Okinawa main land, so Ibuki and Mizusaba also have influence around the area.

* While “Oni” originally referred to Ibuki’s grandfather, it eventually referred to Ibuki too.

* There was a vigilante group called “Oni” in Okinawa. When Crimson Production was causing problems in Okinawa, the Oni group took down the company. After defeating Crimson Production, the group disbanded likely because the boss went to the US.

* Ibuki and Mizusaba use a lot of Okinawan dialect, and from my own interpretation, I noticed that ibuki sees himself specifically as an Okinawan (with American influence) rather than a “Japanese person” born in Okinawa. What I mean by this is that he considers himself distinctly Okinawan (rather than Japanese), even though Okinawa is a prefecture in Japan.

**What we then learn from Ibuki’s Idol Story 1 and 2:**

* Ibuki calls himself the descendant of Oni, likely because he is the “second generation of Oni”. The first generation is his grandfather, hence being a descendant.

* The Oni vigilante group’s boss is very likely about Ibuki. The boss was said to have gone to the US, and Ibuki is also someone who was first born in Okinawa and then went to the US at some point.

* It seems that Ibuki got interested to go to Japan under Nice-P’s invitation. After arriving in Japan and presumably meeting up with Nice-P (Idol Story 1), he somehow hears that Crimson Production got taken down by Tetora, and then tries to go meet Tetora to learn more about him (Idol Story 2)
</div>

<h2 id="q3" class="FAQ-question">Q. What’s the context behind Ibuki Idol Story 2?</h2>
<div class="FAQ-answer">

Ibuki Idol Story 2 mainly has to do with <b><a href="/supervillain" target="_blank">Supervillain</a></b>. Here is a breakdown of the events. <b>Please Note:</b> this is my personal attempt to compile the events based on my own understanding.

Prior to Supervillain and its events, there was a time when Crimson Production had power in Okinawa. It was said to have “gone on a rampage” in the area, so a certain local Okinawan group wanted to take it down. This was the vigilante group called “Oni”, with their boss likely being the “descendant of Oni”.

The Oni vigilante group and Crimson Production were enemies, and the Oni group were the first people to go against Crimson Production and take it down. After defeating Crimson Production, the group eventually disbands after the boss leaves for the US. This boss is very likely to be Ibuki, as he had also left for the US at some point. This weakened the group since then. (<a href="/supervillain/supersized_villain" target="_blank">Supervillain, Supersized-Villain 5 & 7</a>)

By the time Supervillain happens, Crimson Production revived itself, and became a lot stronger than before because it fed on the Okinawans’ fear and hatred of ES. This fear and hatred harbored after the events of the SS qualifying round, due to ES’s invasive-like nature on the area. Crimson Production became so strong in Okinawa that even many members who were once in the Oni vigilante group joined Crimson Production. (<a href="/supervillain/supersized_villain" target="_blank">Supervillain, Supersized-Villain 7</a>)

<em>This</em> is the part that Tetora is talking about with Ibuki in Idol Story 2. Tetora seems to hold conflicting feelings about his decision to take down Crimson Production, and one of them is because he feels like he may have left the place with “a lot of unsettled business” (<a href="/stella_maris/hidden_island" target="_blank">Stella Maris, hidden island 2</a>). While he’s glad that the evil Crimson Production was defeated, he feels like he might have made people who weren’t 100% evil suffer in the process (he mentions these conflicting thoughts in <a href="/supervillain/supersized_villain_p2" target="_blank">Supervillain, Supersized-Villain 15</a>), so it tends to weigh on his mind. This is shown in Stella Maris, where he constantly fidgets whenever he’s reminded of his time as an ES spy infilterating Crimson Production, and even says he sees it as his dark past. (<a href="/stella_maris/hidden_island_p2" target="_blank">Stella Maris, hidden island 6 & 9</a>)

This is why, when Tetora learns Ibuki is the boss of the vigilante group Oni, he wonders if Ibuki’s here to take revenge for hurting those vigilante members that later on joined Crimson Production. It’s hard to tell Ibuki’s feelings on this as he just says he won’t take revenge because “it’s old-fashioned”… But after getting a chance to throw a deadly kick at Tetora and seeing Tetora dodge it, he seems to be satisfied that Tetora is the real deal. Hence saying “I’m sure even the guys at Crimson Production were happy to get taken down by you” (which implies even the vigilante members who joined Crimson Production were “happy” about it too.)

Unfortunately, I’m not sure about the implications beyond this. This is my own interpretation, but it seems like Ibuki gave Tetora a reason to keep him in mind (because he threw a sneak attack on Tetora in a “villain-y” way…?), while Ibuki feels satisfied enough to know Tetora is genuinely strong (and potentially even capable of “exterminating” him, the oni…?). In his introduction quote, Ibuki says that “I’ll be looking into things with my own eyes and confirming it for myself”, and that does add up with how he acted with Tetora.

What makes this a bit easy to mix up is that the vigilante group seems to have been called “Oni”, and the boss himself was known as Oni too because of his ancestry (Specifically, the *descendant* of Oni). This is again my own interpretation, but I assume the Oni family (Ibuki and Ibuki’s grandpa) was just that influential, that even a whole group led by one of them is called Oni rather than its own unique name. I could easily be wrong, though!

<h2 id="q4" class="FAQ-question">Q. What is the relationship between the people of Hoshijima and the Oni family?</h2>
<div class="FAQ-answer">

The people of Hoshijima didn’t get involved with anyone outside of “Hoshijima”, a small remote island a little far from the Okinawa main island. This changed when the ATLANTIS project came about, the one that Tori is handling as of the story Atlantis. Once the ATLANTIS project set in motion, the people of Hoshijima began to be a little more involved with people from the outside.

On the other hand, the Oni family (Ibuki, his grandfather, and Mizusaba) are well-known around Okinawa, and their grandfather likely even owns a restaurant in the Okinawa main island. Mizusaba works as a chef in it.

The Hoshijima people have connections with the Oni family, as they act as the mediators and the ones who send them supplies. It used to be the grandfather who’d send supplies to Hoshijima, and then it became Mizusaba. Mizusaba mentioned that they’re not a worshipper, so I think they might not have anything to do with Kanata’s religion. (<a href="/stella_maris/hidden_island_p2" target="_blank">Stella Maris, hidden island 4</a>)

In regards to the Oni family’s relationship with Hoshijima, the labels Mizusaba gave their family are “Mediators” and “Point of contact”, rather than protectors. Mizusaba also mentions that they’re an outsider in Hoshijima and doesn’t have any connections with the Hoshijima residents as of yet (Except for Konata). This is my own interpretation, but it implies to me that Mizusaba’s relationship with Konata is more of a personal one, hence why Mizusaba tends to try and help him.

That being said, there is still a lot we don’t know about the Oni family, so there may be new information in the future.

<h2 id="q5" class="FAQ-question">Q. What about Ibuki’s appearance in the audition?</h2>
<div class="FAQ-answer">

This post doesn’t cover any information from the audition (third venue, VS★AUDIENCE). The only thing I’ll say is that his scenes in the audition don’t confirm a majority of the information written here, so we <b>have yet to get the story that confirms all the facts.</b>
