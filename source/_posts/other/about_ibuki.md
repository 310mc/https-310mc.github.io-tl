## Introduction

Before Ibuki Taki was introduced as a new character on April 26 2024, Ibuki was hinted in previously released stories. In this post, I've answered common questions about the stories prior to his appearance in the audition main story.

<h2 id="q1" class="FAQ-question">Q. Which stories have hints of Ibuki and his family?</h2>
<div class="FAQ-answer">
The main stories are:

* <b>Submarine:</b> Ryuseitai and Akatsuki's SS Qualifying Round story. Started the Okinawa story arc for Ryuseitai by establishing connections. Doesn't contain any Ibuki information, and rather acts as a means to establish the storyline. Contains one tiny hint of Ibuki's grandpa in Chapter TBA

* <b>Supervillain:</b> A Ryuseitai story that happens in Okinawa. Contains hints about Ibuki and what he was doing before he went to the US. Talks about the Oni group and the descendant of Oni. Firmly establishes Tetora's involvement in Okinawa.

* <b>Atlantis:</b> A <em>fine</em> story that happens before Stella Maris. Doesn't contain any Ibuki hints, but it's a good context provider for why <em>fine</em> is involved in Stella Maris. There's one interesting part where <em>fine</em> are talking in a newly-established Okinawan restaurant based near ES. It uses the same background as the Okinawan restaurant Ryuseitai and Akatsuki were in during Submarine!

* <b>Stella Maris:</b> A Ryuseitai story that happens in Okinawa. This story has the most information about Ibuki and his family, especially in hidden island 10. I recommend reading the full story for all the information available.

<h2 id="q2" class="FAQ-question">Q. What do we learn about Ibuki and his family from the above stories?</h2>
<div class="FAQ-answer">
Here is a run-down of Ibuki (not the full list):

* Ibuki is Mizusaba's younger brother, but Ibuki is so respected and reliable in the community that he's everyone's “big brother”, so even Mizusaba calls him by an older brother naming.

* “Oni” originally referred to Ibuki's grandfather, and eventually became about him too.

* Ibuki's grandfather is very well-known in the Okinawa main land, so Ibuki and Mizusaba also have influence around the area.

* Ibuki calls himself the descendant of Oni, likely because he is the "second generation of Oni". The first generation is his grandfather, hence being a descendant!

* It seems Ibuki got interested to go to Japan under Nice-P's invitation. After arriving in Japan and presumably meeting up with Nice-P (Idol Story 1), he somehow hears that Crimson Production got taken down by Tetora, so he tries to go meet Tetora to learn more about him.

<h2 id="q3" class="FAQ-question">Q. What's the context behind Ibuki Idol Story 2?</h2>
<div class="FAQ-answer">
Ibuki Idol Story 2 mainly has to do with <b><a href="/supervillain" target="_blank">Supervillain</a></b>. Here is a breakdown of the events:


**Note:** This is my own personal attempt to compile the events! I'm talking based on my own understanding.

Prior to Supervillain and its events, there was a time when Crimson Production had power in Okinawa. It wasn't a well-liked company, and the Okinawan locals wanted to take it down. These Okinawan locals gathered as a vigilante group called “Oni”, with their boss being the “descendant of Oni.”

The Oni vigilante group and Crimson Production were enemies, and the Oni group were the first people to go against Crimson Production and take it down. After defeating Crimson Production, the group eventually disbands, likely because the boss leaves for the US. This boss is very likely to be Ibuki, as he had also left for the US at some point. This weakened the group since then. (Supervillain, Supersized-Villain 5)

By the time Supervillain happens, Crimson Production revived itself, and became a *lot* stronger than before because it fed on the Okinawans' fear and hatred of ES. This fear and hatred harbored after the events of the SS qualifying rounds, due to ES's invasive-like nature on the prefecture. Crimson Production became so strong in Okinawa that even the members who were in the Oni vigilante group joined Crimson Production. (Supervillain, Supersized-Villain 6)

*This* is the part that Tetora is talking about with Ibuki in Idol Story 2. Tetora seems to hold conflicting feelings about his decision to take down Crimson Production, and one of them is because he feels like he may have "a lot of unsettled business" (Stella Maris hidden island 2). While he's glad that the evil Crimson Production was defeated, he feels like he might have made people who weren't 100% evil suffer in the process (he mentions these conflicting thoughts in Supervillain, Supersized-Villain 15), so it tends to weigh on his mind. This is shown in Stella Maris, where he constantly fidgets whenever he's reminded of his time as an ES spy infilterating Crimson Production, and even says he sees it as his dark past. (Stella Maris hidden island 6)

So when Tetora learns Ibuki is the boss of the vigilante group Oni, he wonders if Ibuki's here to take revenge for hurting those vigilante members that later on joined Crimson Production. It's hard to tell Ibuki's feelings on this as he just says he won't take revenge because “it's old-fashioned”... But after getting a chance to throw a deadly kick at Tetora and seeing Tetora dodge it, he seems to be satisfied that Tetora is the real deal. Hence saying "I'm sure even the guys at Crimson Production were happy to get taken down by you" (which implies even the vigilante members who joined Crimson Production were "happy" about it too!)

> FIX In Ibuki's Idol Story 2, Ibuki doesn't fully confirm to Tetora he's the boss, but based on the information we know and their dialogue in the story (boss went to the US, group had a descendant of oni), it should be him anyway? which means he was part of taking down Crimson Production the first time around.

I'm not sure about the implications beyond this. This is my own interpretation, but it seems like Ibuki gave Tetora a reason to feel conflicted about him (throwing sneak attacks on Tetora in a "villain-y" way?), while Ibuki feels satisfied enough to know Tetora is genuinely strong (and potentially even capable of "exterminating" him, the ogre?). In his introduction quote, Ibuki says that "I'll be looking into things with my own eyes and confirming it for myself", so that adds up with how he acted with Tetora!

What makes this a bit easy to mix up is that the vigilante group seems to have been called "Oni", and the boss himself was known as Oni too because of his ancestry (Specifically, the *descendant* of Oni). This is again my own interpretation, but I assume the Oni family (Ibuki and Ibuki's grandpa) was just that influential, that even a whole group led by one of them is called Oni.

<h2 id="q4" class="FAQ-question">Q. What about the people of Hoshijima? Are they connected to the Oni family?</h2>
<div class="FAQ-answer">
The ones in hiding (or, rather just don't interact with the public much) are the people of Hoshijima Island, a remote island a little far from the Okinawa main island. The Oni family is well-known around Okinawa, and even have a restaurant that Mizusaba is a cook for. Their grandfather used to work in it until he strained his back.


> FIX The series of events you wrote about the event stories is correct yeah!! hoshijima is a small island near the okinawa main island, so yes supervillain happened in okinawa main island, whereas stella maris went back and forth between the small island hoshijima and the main island.

Hoshijima people have connections with the Okinawan Oni family (but not necessarily the vigilante group that's called Oni, maybe...?), as they act as the mediators and the ones who send them supplies. it used to be the grandfather who'd send supplies, and then it became Mizusaba! Mizusaba mentioned that he's not a worshipper or anything, so I think they might not have anything to do with Kanata's religion.

In regards to the Oni family's relationship with Hoshijima, the label Mizusaba gave their family is "Mediators" and "Point of contact", rather than protectors. When Ryuseitai try to learn more about the Hoshijima residents, Mizusaba explains to them that they're just ordinary people with a unique religion, which personally sounds to me that Mizusaba is speaking as an outsider of the Hoshijima group. Mizusaba also mentions that they don't actually have connections with the Hoshijima residents (Except for Konata). This is my own interpretation, but it implies to me that Mizusaba's relationship with konata is more of a personal one, hence why they tend to try and help him.

That all being said, there may be way more to the Oni family's backstory and origins that we still don't know. The farthest we know is that their grandfather was a feared pirate around Okinawa who eventually settled down as he grew older (I tried to search where Akira got this inspiration from, and only found one historical figure but not sure if that's where it's from... yet). The family also uses a lot of Okinawan dialect, and from my own interpretation, I noticed that ibuki sees himself specifically as an Okinawan (with American influence) rather than a "Japanese person" born in Okinawan. What I mean by this is that there's a clear distinction being made here, even though Okinawa is a prefecture in Japan.
