<th>(Hmhmhmmm~♪ You’ve always gotta ask an idol whenever you’re in trouble!)</th>

<th>(Though, well— I wasn’t actually in trouble or anything…)</th>

<th>(But UNDEAD taught me a valuable lesson in Idol ☆ Hijack: It’s important to do the norm without complaints!)</th>

<th>(I thought going to school would be a waste of time, but since I got advice from idols, I figured that I could try going to my club…)</th>

<th>(And boy, was that the bestest, greatest idea I’ve ever had! Both Morisawa-senpai and Takamine-senpai were there!)</th>

<th>(I couldn’t take my eyes off of them, not when they were wearing basketball uniforms for once! It was like candid photos flashing before my eyes! So raa~vely!)</th>

<th>(Everything’s all thanks to that radio!)</th>

<th>(I wanna send them another message thanking them, but UNDEAD aren’t the hosts this month.)</th>

<th>(I could also just thank them in person, but you’re not supposed to do that as a fan. I gotta make a line between what I do in my private time and what I do for work as an idol.)</th>

<th>(Besides, it’ll be tricky to send a message on another occasion if they find out that the “Love-swan” pen name was me.)</th>

<th>(I did my best keeping it a secret that every week, I’ve been listening to their podcast in bed with my earphones! I don’t want all of my effort to go to waste!)</th>[^1]

<th>(—… Oh, he’s here!)</th>

{% bubble Midori %}
<th>(Sigh… so depressing…)</th>

<th>(That guy told me upfront that he’s showing up to the club as a former club member, so I tried coming, too…)</th>

<th>(But the club recently got a lot of new members I dunno anything about… and it was painful being asked for basketball advice…)</th>

<th>(I’m not an expert in basketball. You guys need to ask someone who’s actually passionate about it.)</th>

<th>(They asked me if I could show up to the club again while I was getting ready to go home, but I’m gonna be busy with work for a while… so it makes sense if I can’t come, right? Right.)</th>

<th>(I’m gonna try avoiding our clubroom so they don’t talk to me…)</th>

<th>(I left the place as fast as I could, but maybe I should wait for Morisawa-senpai…)</th>

<th>(He said that he’s going to the staff room first, though… Mmm…)</th>

<th>(I dunno when he’s coming back, so I can just go back on my own, right…)</th>

<th>(Yeah, let’s go. Sigh, so tired…)</th>

{% bubble Aira %}
Takamine-senpai, thank you for your hard work today!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
—W-Woah?

You surprised me… Umm, you’re Shiratori-kun from Alkaloid, right? Uh, what’re you doing here…?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Aira %}
I was waiting for you. I wanted to talk to you about the Basketball Club.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
Basketball Club…?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Aira %}
We were on the same team today. Did you forget already?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
<th>(Is he one of the many first years in the club…? I must’ve not noticed him there. I was avoiding eye contact with them so they wouldn’t ask me any questions.)</th>

Sorry, I don’t remember.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Aira %}
<th>(Ahaha… That’s kind of a shame.)</th>

Please don’t worry about it! I’m happy enough that we were on the same team together~♪

If you’re heading for the dormitory, could we go there together?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
<th>(Uuu… I wanna say no… I can’t walk with people I don’t know well… I wouldn’t know what to talk about…)</th>

<th>(But I just said that I don’t remember him, so I’m already starting to feel bad…)</th>

… Sure, why not.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Aira %}
Yaaay! ♪ Thank you so much, Takamine-senpai~☆
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
M-Mhm…

<th>(I’m such a bore to be with, though… He’s just gonna be disappointed…)</th>

—And the look you had in your eyes right when you got the ball was super duper ra-vely!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
“Ra-vely”…?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Aira %}
Yes! The sweat flying off of you and your heavy breathing! You look so handsome no matter what you do — your very being is fanservice to people!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
Uh…Uh-huh…

<th>(This kid’s been watching me reaaally closely… Now I’m worried… I hope I wasn’t acting oddly back then…)</th>
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Aira %}
I’m so glad I got to see your basketball moves up close! And I get to go home with you, too! I’m super happy right now! Hehe~ I’m so glad I’m an idol…♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
Ah, yeah, you like idols… I’m guessing that you tell other idols how happy and glad you are, too.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Aira %}
Yup, you bet it! Every idol has something great about them, and I love each and every one of them~!

Like, you’ve got a slightly different feel to you depending on whether you’re in Ryuseitai-M or Ryuseitai-N.[^2]

Your expressions are a little softer when you’re in Ryuseitai-M, it’s sooo ra-vely~♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
D-Don’t talk about me… I’ll die from embarrassment…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Aira %}
Today was so fulfilling~♪ To be honest, I hadn’t been showing up to the club ‘cause I thought there was no point to it.

But I was wrong! I mean, I got to make precious memories with my seniors just today!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
Mmm… I dunno, I still think that it doesn’t really have much of a point to it.

It’s also been a while since I showed up, and it was honestly a pain… There were way too many people. I just had my energy drained…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Aira %}
Really? But you looked like you were really having fun playing with Morisawa-senpai.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
What… No way…
{% endbubble %}

{% img /img/es/idolstory/do_the_norm/4.jpg %}

{% bubble Chiaki %}
There you are, Takamine! You didn’t have to leave without me! That’s mean!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
Ugh, there he is…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Aira %}
It’s Morisawa-senpai~! Wow, it’s like, “speak of the devil” and stuff, huh? ♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki %}
Oh? You were talking about me?
{% endbubble %}

{% img /img/es/idolstory/do_the_norm/5.jpg %}

{% bubble Midori %}
No, um, we weren’t. Don’t worry about it…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki %}
Hmm? Well, alright. You two worked hard in the club today — are you feeling hungry?

Let’s eat at a cheap restaurant before we head home! It’ll be my treat, since I’m a former club member…☆
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Aira %}
Yaaay! ♪ I wanna go, I wanna go~!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
You just butt yourself in this conversation like it’s normal… Why’re all three of us going back together now…?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Aira %}
C’mon, Takamine-senpai, let’s gooo~!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki %}
What’s wrong, Takamine? I’ll carry you on my back if you’re tired!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
Ughh, Shiratori-kun, don’t drag me with you… And Morisawa-senpai, you’re just as tired as I am, so quit overdoing it already…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Aira %}
<th>(Going around places before heading home is the perfect way to enjoy my school life~! So ra-vely!)</th>

<th>(Not to mention, how super duper rare it is to see Takamine-senpai in his school uniform next to Morisawa-senpai! Hehehe~ I made another wonderful memory to remember~♪)</th>

## Translation Notes
[^1]: Aira is roommates with Rei and Eichi post-main story, so that might be the reason why.

[^2]: Ryuseitai-M = Morisawa, the unit under StarPro. Ryuseitai-N = Nagumo, the unit within Yumenosaki.
