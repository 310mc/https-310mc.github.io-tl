## Chapter 1

{% note narration %}
**Chapter TL Note:** The chapter title “birthplace of stars” is written in hiragana only, so I’ve written the title in lowercase letters, similar to how Kanata’s speech quirk (speaks in hiragana only) is written in my translations.

<div class="msr-narration">
    <p>Next day. Okinawa mainland, at the ES Okinawa branch…</p>
</div>

{% bubble Tetora curious %}
Woah…

I-I did hear ‘bout it, but… There seriously <em>is</em> an ES-lookin’ building in Okinawa, huh.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori curious %}
There was also one in Australia, right…[^1] They really build these things like convenience stores, huh?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki smileexplain %}
From Tenshouin’s standpoint, I think that he wants to make idols into something as familiar as convenience stores are to the public.

The more familiar and convenient it is, the more people will come to accept it.

And once something is accepted and becomes the “norm”, it can’t crumble all that easily.

It’s exactly like how long ago, people had to go through the trouble of buying tickets to ride trains — but even when we hear stories about those past experiences, it’s still hard for us current generation to imagine what it was like.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora norsmile %}
That’s ‘cuz nowadays, almost everyone uses their phone, and if not that, then a Suica card instead.[^2]

We can barely picture what life was like when there were only physical tickets. It’d be even harder to imagine the times before that, when trains and automobiles didn’t exist at all.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki idle %}
Yeah. The reality before us is being repainted, and the past quietly being long forgotten.

In the same fashion, the era when ES and idol culture were not the “norm” will slowly become one with the past, and vanish into thin air.

That’s likely Tenshouin’s — ES’s goal.

Slowly, but surely… ES is corroding reality, this very world.

They’re invading every part of it.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora frown %}
ES’s morphing into an evil organization hasn’t stopped at all, huh.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki frown %}
It would’ve been much simpler if ES was merely an evil organization, though. We would’ve only needed to thwart their overly-ambitious goals.

However, to us idols who profit greatly the more ES flourishes, that’s entirely unfeasible.

If we deny ES, we’d be denying the very ground we need to stand — the very atmosphere we need in order to breathe.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki serious %}
We’re kept alive through the company. The only thing we’re likely able to do is rectify every mistake made by our “protective guardian” known as ES.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki norsmile2 %}
Fortunately, we aren’t the only ones who feel this way. We were able to unite at the SS stage through it.

I’ve heard that Anzu has also partially separated herself from ES and is working independently now.

Let’s watch over these buds of hope so that they don’t get trampled, while doing what we can, one step at a time.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki smileexplain %}
“The black flame is the mark of effort” isn’t only your catchphrase, Nagumo.

It was by burning our nestled spirits together that every single color — every single flame became one.

That’s who we are now — the reborn Ryuseitai.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora smile %}
Ossu. Even if the color of the flame looks different each time we switch commanders, it’s actually the same flame all along. I’ll burn that flame bright, and let it light up the dark world.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori curious %}
…Lately, Morisawa-senpai and Tetora-kun have been strangely getting along, haven’t they?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shinobu smile %}
Not simply just getting along; it seems as though they’re talking on an equal footing with each other. As if they both see the same thing.

Fufu. Maybe there’s a small gap between the two of us and Tetora-kun now, don’t you think?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori nod %}
I don’t mind anything, as long as it means that I don’t look like I’m the only one falling behind… Shinobu-kun’s the only one who needs to stay in the same place as me forever…♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shinobu shocked %}
I-I’d also like to become stronger and grow wonderfully, you know!?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata smilesoft %}
okay now, your attention please~♪

i am sorry that i kept you all [waiting]. i have finally finished [preparing] everything, so let’s [depart].
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki curious %}
Preparing? Wait, Kanata, what’s that stuffed toy…? It seems to be slightly moving about…?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata grin %}
this is the turtle [kamegorou]’s relative, [turtlellius iii]~♪[^3]
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora awkward0 %}
Why does it sound like a Roman emperor name… —Wait, the name is the last thing I wanna ask ‘bout right now.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata smileexplain %}
yes. this is actually a [mascot costume], and kona-chan is inside it.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki idle %}
“Kona-chan”… You mean the head of Hoshijima, Minase Konata-kun?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata smileconfident %}
yes. he had [withdrawn] from society for a long time, so he is a little [afraid] of [strangers], so to speak…

it seems he does not want to be in the presence of the [public], so i am hiding him.

but. since kona-chan said that he [wants] to learn more about [idols]…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki norsmile %}
That’s why we decided to show him around ES, the headquarters of the cutting-edge idol movement, right? Seeing is believing, as they say.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata norsmile %}
yes. i thought that if he sees the [building], he will be able to understand the current way [idols] are [treated] in this age—

in other words, its [current state] would become [clear] to him.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora northinking %}
Makes sense, ‘cuz in reality, society’s understanding of idols is bein’ rapidly repainted thanks to ES. The way idols were seen in the past isn’t relevant anymore.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori sighdrop %}
Yeah, it’s rough just keeping up… I don’t think I’m keeping up at all, actually.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki norsmile %}
Yeah. The only thing we can do is ensure we stand our ground so that we don’t get thrown off.

In any case, we wanted to have a discussion with <em>fine</em> either way, as they’ve been up to something in Okinawa just like us.

At the very least, I’d like to exchange information and align our steps with them. They’re ES idols in the same agency as us — we should be able to unite forces.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori norsmile %}
That’s true… It seems that Morisawa-senpai is close with Tenshouin-senpai, Shinkai-senpai with Hibiki-senpai, and there’s Shinobu-kun who’s got ties with Himemiya-kun at the Student Council, so they’re close to some extent too.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori smilesoft %}
Meanwhile, Master Artist Fushimi and I love each other under the most ideal artist-fan relationship, so surprisingly, we could get along with <em>fine</em> pretty well, right…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shinobu awkward %}
I believe there can be several theories for the last one, though.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora smileconfident %}
Heheh. We were enemies with <em>fine</em> at first, but as times change, so do relationships, huh?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata norsmile %}
yes. i personally do not want to be on good terms with mr. [emperor] much, but—

i will put aside those [personal] feelings of mine for now.

we should not carry [personal feelings] like that in our work. isn’t that right?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki smile %}
Yeah. We need to focus all our energy on our task to restore Hoshijima. To be honest, I feel that this request is far too much for us to handle, but…

I assume that Tenshouin can see the “full picture”, more than any of us. So I expect that by talking to him, we’ll be able to find the clue to crack this case.
{% endbubble %}

## Chapter 2

{% img /img/es/eventstory/stellamaris/p2_2.jpg %}

<div class="msr-narration">
    <p>Several minutes later. In the ES Okinawa branch, the reception office…</p>
</div>

{% bubble Eichi frown %}
—I was hoping I wouldn’t have to see your faces even in Okinawa.

How unbearable… Could you leave at once?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki surprised0 %}
W-Why, Tenshouin!? Do you hate me!?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Eichi frown2 %}
Well, if I had the choice between “like” and “dislike”, I’d choose the latter… And as it gets hotter here, I think I’ll grow to despise you even more.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tori scold %}
Yeah, you’re <em>so</em> suffocating! Get outta Okinawa right this instant, you human heater!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shinobu norsmile %}
Now, now… Don’t get so agitated, Tori-kun. It’ll make the room feel unnecessarily hotter, and you only lose out by being so aggressive with others over everything, you know?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tori sightired %}
Mm~… Yeah, I know.

Sorry. Our project’s not really going so well, so I guess I was a little on edge.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki serious %}
The project isn’t going well? That can’t be true, can it? I mean, you’ve built some kind of ES branch on the mainland—
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Eichi frown %}
Anyone can do this much, you know. All you have to do is buy the land and hire construction workers.

However, our final objective is to take control over Hoshijima — the land that was once confined away from the idol industry for a long time.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tori surprised %}
Hiyah!? W-What? Is it just me, or did that plushie just move?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata smilesoft %}
that is just your imagination~ there is no way a [stuffed toy] can move, right?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tori serious %}
Mm… Anyway, Eichi-sama’s kinda expressing it in poor taste as always, but basically this whole procedure has an extremely ceremonious factor to it.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori curious %}
Mm? Mmm…? It’s hard to understand what you’re saying when you use such complicated words…?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Eichi %}
Ah, you see, Tori sometimes talks about difficult topics he hears from me without properly digesting it first. Although, it’s adorably charming in its own right, like a child imitating how his parent talks.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tori awkward %}
Mm… Um, so, to put it in easier terms…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tori serious %}
I dunno if you guys from Ryuseitai know this, but — It’s said that this industry has been controlled by a super distinguished, god-like figure for the looongest time.

That person’s time was far back in the past, but his influence has stuck around all the way until recently—
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki northinking %}
Ahh, is this about that, uh, “Godfather” was it?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Eichi serious %}
Yes. It probably sounds like a fairytale, but it’s an essential story to know — His influence affects us of this current era, as well.

There was once a God in this world.

However, that God died. And now, we are merely cutting up the debris of his legacy together, just barely scraping by with that food.

Or rather… Until ES was established, that was the wretched state we had been in.

But times have changed, and so has our trajectory. As time progressed and the change of generations repeated, God’s influential power began to slowly decrease in due time.

The conquest for Hoshijima is a crucial event to mark the symbol of that shift.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tori surprised %}
Hiyah!? T-The plushie moved again!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Eichi smile %}
…In fact. Apparently, the very person who made Hoshijima into a confined land, and never allowed any idol culture to come in contact with it is that God in question.

It’s unclear why he had made that decision. But the daydreaming folks believe there could possibly be hidden treasure left behind in Hoshijima by that God—

And so, they keep talking about such nonsense. Fufu.

Perhaps if I obtained that hidden treasure, my idol industry would develop in abundance, don’t you think?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki idle %}
The idol industry isn’t your personal property, though… But, well, I understand what you’re trying to say.

I was wondering why ES would go through so much effort to put their hands on an isolated island nobody knows about, that isn’t even on a map…

But I see now. By boldly breaking a taboo set by that so-called God, they prove themselves worthy.

“We are no longer under the control of God.”

“We are free.”

These series of events have all been for the ceremony where ES can finally assert these statements.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Eichi %}
You may look like an idiot, Chiaki, but your comprehension skills are as impressive as ever. I can see reading all those books long ago have taken you far.

Indeed, nobody is seeking practical benefits through this project. What’s important here is to tear down the regulation that God had established.

Once we’ve successfully accomplished this objective, we’ll stand proud as an independent body. We’ll be able to declare boldly:

“We’ve freed ourselves from the restraints of God. We, ES, are now the supreme ruler of this world.”

“We are now the new ruler of the idol industry.” — yes?
{% endbubble %}

## Chapter 3

{% bubble Chiaki srsthinking %}
Mm~… I feel as though you’re using far too much money for a mere ceremony… But well, if it’s you, Tenshouin, you’d probably be able to make profit from even a trivial event.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Eichi %}
I’m not making that many assertive moves this time, actually. Those tales of God couldn’t matter any less to me.

That’s why, since this boy here also wanted it this way — I’ve entrusted everything to do with this project to Tori.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tori sad2 %}
Mhm… But as I mentioned earlier, it’s not going really well so far, and it’s making me feel pathetic.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Eichi %}
It’s normal for there to be disputes during a land’s development project. We’re trespassing onto other people’s territory, after all. It’s only natural that the “native people” would oppose it.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki idle %}
Is that what happened? We also came into contact with the residents after a number of events, but they were trying to open up the closed Hoshijima to the outside world…?

At the very least, they didn’t show any opposition towards us. Surely this would mean that they also want that ruins-filled island to be restored.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Eichi serious %}
Are you sure that’s really true?

I don’t know who you met and what you talked about, but I don’t see how it’s possible for there to be absolutely no opposition whatsoever.

As a matter of fact, the model of the amusement park we had built at the end of last year in Hoshijima, the ATLANTIS[^4] — It was recently destroyed by someone.

Along with a threat to never dare touch their land again.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shinobu worried %}
What…? I never knew that such an extreme incident had occurred.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori srsthinking %}
Yeah… It was super peaceful… At least, where we were—
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Eichi yare %}
Well, it isn’t so grave that it needs to be reported. We had only temporarily built the entrance’s vicinity for ATLANTIS, and there were no actual injuries.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tori frown %}
But still, because of that incident, the construction workers we hired got freaked out, and the ATLANTIS construction project has been put to a stop for now.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tori smilesoft %}
That’s exactly why I’m expecting a lot from you, Ryuseitai.

I don’t know why exactly, but the Hoshijima residents have accepted you, right? I heard something like that from Shinobu.

In that case, that means you can also talk it out with the residents. Clear the doubts in their hearts, okay? In the friendly, over-familiar way you guys are known for.

Until you hear out the locals here, understand their feelings, and acknowledge them—

I can’t afford to carry on with the ATLANTIS construction project from my side.

Because even if we bulldozed through this with the power of authority and money, it’d only increase the chances of making grudges and ruining the project down the line, right?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Eichi awkward %}
That stings to hear. It’s easier that way, though, so I can’t help but choose that method almost every time… It settles everything much quicker, too.

However, Tori seems to prefer not choosing such a violent method.

It’s quite a naive, idealistic mindset, but — This project is centered around Tori, so his wishes will be prioritized above all.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Eichi serious %}
All that being said, I don’t want to waste time on a task as relatively trivial as that forever, so if I come to the conclusion that this is far too much for your unit and for Tori — I will intervene.

Even if it means transforming that peaceful island into hell, I <em>will</em> accomplish our goal.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Eichi smile %}
If that sounds detestable to you, then it’s time to brace yourselves and take on this challenge with all your might.

Despite everything, I’m expecting a lot from you Ryuseitai.
{% endbubble %}

{% img /img/es/eventstory/stellamaris/p2_3.jpg %}

<div class="msr-narration">
    <p>Around an hour later. At a restaurant near the ES Okinawa branch building…</p>
</div>

{% bubble Chiaki srsthinking %}
……………
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mizusaba %}
Ah— Welcome baaack~♪

That was surprisingly fast\~? What’s up? Did you forget something\~?

Or are you just here to eat now that it’s lunchtime?

Then I’ll cook you the best meal yet~. Truth be told, I’m usually working here as a chef—
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki v2 %}
Ahh, we would love that. We need to first nourish ourselves and get our blood pumping in our heads.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata smileexplain %}
fufu. we had to listen to a [good-for-nothing] talk, so we decided to first [organize] our thoughts.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori sighfrown %}
Yeah… After that conversation, it wasn’t really the right mood to show Konata-kun the cutting-edge of idol culture anymore…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mizusaba %}
Hmm\~. That’s too bad\~? Wasn’t Konata-sama really looking forward to that\~?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Konata frownshake %}
Please don’t pat my head. When you do it, I get terrified by the thought of being flattened.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mizusaba %}
Oh\~? Konata-sama is so tiny and cute, though\~? I could gobble you up in one bite\~♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Konata horrified %}
…………
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata awkward %}
please do not frighten my [little brother] so much, mizusaba-san.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mizusaba %}
I didn’t mean to do that at all, though\~. Sorry, okay? It’s just a joke, really\~?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Konata frown %}
No, I’m aware you mean no harm. As someone from the mainland, you have no obligation to be concerned with our affairs…

Yet here you are, involving yourself— No, <em>cooperating</em> with us. It’s unthinkable that I’d ever see that as a burden, when I should be showing you gratitude.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mizusaba %}
No need to be so reserved\~ Aren’t we neighbors? We should help each other out when we’re in trouble\~♪
{% endbubble %}

## Chapter 4

{% bubble Kanata curious %}
erm… i wanted to ask, mizusaba-san. what sort of [relationship] do you have with my [little brother]? you seem to be on [close terms]…?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mizusaba %}
Mm? Mm~, friends, I guess?

Ever since my grandpa’s back got worse, I’ve taken on the job of transporting supplies to Hoshijima~.

That’s part of why I’m the one taking care of you folks, because I’m kinda the one responsible for Hoshijima nowadays~.

So every time I’d ship supplies to the island, Konata-sama would ask me about the outside world, and I’d tell him all about it~.

He’d listen with so much interest\~, so that might’ve made him get attached to me? But that’s okay with me; it doesn’t feel so bad to be liked by such an adorable being\~♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata nod %}
hm, hm. so, similar to what [mikejima] was to me in the past? it is hard <em>not</em> to really [like] someone like that, yes?[^5]
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata norsmile %}
but, if that is the case… then please make sure to take [responsibility] — do not abandon kona-chan until the [very end], okay?

please make sure to get along with kona-chan forever.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mizusaba %}
Mhm? Mhm… Well, I already intend to do that~?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Konata glare %}
Please don’t spout unnecessary things to him, Kanata-sama.

There is no need to pay any attention to what this person is saying, okay, Mizusaba-san?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mizusaba %}
Mm\~. But It sounded like he was serious, so I’ll also take it seriously, yeah\~?

We don’t know what’ll happen in the future, but… I really hope we can get along forever~. Not just Konata-sama and I, but everyone in the world, too.

…Woops! Almost left the pot cooking on its own~. Can’t have a fire happening here.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata awkward %}
ah— i am so sorry, i got too deep into our conversation.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mizusaba %}
No worries at all~. Stuff like this gets harder to say if you lose your chance to say it.

It’s best to talk about important matters as soon as possible, rather than later~… No matter what.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata curious %}
……?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki idle %}
Kanata. You can’t keep carrying Konata-kun in your arms, could you let him sit on a seat?

I know Okinawans aren’t bothered by trivial things, but it’s still garnering attention on us.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata norsmile %}
ahh, kona-chan is wearing these [clothes], after all~ he will naturally stand out.
{% endbubble %}

{% img /img/es/eventstory/stellamaris/p2_4.jpg %}

{% bubble Konata curious %}
…Is my attire strange? Now that you mention it, my attire isn’t different from Mizusaba-san alone — It’s quite different from people outside the island in general, isn’t it?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata grin %}
yes. fufu, onii-chan will buy you the [latest fashion] once it is time to go home. i will make you even cuter~♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Konata hmphright %}
I am fine with not being cute, so I do not need it.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Konata %}
More importantly, what are your thoughts on what was discussed earlier, everyone?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki idle %}
Hm… Thanks to Tenshouin and Himemiya, I’ve gotten a better grasp of the whole picture, but there are a couple of things I don’t understand.

First — who was the person that interfered with the construction of the amusement park ATLANTIS, and caused it to come to a halt?

I don’t want to treat them as the culprits… However, that island is closed off, and it’s hard for ordinary people to enter it. We can assume that a resident who is against the construction might have been the one who had caused harm—
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Konata sad %}
……………
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora northinking %}
Yeah, it’s hard to think up other possible suspects, after all. There would’ve been construction workers at the time of the incident, but I don’t see why they’d ruin their own hard work.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki serious %}
No, I’m suspicious of that line of thought, as well.

This case can be assumed to be an outrageous act that overturns previous conventions.

For example, there’s also the possibility that a devotee of that so-called God sabotaged their work out of anger, thinking “how dare you all defy God’s wishes!”
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shinobu serious %}
So there is even the possibility that a saboteur…? of some sort? blended in with the group of workers. I see…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki idle %}
<em>fine</em> are the ones responsible for the construction work, so they’re surely looking into that possibility already. It’s a matter of grave concern, so I’ll ask Tenshouin about it again later.

I can’t help but feel like there’s something suspicious about this from an overall perspective, but that still doesn’t mean we should suspect the island’s residents at random.

Though you’ll typically find a scene where the locals vehemently protest against the development of a land in movies…

We can’t allow that sort of expectation and general opinion to cloud our judgement.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shinobu idle %}
Mm… It really is as Morisawa-dono says.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori curious %}
M-Morisawa-senpai looks oddly reliable… Even though he’s just Morisawa-senpai…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki smug %}
I’m a guy you can always rely on! But of course, this job is focused around Kanata, our commander — so I’m trying not to meddle too much!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata smileconfident %}
no, no. you are just the [right person] for the [job]. we can achieve so much by covering for each other’s [shortcomings], yes?

as long as we do that, we will never lose to anyone.

the same goes for [this case]… we will [solve] it spectacularly — i am absolutely certain of it.
{% endbubble %}

## Chapter 5

<div class="msr-narration">
    <p>Several minutes later…</p>
</div>

{% bubble Chiaki smileconfident %}
Even fishies are alive~♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora nod %}
In the water’s where we thrive~♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori norsmile %}
But we’re delicious!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shinobu fist %}
Eat us\~♪ Eat us\~♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata grin %}
we want you\~ to\~ eat\~ us\~…♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Konata %}
…………

…I see. This is what you call…… idols.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata niyaclosed %}
……♪ *<th>(making an extremely smug expression)</th>*
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori sighdrop %}
*<th>(whispering)</th>* Hey, can I ask…? How did we get ourselves into this ridiculously goofy situation…?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora serious %}
*<th>(whispering)</th>* Since we’re still digestin’ our meals, we figured we’d show Konata-kun an idol performance while we can.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki frown %}
*<th>(whispering)</th>* Yeah. All he’s been doing is listening to complicated discussions; we hadn’t been able to show Konata-kun what he actually wanted to see.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shinobu worried %}
*<th>(whispering)</th>* But are we sure that <em>this</em> is what we should show Konata-dono? Will it be alright…? Surely he’ll be dumbfounded—
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Konata smileconfident %}
……♪

It’s amazing. How interesting. I was quite moved.

Idols… refer to amusing and interesting people, is that right?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata nod %}
yes.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki shocked %}
Yes, but also no!? Just to make this clear, idols are a different type of occupation from comedians!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora smileconfident %}
Ahaha, there are some cases when idols behave that way, though~♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Konata norsmile %}
I see. Um, perhaps my understanding is lacking, but…

In short, are idols a job where you entertain others?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mizusaba %}
Nyahaha! Nyahahaha! ☆ That was awesome~! The way you wiggled your hips really looked like a fish!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Konata norsmile %}
…And perhaps they’re people who can make others smile and laugh, just like this?

If that is the case, then I, at the very least, would like to accept that.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Konata frown %}
On our island, Hoshijima… Time has stopped. Long long ago, it had been cursed by a preposterous figure that you referred to as God—

And eventually froze until it was unable to move any longer. Now, it’s a land akin to a corpse.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Konata smilesoft2 %}
If you can revive it — If you can make it shine the same way that you are shining right now… Then it can’t be wrong to choose to do so.

It must surely be the right thing to do. Correct?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata norsmile %}
yes.

that is [absolutely] a form of [justice].
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Konata norsmile %}
Is that so… Then I — <em>We</em> will do everything in our power to actualize a bright future.

No, in fact, it’s for that reason that I relied on this faint line of fate, and sought for all of your help.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata smilesoft %}
i would love to help you, of course… but we will not be able to do anything if we do not [know] the full story, so could you please [explain] a little bit more to us?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Konata srsthinking %}
Yes, of course. But where should I start…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Konata %}
My hometown, Hoshijima—

It can be said that it was an island true to its name, star island — A land where meteorites had often rained down since ancient times.

It is also said that the very structure of the island had been formed by meteorites constantly falling onto the seabed until a part of it was uplifted to the surface.

Thus known as “Hoshijima”, the island where stars fall.

It’s because it has such an intricate history that the worshippers from Kanata-sama’s religion — who fled to faraway lands — saw this island as a place to call home… as his religion also has deep connections to meteorites.

And so, it seems that they chose this place to settle in.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shinobu curious %}
The religion from Shinkai-dono’s household has to do with meteorites?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata smileexplain %}
yes~ we [purify] the [evil things] that were assumed to have spilled out from the [meteorite], and heal those who become [ill] from it.

we were [used] for those acts, and so eventually became worshipped as [gods] for it. that was how it all [began].[^6]

there are several [theories] to it, though~ it is a [pretty old] story, and it has not been [recorded] in any actual [texts].
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata frown %}
it is also because i do not [remember] things all that well, but… even if it was [recorded] somewhere, i was not in a position where i could [examine] such texts.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora curious %}
Huh? But Shinkai-senpai was the highest big-shot in the religion — or well, the god of worship, right?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata norsmile %}
yes. i was a [god], not a [human].

there is a large, [definitive gap] between those two existences.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki idle %}
Hm… I see how the worshippers of the tentatively named Kanata Religion migrated to the island. I believe they sensed a similar scent in Hoshijima to their hometown.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora srsthinking %}
But why did they even run away to Okinawa in the first place?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata frown %}
that, i do not know~ that is also a story from [long past]. but rather than ran away, it seems like they had a [dispute] and [broke off].

it seems that, the people who [migrated] to [okinawa] were much more [devoted] to the [religion] than the people of my [area].

in fact, compared to the people of my [area], whose [faith] slowly faded as [history] went on—

you could say that the [okinawan] people were the ones who stayed [devoted] as [pure], genuine [worshippers].
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata serious %}
of course, there are much more [people] in the [main house], and they had [thrived] just fine, but…

i do not know who was in the [right] as [worshippers] — the ones who left, or the ones who stayed.

in my [area], they [look down] on those people for their [heresy], but…

who could really say which are the [true worshippers] between the two?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori idle %}
I don’t really know much about religion, but… From Konata-kun’s standpoint, I’m guessing he’d wanna stop living a lifestyle so heavily absorbed by religion?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Konata worried %}
Eh— E-Erm… Why would you think that? Midori-sama?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori frownshake %}
Don’t call me by “-sama”… Master Artist calls me by that too, but I’m nobody all that important…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Konata %}
However, I must show respect to my elders.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki grin2 %}
How admirable! Takamine, you should learn from him! I want you to show me more respect!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori v2 %}
When have you <em>ever</em> done something respectable, huh?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori idle %}
…Anyway, um, I don’t really understand complicated topics, but…

I was just thinking that if I were in Konata-kun’s shoes, I feel like I’d hate that sorta lifestyle…

Even though we’re still lacking in practice, you were super happy just from listening to our song…

But the thing is, there’s a lot of stuff way more interesting than that in this world… Yet you reacted to our song like it was the first time you’d experienced something like this.

Doesn’t that mean there isn’t a single bit of entertainment like that on that island?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori sad2 %}
I’d <em>hate</em> that… No entertainment, no convenience stores… Konata-kun’s still so small, yet you even have to talk like an adult…

If I had to live in an environment like that, I already know I wouldn’t be able to handle it.

Just imagining it makes me depressed…
{% endbubble %}

## Chapter 6

{% bubble Konata smileconfident %}
Fufu. Midori-sama is extremely perceptive, isn’t he?

How incredible… You truly understand how I feel.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki nod %}
Of course he would! Takamine is *incredible!* He’s a perceptive boy who can sense and understand all the subtleties within someone’s delicate heart!

I have to thank you! For appreciating Takamine’s wonderful trait…!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori v2 %}
Why are <em>you</em> so proud of that.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki grin2 %}
*I’m* the one who raised Takamine!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Konata norsmile %}
Fufu. Okay, if you enjoyed that, then I’ll gladly compliment some more.

Thank you very much. Because of Midori-sama, it became easier for me to bring up the actual topic at hand.

I had been too embarrassed to say anything up until now, and thus feigned disinterest… But the truth is, after hearing so many tales of the outside from Mizusaba-san, I became extremely captivated by it.

I would daydream of how wonderful and dazzling the world must surely be outside of the island.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori frown %}
There’s really not that many great things lying around outside the island, though.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki scold %}
Hey now! Don’t interrupt the conversation with unpleasant comments! Now you’re showing your bad trait, Takamine!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori sideeye %}
Hmph, <em>so</em> sorry for being negative…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Konata smile %}
Fufu. But of course, I’m not a child anymore. I’m ten years old by now, so I haven’t been thinking of childish things such as expecting a paradise to exist outside the island.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora frown %}
A ten year old is <em>still</em> a kid, y’know…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shinobu awkward %}
Right… I was still a dumb child at that age, just playing pretend as a ninja.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora nod %}
That side of Shinobu-kun hasn’t changed at all since then, in a good way, huh?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shinobu worried %}
Wait, no— Right now I don’t pretend to be one; I do it as a *job!*
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Konata norsmile %}
Yes. From my perspective, the things that appear to be like fun playtimes—

Those things that seem to be extremely interesting and amusing… Everyone does it as a job, correct? Thus, you earn money, and secure yourself nourishment for your everyday life.

I am very envious of that.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Konata sad3 %}
I would like to live similarly to all of you, as well. I don’t want to simply survive, but to also spend my days enjoying myself.

Is it wrong to wish for something like that?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata norsmile %}
no, not one bit.

your [dream] should never be [invalidated].
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki smileconfident %}
It’s as Kanata says. You aren’t in the wrong at all, Konata-kun.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora smilesoft %}
Ossu. We’re shooting stars.[^7] It’s our duty to make dreams come true.

That dream of yours deserves to be acknowledged. And we’d like you to let us help make that dream into a reality, Konata-kun.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Konata smilesoft2 %}
Thank you very much. That makes me ever so happy.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Konata frownshake %}
However, there lies many problems in reality.

Chiaki-sama advocated for us, but — It’s likely that the ones who interfered with the amusement park’s construction are some of us islanders.

We are no monolith by any means.

Generally, the only ones who truly want to open the island to the outside world is “Mother” and I—
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata norsmile %}
is mother doing well?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Konata norsmile %}
Eh? Yes, as you know, after living under such harsh conditions for half her life, she’s been in an awfully unstable, ambiguous mental state… Well, she’s been like that for a long time.

Her physical health is perfectly fine, however. She always treats me so kindly.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata smile %}
is that so… then i am glad to hear that.

i was [worried] for you at first, you know. kona-chan [dresses] exactly how i used to in the past—

so i was worried that you were being treated as a [god].
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Konata worried %}
Ah, no, I wear this because I want to. When I’m in this attire, everyone around me treats me kindly, perhaps out of memory of their god… They give me snacks, as well. D-Does it look strange?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata nod2 %}
no, no. if you are wearing it because you want to, then it means it is quite [stylish] on you~♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Konata smileexplain %}
Hah… Erm, anyway. As for the other residents of the island — We have been depopulating, and most of the people living here are elderly at this point, but — They wish to maintain the status quo.

They’d like to remain in their current lifestyle of living blissfully without doing anything, and blessed with money from a contract of the past.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori srsthinking %}
If I just heard about that part, I think I’d also agree that it sucks to suddenly be told to work after living without needing to for a long time… If I could, I’d also wanna live my life doing whatever without moving a muscle…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Konata serious %}
Yes. I understand how you feel, as well.

However… The distinguished-looking person said this earlier as well, but — Times have changed.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki smile %}
Distinguished-looking person…♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Konata curious %}
Eh— Um, I do not know his name, so…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki norsmile %}
Yeah, of course. We should’ve introduced him to you properly. We’re well-acquainted with him, so we neglected to do so, but — His group will likely continue to be involved in this case…

Or rather, they’re also in a position to control the fate of the island, so.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Konata %}
Yes. They mentioned this as well, but… Times have changed, and so the curse — the mystical barrier placed on the island has started to crumble.

The influence of that figure who protected the island and hid it from the world is slowly dwindling…

And eventually, the tradition of ceaselessly distributing supplies will come to a stop, as well.

That future will inevitably appear before us. In fact, it could happen this very second.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki serious %}
Mm. Unfortunately, that’s what is called the “big wave” of history.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Konata %}
However. Once that happens, we will inevitably dry up, as we don’t know how to provide for ourselves. If a caretaker stopped providing food for his livestock, they would simply starve to death.

I would like to change our situation before that happens.

We need to arrange a foundation where we can support ourselves from hereon.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Konata frown %}
Nothing will come out of hindering the amusement park’s construction. It will barely even buy us time.

We must learn how to prepare ourselves for the inevitable future, and learn to survive.

Am I wrong in any way?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata smilesoft2 %}
not at all.

you were raised to be such a splendid, [good boy], kona-chan.

it makes me happy. it feels like [proof] that mother raised you with so much [love] in her heart.

although, it could also be because the worshippers obeyed mother’s [wishes], as she was once a [god] before—

and [raised] you as [best] as they could.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Konata norsmile %}
Yes. While they and I may not share the same opinion in this matter, the worshippers — the islanders are all kind to me on a general basis.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Konata %}
That is exactly why I want to avoid the impending fate of doom for the islanders.

For that purpose, please lend me your strength and wisdom, Ryuseitai.

If there is anything that I can do, I will gladly do so.

So please, I beg you — Please save us.
{% endbubble %}

## Chapter 7

{% img /img/es/eventstory/stellamaris/p2_7.jpg %}

<div class="msr-narration">
    <p>That night. At a beach near the ES Okinawa branch…</p>
</div>

{% bubble Eichi smile %}
—Hello there, Chiaki.

Fufu. Meeting each other in secret on a beach at night makes me feel like we’re doing something unthinkable, don’t you agree?

Why, Shinkai-kun might get angry at you for being a cheater.
{% endbubble %}

{% img /img/es/eventstory/stellamaris/chiakiorigcg.jpg %}

{% bubble Chiaki stellaocg %}
Kanata wouldn’t get angry over something like that. That aside, the ocean breeze isn’t too good for your health, is it? Let’s make this discussion brief.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Eichi smile %}
Your thoughtfulness is appreciated. Sorry, I simply can’t set aside the suspicion that ES could be spying on us if we spoke through HoldHands.

So we have no choice but to talk about important matters face-to-face. Somewhere outside of ES, where there are no surveillance cameras.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki stellaocg %}
Thank you; you’re always helping me out.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Eichi %}
That feeling is mutual, “Ally of justice”-kun.

In any case, about your inquiry — Actually, our investigation has led us to find that it was a group of Hoshijima residents that interfered with the amusement park’s construction.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki frown %}
Ahh, so that’s where the bad prediction came true, huh…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Eichi serious %}
Mm. Still, this may make things a little more complicated, but… It’s possible that there is a mastermind who incited the islanders to commit such an outrageous act.

That’s exactly why we’re letting the culprits go scot-free without arresting them. It’s to lure out the mastermind behind the incident and identify who they are.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki serious %}
Mastermind…?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Eichi yare %}
Why are you looking at me with so much distrust? If I were the mastermind, do you really think I would so stupidly and honestly tell you that one exists?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki idle %}
On the contrary, it’s possible you intentionally told me the truth so that I would think that way.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Eichi frown %}
It makes me sad to know even <em>you</em> would suspect me. I truly do mean it when I say this.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Eichi serious %}
However. I don’t know if you can believe my words, but… It really has nothing to do with me this time.

I’ve left all the handling of the amusement park ATLANTIS to Tori, after all.

Even I wouldn’t behave in a way that would pointlessly distress that adorable boy.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki smilesoft %}
Well, I’ll trust you on that. You’re capable of utilizing anything when it comes to attaining your goals, no matter who’s involved—

But objectively speaking, there’s no point in interfering with the park’s construction and the island’s restoration. You gain nothing out of it.

That’s why you aren’t the culprit. You aren’t the mastermind pulling the strings from behind.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Eichi smile %}
Thank you. If only everyone would consider everything logically like you do. People believe far too much in tales of the occult, like intuition, sixth sense, or even spirits, don’t you think?

It’s truly laughable how many people fall for religions like that.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Eichi awkward %}
In any case — Ah, that was the second time now. I should refrain from saying that. Recently, Yuzuru started to meaninglessly count each time I say “in any case”, so I can’t help but pay mind to that.[^8]
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki yare %}
Everyone has their favorite phrase to say, don’t they? Those who ridicule that are the ones who are vulgar.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Eichi %}
Mm. Right, as for the other inquiry—

You asked me why Hoshijima was a confined land, yes?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki idle %}
Yeah. We’re going to intervene in the inner workings of the island, and bring about change from within. For that reason, it’s essential that we know what sort of history Hoshijima has first.

I doubt the islanders would want to have everything repainted by outsiders who barely understand anything about them.

So first, I’d like to thoroughly learn everything there is to know about Hoshijima and its islanders.

Even if I reach out my hand to try and save them — if my eyes are closed, I’d only needlessly hurt the other party.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Eichi %}
It’s just like you to think that way, Chiaki, but I’m a bit surprised.

Personally, I thought you were going to ask me who Minase Konata, Hoshijima’s leader, was, and what relationship he has with Shinkai-kun.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki idle %}
It’s probably a complicated familial situation.

I’m not part of Kanata’s family. I have no right to delve deep into those matters.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Eichi norsmile %}
I think Shinkai-kun would be sad if he heard that. But I digress; this doesn’t really have anything to do with the matter at hand.

To be fair, even I can barely grasp their family affairs. I wouldn’t have been able to answer that question anyway… So you’ve saved me the trouble by not asking it.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki smilesoft %}
Yeah, I figured. Just to let you know, though, I’m also immensely curious about it.

But Kanata always has such a gentle look on his face when speaking to Konata-kun. Surely that means their relationship is nothing to worry about.

Which is why there’s no need for me to intrude in any way. If Kanata is happy and satisfied, then that’s enough for me.
{% endbubble %}

## Chapter 8

{% bubble Eichi smile %}
Fufu. It’s fun having a chat with you, but it’s time we carry on with the main topic.

The reason Hoshijima was a confined land is because it was where God was born and raised — his hometown.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki serious %}
“Godfather”’s hometown, is it?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Eichi %}
Yes. By the way, I don’t know how much you know already, but “Godfather” had been substituted throughout his long period of activity.

In the end, in place of the God who disdained everything and went into retirement, it seems that a figure known as “Priest” took on his role.

Hoshijima is the hometown of the God that took over — The “Priest”.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki sighfrown %}
“Priest”… I heard he was subdued in SS, but his name still lingers, huh…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Eichi serious %}
That’s how mighty and powerful his existence was; even rotting won’t be enough to make him vanish. His last few days may have been miserable, but he was an influential figure who seized control over the entire industry.

When the Priest was still nothing but a loyal subject to God, God made his hometown prosper as a reward for his loyalty.

Due to that, and perhaps in contribution to being so near to the mainland, as well — Hoshijima received its first and last prosperity.

Those buildings across the island that became nothing but ruins — They were built during that time.

However, the very moment he stole the position of God by substituting for him, the Priest had a complete change in demeanor.

He tried to eradicate his own footsteps as thoroughly as possible, so that nobody could ever learn of his true identity.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki idle %}
I see. That’s why the Priest’s birthplace, Hoshijima, was erased even from maps, and turned into a confined land that nobody was allowed to be involved with—

Leading to its existence being hidden and entirely forgotten.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Eichi %}
And that brings us to today. Perhaps the Priest cherished his hometown, because the residents are provided the bare necessities without compensation to this day. That was also under the Priest’s suggestion, you see.

If he truly wanted to erase all traces of himself, he should’ve slaughtered all the residents and demolished the buildings until the island was reduced to an empty plot of land. That’s how he could <em>actually</em> erase this place from the world.

It would’ve been much simpler.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki frown %}
You say such terrifying things… I’m actually a little relieved to hear that. It’s almost as if even the Priest, who’s always seen as an ominous ghost, had a humane heart.

That he also had enough humanity in him to cherish his hometown.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Eichi yare %}
Although, I can’t really sympathize nor show compassion to those feelings, really. It only makes me wonder why he didn’t express such kindness to his biological children.[^9]

He wasn’t the one who went through the pains of giving birth to them, so perhaps he doesn’t think of them as part of him — and that’s why he couldn’t cherish and love them properly.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Eichi norsmile %}
Well, either way, I’ll utilize whatever I can. By overturning the Priest’s trivial fixations, we can make the era that God constructed come to an end.

We can prove that we’re free from God now, and proclaim it to the world. This is an absolutely necessary process to welcome the new age.

Once the curtains have closed on God’s era, the era of human beings will begin.

—Our era.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki norsmile %}
Mm… You in particular seem on the verge of detaching yourself from this world like a god, and it worries me… But this is your dream, isn’t it?

In that case, I’ll support you. You’re my friend, after all.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Eichi %}
Thank you. Then as repayment, what say I support your dream? As long as it doesn’t come in the way of my overly-ambitious dreams, of course.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki smilesoft %}
You won’t have to worry about that. I have a small favor to ask you, but—

I guarantee you that “it” will definitely not get in the way of your goals.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Eichi smile %}
Oh? I would’ve scoffed if anyone else said that to me, but for some strange reason, I can trust those words when it comes from you — Chiaki.

Fufu. How nostalgic. Didn’t we also huddle close and speak of our dreams back when we were children in the hospital?[^10]

Time had passed since then, and our innocent selves have changed so much that we no longer have any traces of our former selves—

But just look at us now. To this very day, the stars in the sky and our dreams are shining without a single stain on them.
{% endbubble %}

welcome back, chiaki.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki surprised %}
……!?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata worried %}
ah, i am sorry. did i surprise you?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki idle %}
You’re still awake, Kanata? Didn’t I say you could rest before me?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata smilesoft %}
if i fell asleep too, who would [open] the door for chiaki once he is back~?

we cannot keep the door [unlocked] now, can we?

even if this is a very [well-secured ryokan], there are [bad guys] everywhere.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki awkward %}
Ahh, yeah… I could’ve taken the key with me and unlocked the door by myself, but that means you guys wouldn’t have been able to leave while I’m gone.

I also didn’t want the kids to know I’d be taking a walk outside in the middle of the night.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata frown %}
right~ you are always pretending to be so [well-behaved]~

yet you forbid the [children] from going out, while you [play around] and enjoy a [nightlife] of your own. how cruel.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki worried %}
I-I wasn’t playing around either, though?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata norsmile %}
i know that~ thank you for your [hard work] as always, hero.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki idle %}
…Kanata.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata norsmile %}
yes? what is it, chiaki?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki frownshake %}
……— ……Never mind, it’s nothing.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata yare %}
what… now i am curious. if there is something you want to say, please say it clearly, okay?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata smilesoft %}
if it is chiaki, i will not get angry no matter what you say. i will show [mercy] in a [god]-like fashion, and [chop] you down in a composed manner.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki surprised0 %}
So you aren’t going to forgive me!?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata smileconfident %}
fufufu~ since when did you start to [delude] yourself into thinking [god] is kind?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki idle %}
I’ve said this many times before, but… You aren’t a god anymore, are you?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata smilesoft2 %}
yes. you were the one who made me [human], chiaki.[^11]

when i first [met] you—

there was nothing inside me. not a single thing except my [god] self.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki serious %}
……………
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata norsmile %}
at one point, there was a kind person, mikejima, who provided me with many things.

[tattered] and injured everywhere, he would carry those things all the way to me.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata frownshake %}
but. i had [forgotten] all of that at some point.

i forcibly [sealed] away all those warm [memories]—

and turned into a [dummy] who did not know nor understand anything.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata sad3 %}
but i had to. if i did not do so, mikejima would die.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki idle %}
……………
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata sighfrown %}
he broke the [rules] for my sake over and over again. he repeatedly committed many [sins] by breaking the [taboo].

all for me, for someone like *me.*

to be specific, they were deeds that were considered to be [sins] within my [religion]… to the ordinary person, those acts would not matter, but…

a [sin] is a [sin].
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata frown %}
mikejima was threatened to pay for [them] with his [life]. and he may have been [strong], but he was not [invincible].

that is why i [feigned] ignorance and [pretended] not to know him.

i did anything i could to keep him away from me. even the reason he was driven to a [far away country] was because i wanted it.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki idle %}
……………
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata sad %}
i claimed that i [loathed] him—

that i did not want to see his face anymore—

that i wanted him to stay far away from me—

i [insisted on] it over and over again, until i even made <em>myself</em> [believe] that it is true.
{% endbubble %}

## Chapter 10

{% bubble Kanata serious %}
and then—

there was not a single thing that surrounded the empty, hollow me anymore.

it was during that state that i [met] you, chiaki.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata norsmile %}
and then, it was you who provided that empty me—

with everything.

you were probably [unaware] of it… but you [reenacted] what were my [happiest memories] when i was a child—

with those [ceremonies], you recovered my [heart].

you brought back everything that i definitely had inside of me a long time ago.

things that were meant to be precious to me.
{% endbubble %}

{% img /img/es/eventstory/stellamaris/kanataorigcg.jpg %}

{% bubble Kanata stellaocg %}
after that, my [precious things] rapidly increased in number. a hundred, thousand times more than the amount i had when i was young.

honestly, i cannot even hold them all anymore at this point, chiaki.

thank you.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki norsmile %}
There’s no need to thank me.

I only did what is natural to do as a hero— No, as a human being.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki grin %}
It’s <em>me</em> who should say that to you, Kanata. Thank you for making me into the hero of my dreams.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata grin %}
yes. we are both grateful to each other, isn’t that right?

ahaha. it is so [late] to [discuss] all of this, huh~
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki smilesoft %}
You felt like talking about it now, didn’t you? And that’s fine by me, I’ll tag along.

You’ve been flowing along with whatever I wanted to do for so long, after all. It’s now my turn to do the same.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata norsmile %}
this is what <em>i</em> want to do as well, chiaki.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata frownshake %}
but i feel [anxious].

all my [life], i never did what i wanted to do. i beared with it, feigned ignorance, and kept everything at a distance—

that i no longer even know what i [love].

that is why. when i became the [commander] and was told to do what i like, i was [not really sure] what to do, to be honest.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata smilesoft2 %}
but you know, while i was [fooling about] with everyone in the same way we always do, i came to understand it.

you see, chiaki, i want to become a hero.[^12]

when i was young, the hero to me was mikejima.

then, as if by [fate], we encountered one another, and my hero became you.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata smileconfident %}
but. you wanted me to become a hero too, didn’t you? i still remember. i have not forgotten.

i will never forget ever again.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata smilesoft %}
we were a hero sentai of only two.

now we have more [members] in our squad, but… you had wanted that from me since that time, yes?

i know i am late to do this, but i will fulfill that desire of yours.

not because i am a [god], but because i am a [human being]. my [human] self wants to do this.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata norsmile %}
first, i will save kona-chan, who looks exactly like my young self. i will become that child’s hero.

with mikejima and chiaki as my [role models]—

i will make sure to save him, as much as i have been saved, at least.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata smile %}
i am not doing this because he is my [little brother]. it is because he is seeking [help] the [same] way my young self had.

so i, as a hero, will save that child.

that is what i want to do.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki idle %}
Um, I’m not sure if this is alright to ask, but about that boy — Is Konata-kun really your younger brother, Kanata?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata srsthinking %}
to tell you the truth, i am not sure at all~… there was news of my [mother] being in [okinawa], specifically in [hoshijima]—

which i had only vaguely [overheard] during the [ss qualifying round].

but i assume that since my [mother] had [nowhere] to go, not only was the [okinawan] group that [branched off] from the main house a good [hiding spot] for her—

but [hoshijima] itself as well, since it was a [confined land].
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata serious %}
so, once various things had [settled], i had a lot of things to [think over] recently—

and so, i tried to go and meet my [mother].

i had considered that [she] likely wanted to just be left alone, and did not even want to [see] me of all people—

even so, i wanted to have a [glance] at her while she is still alive.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata sighfrown %}
but… mother’s [mental state] had become so [ambiguous], that [she] could not even tell i was her [child]—

and that was when i saw him — kona-chan, next to [mother].

a mysterious [child] who looked exactly like my younger self.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata frown %}
i do not truly know what he is.

for a moment, i thought of something [silly], as if mother brought him to life with her [god] powers.

that perhaps she also missed her [child] so much that she brought about a [miracle].
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata idle %}
but of course, thinking about it with more sense — the fact that he has the [exact same] face as me means it is likely that my mother birthed a new [child] here.

but i do not know the [real truth]. the people of that [island] are from the same [religion] as me, so their [roots] are the same—

it is also possible that through very faint [blood] relations, we just so happened to have resembling [faces].

i will not know the [truth] until my [mother] comes back to her [senses].
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata smilesoft %}
but you know, i do not really care either way. i do not even mind if we are [complete strangers].

that child is asking for [help].

and so, i will do [whatever i can] to save him.

in the far future, maybe that child will then [save] someone else… that is how a person’s [kindness] is bound to be inherited from one to another.

that is the [beauty] of being a human being.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata smileconfident %}
you were the one who taught me that, chiaki. no, in fact, in order to [prove] that—

and in order to [flaunt] all the things i have [obtained] despite having once been an empty person, to show how amazing they are—

i will [transform] from here onwards.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata smilesoft2 %}
please do watch over me as my hero [senpai], chiaki. and if i manage to do it properly, then please praise me.

pat my head and say i did great, like you always would. ♪

oh? i do not see any real [response]… are you alright~? do you [understand] what we will be [doing] from here on out?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora awkward0 %}
Ossu, we’re good there. It’s just that Shinkai-senpai is unusually over-excited, so we were kinda surprised in a way.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori frown %}
Right…? We’ve got enough of that from Morisawa-senpai, y’know… I’d prefer it if Shinkai-senpai always stays as the healing presence, being floaty and taking it easy…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki grin2 %}
I thought it was absolutely wonderful, Kanata! You’re the commander this time, after all! You should have the vigor to lead everyone without hesitation!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shinobu v2 %}
I completely agree~! Today, Shinkai-dono— <em>No</em>, Shinkai *Taichou-dono* is as reliable as Morisawa-dono during our Yumenosaki days, or perhaps even more than that…☆
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori sightired %}
Well, looks like it made a great impression on the positive team, but what do you think, Tetora-kun?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora shocked %}
Huh!? You’re assignin’ me into the negative team!?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori worried0 %}
At times like this, you always join me in throwing complaints, don’t you…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora norsmile %}
That’s only before the actual performance. The moment we’re up on stage, I intend to take things seriously and do my ultimate best. But ‘course, the same goes for Midori-kun, right~♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori sigh %}
Yeah… I can’t really run away anywhere once I’m on stage, after all… I’ve got no choice but to buckle down and do my best…

Plus, I <em>do</em> wanna be of use to Shinkai-senpai for this job, and it’s not like I have no motivation to work hard…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata v2 %}
good boy\~♪ we will do our best [together]\~!

let’s [say] it together now~ *puka, puka…♪ <th>(sways left and right)</th>*
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shinobu smilesoft %}
Ahaha. For better or worse, Shinkai Taichou-dono’s Ryuseitai is rather peculiar.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori awkward %}
I know, right~… That’s the one thing that never changed until the very end…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora awkward0 %}
Ossu, yeah. It really is for better or worse.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata curious %}
oh\~? do you have any [complaints] about that\~?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori norsmile %}
No… When I was made to take the commander role, everyone also gave their absolute best from start to end.

It’s now my turn to do the same, right? Mhm, probably…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki smilesoft2 %}
Fufu.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki serious %}
However, while I’d rather not say something so negative and pessimistic right before our stage… will this really be alright as is?

Will the people of Hoshijima really agree to our side of the story? Mm, before that, will they even lend us their ears…?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata norsmile %}
that will simply [depend] on us, yes?

we will [perform] as best as we can, and grab everyone’s [attention] with our song and dance. that is our [field of expertise], yes?

if we make them watch us while thinking “eh, what’s going on?” by causing a ruckus and doing whatever ridiculous thing we have in mind, we will have [succeeded greatly].

no, in fact… we will not get [anywhere] with them unless we gather their [attention] in that way.

before we can convince them to [agree] to our [side], we must first have them hear what we have to [say].
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora smileconfident %}
Ossu. We’ve worked so hard together for a whole week for that purpose. We followed Shinkai-senpai’s bizarre guidance, all for the sake of creating the ideal stage of his dreams.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori frustrated %}
I’m so sick of fish… I’m so sick of fish…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shinobu surprised0 %}
Ah— Midori-kun is reliving his trauma again!?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki grin2 %}
Are you alright, Takamine!? Look, here are some vegetables! Fresh, spring vegetables…!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori worried %}
Uu, uu— Vegetables? Not fish…?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora grin %}
Ahaha, I don’t blame him for feelin’ traumatized. I mean, we got thrown in a water tank full’a fish so that “we learn how it feels to be a fish”.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora sightired %}
It was real rough on me, too. Fish’s eyes are so devoid of life and terrifying, aren’t they…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shinobu sighdrop %}
Personally, the absolute roughest part was once again not knowing why on earth we were being made to do all this.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki sighfrown %}
Yeah, that’s because while I could see some slight improvement in Kanata’s leadership, his explanations remained as lacking as ever.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata frown %}
gosh, everyone just keeps having [complaints]~?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata smilesoft %}
the reason is obviously for the sake of our [performance]. i thought it would be unnecessary to [explain] something as obvious as this, but—

every single thing we did was for the sake of our typical, usual fun [stage].

let’s [solve] everything with “that”, the same way we always do.

that is our very own [finishing move]~♪
{% endbubble %}

## Chapter 12

{% bubble Kanata smileconfident %}
—right then.

it is [fun] to have a chat, but we cannot keep having [fun] by ourselves forever.

we are [idols], after all.

and kona-chan, with such pure [feelings], said that [idols] are [interesting] people, didn’t he?

we [cannot] save the [world] and [mankind] like the heroes in [tokusatsu shows].

[human beings] are probably incapable of doing something a [god] could do.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata smilesoft %}
but. we are capable of making this [world] we [exist] within into a more [glittering place], even if only a liiittle bit.

we can surely turn it into an amusing, happy, sparkling [world].

let’s become [stars] that light up the [world] just like that.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora smile %}
Ossu. I always feel like Shinkai-Taichou’s words are floaty and demand comprehension skills, but…

This time ‘round, it was super easy to understand what you said.

That’s the ideal vision of Ryuseitai that you’re aiming for, right, Shinkai-Taichou?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata fist %}
yes. that is what [fish ryuseitai], the unit that i [lead], is all about!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki norsmile %}
Just to be clear, it’s officially written as “Ryuseitai-C” in the documents.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata yare %}
chiaki is <em>so</em> [particular] sometimes.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori curious %}
Mm? Why was it “C” again…? Wouldn’t it be “B” for “Blue”…?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora norsmile %}
Yeah, but Shinkai-Taichou said it’d be the exact same as Ryuseitai Black’s “Ryuseitai-B”, the unit that I lead. So he let me have the name when it was my turn as the commander.

He said it’d be confusing if we had the same acronyms, so he’s fine with being “C” for “Cobalt Blue” — and that he’s actually happy with that name, ‘cuz it’s way closer to the color of the ocean.

Thinkin’ about it, Shinkai-Taichou has always handed over a lotta different things to us juniors in particular, huh?

Like, he’d always prioritize what we wanna do over what he wants to do—
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata smile %}
fufufu. you make it sound like i am a [saint], but i simply just did not have any particular [desires] of my own, you know?
{% endbubble %}

{% img /img/es/eventstory/stellamaris/tetorabcg.jpg %}

{% bubble Tetora stellabcg %}
Still, I always felt so grateful for it.

That’s why this time ‘round, I wanna support what you wanna do as the leader, Shinkai-Taichou! No, not just that — I wanna reach that goal together![^13]
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki fist %}
Yeah, with full force! Our feelings are one, Kanata!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata nod2 %}
yes. that is the one thing i will always, aaalways believe in.

</div>

{% bubble Eichi snicker %}
……Pfft. ♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Eichi awkward %}
I-I didn’t once expect to hear him say that, and out of <em>nowhere</em> at that. This is exactly why Ryuseitai’s performances are so interesting, but watching them is quite bad for the heart, isn’t it?

I heard that there are a lot of elderly people with weak hearts in Hoshijima, so perhaps it would be safer to avoid shocking turns of events, no?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tori curious %}
Honestly, I’m also just confused like, “Huh, why’s he saying that all of a sudden?”

But the Hoshijima residents are basically worshippers of some religion, right?

So I guess he thought it’d be most effective to call himself “god” so that it reaches their hearts…?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Eichi smile %}
My, and he seemed so fed up with the god occupation, too. Does this mean you can act this role as well if necessary, Shinkai-kun?

During the subjugation of the Five Eccentrics in Yumenosaki Academy, the person who took care of the showdown against Shinkai-kun was also someone closely tied to religion — Keito, the son of a temple.[^14]

So, as someone who didn’t fight him directly, I haven’t truly experienced just how ghastly and intimidating Shinkai-kun can be.

That being said, I do remember quite well the eerie atmosphere that surrounded the events related to the Yaobikuni during the War Days.

It was beyond human comprehension, and I can’t properly explain what it was like.

I also never saw the incident itself. However, I remember well the astonished look on Keito’s face after he had clashed with Shinkai-kun — As if he had witnessed something “completely out of this world”.

In order to stir a change in Hoshijima, where time has stopped for eons, perhaps what is necessary here isn’t a realistic power like money or authority… But a paranormal, mystical power similarly to that event.[^15]
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Eichi smilesoft %}
Right then. Now, is it truly possible for a conceptual being such as a non-existant god to respond to realistic issues that affect the daily lives of many human beings?

It’s time for the “living god” to show us what he’s capable of. Ahh, how thrilling.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tori worried %}
Uh, I feel super nervous from worry, though…

Are we sure it’s going to go okay? Restoring a ruined island is a pretty serious topic; can that airheaded unit Ryuseitai really make this work?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Eichi smileconfident %}
Who knows? Fufu, in fact, this is the perfect moment to say “Only God knows”. ♪

They aren’t fictional heroes who can always overcome any huge predicament without exception, and so they can’t avoid worrying those watching over them…

But for some strange reason, I hold an illogical conviction that, as long as it’s them, they’ll be able to solve any problem that comes their way.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Eichi smilesoft2 %}
I’m envious of you, Chiaki. You must’ve felt a similar kind of deep emotion whenever you’d watch your heroes in action on the television, ever since your early days of childhood.

The same can be said about the people of Hoshijima, but… The lives of people with something they can believe in no matter what must be so warm and relieving, beyond my very imagination.

I mean this without any sarcasm whatsoever, but — I truly feel just a tiny bit envious of that.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tori norsmile %}
…I also have that, y’know. Something I can believe in no matter what.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Eichi %}
Oh? I had no idea you were a religious person.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tori frown %}
If you’re playing dumb, then you’re just being mean, Eichi-sama…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tori smilesoft %}
But, well, it’s not just me. I think everyone lives their lives believing in something.

Be it a hero, a god… or maybe even an idol that represents your ideal self—

I’m sure the lives of people who’ve found that sparkling something are filled with happiness, aren’t they?

And I bet those Ryuseitai guys are trying to become “exactly that”, yeah? Well, not that I’d know what a bunch of idiots are up to~

## Chapter 13

……♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mizusaba %}
Nyahaha\~ You look like you’re having fun too, Konata-sama\~?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Konata norsmile %}
Yes, I am. Ever since I encountered everyone from Ryuseitai, all I’ve been experiencing are enjoyable things.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mizusaba %}
Mhm, mhm. I thought it was a one-time joke, but they’re really doing those fish-like movements even on stage\~. It’s such a delight to see\~♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Konata nod2 %}
Indeed. It sort of makes you want to copy their movements, doesn’t it? All wiggly and wobbly~…♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mizusaba %}
Cuuute\~♪ How about you copy after Kanata-sama and become an idol too, Konata-sama\~? I’m sure you’d get raving reviews for being so adorable\~?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Konata norsmile %}
I do somewhat admire what they do as well, but… I have a duty to lead all the people of Hoshijima.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mizusaba %}
That’s not a responsibility to throw on a kid, though\~? My grandpa likes to lead people, so why not leave that job to elders with free time like him\~?

Plus, in reality, Konata-sama is just a symbol of the island; the actual management is done by the adults, right?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Konata frown %}
Yes. That is why even if I proclaim myself as a higher-up of the island and act important, the fact of the matter is that I have no authority whatsoever.

Of course, everyone respects me. However, for any major decisions that could change the state of the island, it is necessary to obtain approval from the adults, not me.

Even if I were accepting of change, that would simply just be my own personal feelings on the matter when it all comes down to it.

Having gatherings to play childish games will not be enough to alter the entire island.[^16]

I am a child, so such games can still fool me — but the same can’t be said for adults, correct?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mizusaba %}
I wonder\~? The people acting like grown-ups, including me — We’re all just kids assuming the role of an adult\~?

So I bet adults would genuinely be amazed if they witnessed something awesome, just like kids~.

They’ll be so surprised and moved, that it’ll make them smile~♪

Really, it’s just that adults have lived for a long time and have seen a lot of amazing things countless times, so their senses just grew numb over time, yeah~?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Konata %}
Indeed, Mizusaba-san gives the impression of someone who would remain composed no matter the situation, unlike me.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mizusaba %}
Oh\~? Why does it feel like you’re casually treating me like an old and slow person whose senses have completely died\~? Despite how I seem, I’m actually underage, y’know\~?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Konata smileconfident %}
Ah, really? You seem so mature, perhaps because of your huge size. You’re so young, yet you’re working already — That’s admirable!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mizusaba %}
You could say the same about Ryuseitai~. Well, following up what you said with that makes it sound like I’m indirectly complimenting myself…

But still, it’s admirable that they feel the urge to do something for someone else’s sake despite their young age~♪

They’re incredible people to respect~♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Konata norsmile %}
Yes. I would like to become like that, as well.

A respectable human being, just like them.
{% endbubble %}

<div class="msr-narration">
    <p>The screen shakes</p>
</div>

{% bubble Konata surprised %}
…W-Woah? The area shook slightly just now, didn’t it? This means that Ryuseitai’s stage has truly begun at last, right?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mizusaba %}
Be careful not to trip on yourself, okay\~. I’ll lift you up\~, Konata-sama.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Konata sad2 %}
Mmrph… I cannot stand how I can only ever be protected. I want to become an adult already.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mizusaba %}
No need to be in a rush\~, we have to take it nice and slow… Okay\~? ♪ Doesn’t matter if it’s human or fish, any living being has to go through that, y’know\~?

Even the whale shark “Mizusaba” wasn’t huge from the start\~. When I was younger, I’d always rely on Grandpa and Ani-sama\~.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Konata %}
Mm… The way you and I look right now is surely the same relationship that Hoshijima and the Okinawa mainland have.

Being spoiled and pampered while carried by a large being—
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Konata smilesoft %}
However, we <em>will</em> change. It might be hard to do so immediately… But still, that is why you don’t need to carry me like this.

Mizusaba-san is huge, so I cannot see in front of me when you carry me.

But you see, I would like to witness it all.

The scenery of Hoshijima as it changes—

The very way that the world we live in changes form entirely.

## Chapter 14

{% img /img/es/eventstory/stellamaris/p2_14.jpg %}

{% bubble Kanata smile %}
“♪\~♪\~♪”
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki smileconfident %}
“~…♪”
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shinobu awkward %}
T-This is an even more peculiar atmosphere than I had imagined.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori idle %}
Yeah… Though, I think as part of Shinkai-senpai’s plan, he asked Konata-kun to help him call over all the people across the island to join this “stage” as guests.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki idle %}
Mm. It seems that as per our plan, they’ve gathered to the stage in curiosity, wondering what’s going on, but—
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shinobu worried %}
Such a large number of people have gathered here, yet I hear none of the cheers from earlier… What on earth is with this awfully somber atmosphere?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori srsthinking %}
Yeah, right…? It’s completely different from our usual audience… But I guess with commanders changing every time, so would the unit’s direction, and that means the type of audience, too…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora serious %}
The atmosphere becoming <em>this</em> bizarrely supernatural is unheard-of for our stages, isn’t it?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki idle %}
Yeah. Although, Kanata deliberately prepared a bright song and performance, as he predicted it’d be a problem if the atmosphere becomes too grim.

On the other hand, the air of our performance and the supernatural atmosphere are a bad combination — it’s created a bizarre ambience here.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori worried %}
It’s reaching a point where it feels too unbearable to be onstage, though…?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata scold %}
hey\~! [focus], please! i do understand how you all feel, okay\~?

i also did not [expect] it to get this [solemn]. maybe i should not have introduced myself as [god] after all~?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata idle %}
i did mention before that the people of [hoshijima] are much more [devoted] to the religion than the people of my [area] are, after all.

so since this is “god’s stage”, they are watching us extremely [seriously].
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shinobu frown %}
Well, despite how it may feel, I do understand that it was necessary for Shinkai-dono to refer to himself as “god” in order to have the islanders earnestly hear us out.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora worried %}
But it <em>seriously</em> feels like we’re in some kinda religious ritual, y’know…? We’re just casually singing ‘bout fishes onstage, so the contrast is crazy!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki norsmile2 %}
This island <em>did</em> have zero connections to idol culture for a very long time, so I don’t even think the islanders themselves know how they’re supposed to behave here.

I don’t believe that they are put off by our stage or think it’s boring or anything. Mm, hopefully.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora norsmile %}
True, looking at their expressions, they seem to be enjoying themselves.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shinobu smile %}
Mhm. It’s simply that the way they’re reacting is weak. Otherwise, they seem to be responding with a fair amount of joy in their own way.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki smileconfident %}
Fufu. Now that I think about it, it’s rare for us to perform in front of an audience like this.

Typically, our main audience are kiddos who love heroes, particularly back during our Yumenosaki days.

To those kids, tokusatsu shows are something that naturally exists. They would know the gist of it even if we didn’t explain it to them.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki smilesoft %}
However, idols and heroes are something completely unknown to the people of this island, right?

Human beings have always feared the dark since ancient times. The unknown is terrifying.

Just as we feel reluctant towards a religion we don’t know well—

The people of Hoshijima see what is common sense to <em>us</em> as the terrifying unknown.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata serious %}
yes. that is also likely why they [opposed] the [restoration] of [hoshijima], even though it [benefits] them, too.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora serious %}
Yeah, they were against the construction of an amusement park in Hoshijima, and hindered its progress, right?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata frown %}
yes. while of course, it is a [wrongful deed] where they had gone a little [too far], and should be tried under [law]…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki idle %}
There’s marginal space to take the circumstances into account. Having the urge to get rid of terrifying things from your sight is a natural instinct found not only in mankind, but among living things as a whole.

No… It’s a natural instinct to try and remove any foreign material that could destroy this peaceful world.
{% endbubble %}

{% img /img/es/eventstory/stellamaris/chiakibcg.jpg %}

{% bubble Chiaki stellabcg %}
To the people of Hoshijima, we— <em>ES</em> itself was the evil organization, the monster villain, the kaijuu.

I doubt that the radical people of Hoshijima wanted to cause actual harm.

On the contrary, they were trying to stand strong and fight against that kaijuu, all for the sake of protecting their beloved world.

That’s exactly why — If they were to learn that the kaijuu has a heart of its own, that it’s possible to get along if they were to talk it out… They would surely stop their attacks.

Even tokusatsu heroes don’t ever one-sidedly eradicate evil without question.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori norsmile %}
It’s overbearing how Senpai compares everything to tokusatsu… But, well, I get what you’re trying to say.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora smileconfident %}
Ossu. We also wanted to get along as much as possible. We wanted to come to understand the situation and accept the changes.

Rather than forcing change on us by getting invaded and trampled on, we wanted to walk down the path side-by-side together.

Not just that… We wanted to build a happy future together.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora norsmile2 %}
All the things ES didn’t do for us, we’d like to do ‘em for the people of Hoshijima. Abused kids don’t always turn into abusers themselves.

In fact… If we become respectable parents without ever warping or corrupting despite everythin’ — only then would it truly be our victory.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori smile %}
I don’t think life is all about wins and losses, but I somehow get what Tetora-kun’s saying, too… Yeah, it’s not like I wanna become a bitter person, either…

If I can live my life straightforwardly, then that’s always gonna be the best option, right?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shinobu fist %}
Mhm! Let’s live our lives with pride, now and forever!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata grin %}
fufufu~ you have all grown up to be so [splendid], haven’t you?

doesn’t it make you feel proud as well, chiaki~♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki cryalmost %}
Sorry, can I cry a bit?[^17]
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata grin %}
no, you cannot~ we should keep [smiling] until our performance ends, right?

that is what ryuseitai is all about.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata smileexplain %}
“—hello, everyone.”

“people of [hoshijima], please look around you.”

“we are grateful that you have all given your [attention] to our [stage], but it seems, as well, that there is something you all have not noticed yet—”

“this is no longer the [hoshijima] that you all know.”
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata smileconfident %}
“the [building] we have asked you to gather in is not actually a [building]; it was a [ship] all along!”
{% endbubble %}

## Chapter 15

{% img /img/es/eventstory/stellamaris/p2_15.jpg %}

{% bubble Eichi %}
Fufu. “Stella Maris”, was it? It’s a perfectly fitting name here.

It’s the given name of Saint Mary, the goddess who protects people on voyage — the star that guides those navigating in pitch darkness with uncertainty.[^18]

Guided by that star, the people of Hoshijima found their way to an unknown world.

Since they had been confined to their land for such a long time, it must feel like they time traveled to the future, doesn’t it? My, I truly cannot help but worry for the elderly’s faint hearts. ♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tori curious %}
But why did Ryuseitai do that? Why’d they transport everyone to the mainland on a ship…?

We told them that we’ll help them out however we can, so we requested an influential person to get them a ship for this stage…

But it’s a little too large-scaled for a simple performance, isn’t it?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Eichi %}
Investment-wise, it’s pretty cheap in the long run, no? If all goes according to plan, and the people of Hoshijima become enthusiastic for the restoration of the island—

Then there’ll still be a huge surplus in their budget, especially compared to having the construction work be put on pause due to continuous interference. It’s necessary expenses, essentially.

But of course, in the case that the residents *don’t* change their mind, then it means they threw all their money down the drain for a foolish plan.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Eichi smile %}
Now then. He’s just performed a phenomenal miracle — In a god-like fashion, he’s taking the people on a journey across time and space…

But what was the true significance to that act in the end? I’ve already figured it out, but can <em>you</em> tell, Tori? ♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tori smilesoft %}
Well, I can totally tell that you’re acting super excited like a little kid, Eichi-sama. You surprisingly like flashy stuff, after all~ You must feel so envious of Ryuseitai right now, right? ♪
