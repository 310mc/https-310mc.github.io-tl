## Chapter 1

{% note narration %}
**Chapter TL Note:** The chapter title “birthplace of stars” is written in hiragana only, so I've written the title in lowercase letters, similar to how Kanata's speech quirk (speaks in hiragana only) is written in my translations.

<div class="msr-narration">
    <p>Next day. Okinawa mainland, at the ES Okinawa branch…</p>
</div>

{% bubble Tetora curious %}
Woah…

I-I did hear ‘bout it, but… There seriously <em>is</em> an ES-lookin’ building in Okinawa, huh.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori curious %}
There was also one in Australia, right…[^1] They really build these things like convenience stores, huh?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki smileexplain %}
From Tenshouin’s standpoint, I think that he wants to make idols into something as familiar as convenience stores are to the public.

The more familiar and convenient it is, the more people will come to accept it.

And once something is accepted and becomes the “norm”, it can’t crumble all that easily.

It’s exactly like how long ago, people had to go through the trouble of buying tickets to ride trains — but even when we hear stories about those past experiences, it’s still hard for us current generation to imagine what it was like.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora norsmile %}
That’s ‘cuz nowadays, almost everyone uses their phone, and if not that, then a Suica card instead.[^2]

We can barely picture what life was like when there were only physical tickets. It’d be even harder to imagine the times before that, when trains and automobiles didn’t exist at all.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki idle %}
Yeah. The reality before us is being repainted, and the past quietly being long forgotten.

In the same fashion, the era when ES and idol culture were not the “norm” will slowly become one with the past, and vanish into thin air.

That’s likely Tenshouin’s — ES’s goal.

Slowly, but surely… ES is corroding reality, this very world.

They’re invading every part of it.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora frown %}
ES’s morphing into an evil organization hasn’t stopped at all, huh.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki frown %}
It would’ve been much simpler if ES was merely an evil organization, though. We would’ve only needed to thwart their over-ambitious goals.

However, to us idols who profit greatly the more ES flourishes, that’s entirely unfeasible.

If we deny ES, we’d be denying the very ground we need to stand — the very atmosphere we need in order to breathe.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki serious %}
We’re kept alive through the company. The only thing we’re likely able to do is rectify every mistake made by our “protective guardian” known as ES.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki norsmile2 %}
Fortunately, we aren’t the only ones who feel this way. We were able to unite at the SS stage through it.

I’ve heard that Anzu has also partially separated herself from ES and is working independently now.

Let’s watch over these buds of hope so that they don’t get trampled, while doing what we can, one step at a time.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki smileexplain %}
“The black flame is the mark of effort” isn’t only your catchphrase, Nagumo.

It was by burning our nestled spirits together that every single color — every single flame became one.

That’s who we are now — the reborn Ryuseitai.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora smile %}
Ossu. Even if the color of the flame looks different each time we switch commanders, it’s actually the same flame all along. I’ll burn that flame bright, and let it light up the dark world.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori curious %}
…Lately, Morisawa-senpai and Tetora-kun have been strangely getting along, haven’t they?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shinobu smile %}
Not simply just getting along; it seems as though they’re talking on an equal footing with each other. As if they both see the same thing.

Fufu. Maybe there’s a small gap between the two of us and Tetora-kun now, don’t you think?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori nod %}
I don’t mind anything, as long as it means that I don’t look like I’m the only one falling behind… Shinobu-kun’s the only one who needs to stay in the same place as me forever…♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shinobu shocked %}
I-I’d also like to become stronger and grow wonderfully, you know!?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata smilesoft %}
okay now, your attention please~♪

i am sorry that i kept you all [waiting]. i have finally finished [preparing] everything, so let’s [depart].
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki curious %}
Preparing? Wait, Kanata, what’s that stuffed toy…? It seems to be slightly moving about…?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata grin %}
this is the turtle [kamegorou]’s relative, [turtlellius iii]~♪[^3]
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora awkward0 %}
Why does it sound like a Roman emperor name… —Wait, the name is the last thing I wanna ask ‘bout right now.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata smileexplain %}
yes. this is actually a [mascot costume], and kona-chan is inside it.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki idle %}
“Kona-chan”… You mean the head of Hoshijima, Minase Konata-kun?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata smileconfident %}
yes. he had [withdrawn] from society for a long time, so he is a little [afraid] of [strangers], so to speak…

it seems he does not want to be in the presence of the [public], so i am hiding him.

but. since kona-chan said that he [wants] to learn more about [idols]…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki norsmile %}
That’s why we decided to show him around ES, the headquarters of the cutting-edge idol movement, right? Seeing is believing, as they say.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata norsmile %}
yes. i thought that if he sees the [building], he will be able to understand the current way [idols] are [treated] in this age—

in other words, its [current state] would become [clear] to him.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora northinking %}
Makes sense, ‘cuz in reality, society’s understanding of idols is being rapidly repainted thanks to ES. The way idols were seen in the past isn’t relevant anymore.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori sighdrop %}
Yeah, it’s rough just keeping up… I don’t think I’m keeping up at all, actually.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki norsmile %}
Yeah. The only thing we can do is ensure we stand our ground so that we don’t get thrown off.

In any case, we wanted to have a discussion with <em>fine</em> either way, as they’ve been up to something in Okinawa just like us.

At the very least, I’d like to exchange information and align our steps with them. They’re ES idols in the same agency as us — we should be able to unite forces.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori norsmile %}
That’s true… It seems that Morisawa-senpai is close with Tenshouin-senpai, Shinkai-senpai with Hibiki-senpai, and there’s Shinobu-kun who’s got ties with Himemiya-kun at the Student Council, so they’re close to some extent too.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori smilesoft %}
Meanwhile, Master Artist Fushimi and I love each other under the most ideal artist-fan relationship, so surprisingly, we could get along with <em>fine</em> pretty well, right…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shinobu awkward %}
I believe there can be several theories for the last one, though.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora smileconfident %}
Heheh. We were enemies with <em>fine</em> at first, but as times change, so do relationships, huh?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata norsmile %}
yes. i personally do not want to be on good terms with mr. [emperor] much, but—

i will put aside those [personal] feelings of mine for now.

we should not carry [personal feelings] like that in our work. isn’t that right?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki smile %}
Yeah. We need to focus all our energy on our task to restore Hoshijima. To be honest, I feel that this request is far too much for us to handle, but…

I assume that Tenshouin can see the “full picture”, more than any of us. So I expect that by talking to him, we’ll be able to find the clue to crack this case.
{% endbubble %}

## Chapter 2

{% img /img/es/eventstory/stellamaris/p2_2.jpg %}

<div class="msr-narration">
    <p>Several minutes later. In the ES Okinawa branch, the reception office…</p>
</div>

{% bubble Eichi frown %}
—I was hoping I wouldn’t have to see your faces even in Okinawa.

How unbearable… Could you leave at once?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki surprised0 %}
W-Why, Tenshouin!? Do you hate me!?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Eichi frown2 %}
Well, if I had the choice between “like” and “dislike”, I’d choose the latter… And as it gets hotter here, I think I’ll grow to dislike you even more.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tori scold %}
Yeah, you’re <em>so</em> suffocating! Get outta Okinawa right this instant, you human heater!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shinobu norsmile %}
Now, now… Don’t get so agitated, Tori-kun. It’ll make the room feel unnecessarily hotter, and you only lose out by being so aggressive with others over everything, you know?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tori sightired %}
Mm~… Yeah, I know.

Sorry. Our project’s not really going so well, so I guess I was a little on edge.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki serious %}
The project isn’t going well? That can’t be true, can it? I mean, you’ve built some kind of ES branch on the mainland—
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Eichi frown %}
Anyone can do this much, you know. All you have to do is buy the land and hire construction workers.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Eichi serious %}
However, our final objective is to take control over Hoshijima — the land that was once confined away from the idol industry for a long time.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tori surprised %}
Hiyah!? W-What? Is it just me, or did that plushie just move?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata smilesoft %}
that is just your imagination~ there is no way a [stuffed toy] can move, right?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tori serious %}
Mm… Anyway, Eichi-sama’s kinda expressing it in poor taste as always, but basically this whole procedure has an extremely ceremonious factor to it.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori curious %}
Mm? Mmm…? It’s hard to understand what you’re saying when you use such complicated words…?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Eichi norsmile %}
Ah, you see, Tori sometimes talks about difficult topics he hears from me without properly digesting it first. Although, it’s adorably charming in its own right, like a child imitating how his parent talks.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tori awkward %}
Mm… Um, so, to put it in easier terms…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tori serious %}
I dunno if you guys from Ryuseitai know this, but — It’s said that this industry has been controlled by a super distinguished, god-like figure for the looongest time.

That person’s time was far back in the past, but his influence has stuck around all the way until recently—
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki northinking %}
Ahh, is this about that, uh, “Godfather” was it?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Eichi serious %}
Yes. It probably sounds like a fairytale, but it’s an essential story to know — His influence affects us of this current era, as well.

There was once a God in this world.

However, that God died. And now, we are merely cutting up the debris of his legacy together, just barely scraping by with that food.

Or rather… Until ES was established, that was the wretched state we had been in.

But times have changed, and so has our trajectory. As time progressed and the change of generations repeated, God’s influential power began to slowly decrease in due time.

The conquest for Hoshijima is a crucial event to mark the symbol of that shift.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tori surprised %}
Hiyah!? T-The plushie moved again!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Eichi smile %}
…In fact. Apparently, the very person who made Hoshijima into a confined land, and never allowed any idol culture to come in contact with it is that God in question.

It’s unclear why he had made that decision. But the daydreaming folks believe there could possibly be hidden treasure left behind in Hoshijima by that God—

And so, they keep talking about such nonsense. Fufu.

Perhaps if I obtained that hidden treasure, my idol industry would develop in abundance, don’t you think?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki idle %}
The idol industry isn’t your private property, though… But, well, I understand what you’re trying to say.

I was wondering why ES would go through so much effort to put their hands on an isolated island nobody knows about, that isn’t even on a map…

But I see now. By boldly breaking a taboo set by that so-called God, they prove themselves worthy.

“We are no longer under the control of God.”

“We are free.”

These series of events have all been for the ceremony where ES can finally assert these statements.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Eichi %}
You may look like an idiot, Chiaki, but your comprehension skills are as impressive as ever. I can see reading all those books long ago have taken you far.

Indeed, nobody is seeking practical benefits through this project. What’s important here is to tear down the regulation that God had established.

Once we’ve successfully accomplished this objective, we’ll stand proud as an independent body. We’ll be able to declare boldly:

“We’ve freed ourselves from the restraints of God. We, ES, are now the supreme ruler of this world.”

“We are now the new ruler of the idol industry.” — yes?
{% endbubble %}

## Chapter 3

{% bubble Chiaki srsthinking %}
Mm~… I feel as though you’re using far too much money for a mere ceremony… But well, if it’s you, Tenshouin, you’d probably be able to make profit from even a trivial event.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Eichi %}
I’m not making that many assertive moves this time, actually. Those tales of God couldn’t matter any less to me.

That’s why, since this boy here also wanted it this way — I’ve entrusted everything to do with this project to Tori.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tori sad2 %}
Mhm… But as I mentioned earlier, it isn’t going really well so far, and it’s making me feel pathetic.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Eichi %}
It’s normal for there to be disputes during a land’s development project. We’re trespassing onto other people’s territory, after all. It’s only natural that the “native people” would oppose it.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki idle %}
Is that what happened? We also came into contact with the residents after a number of events, but they were trying to open up the closed Hoshijima to the outside world…?

At the very least, they didn’t show any opposition towards us. Surely this would mean that they also want that ruins-filled island to be restored.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Eichi serious %}
Are you sure that’s really true?

I don’t know who you met and talked to, but I don’t see how it’s possible for there to be absolutely no opposition whatsoever.

As a matter of fact, the model of the amusement park we had built at the end of last year in Hoshijima, the ATLANTIS[^4] — It was recently destroyed by someone.

Along with a threat to never dare touch their land again.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shinobu worried %}
What…? I never knew that such an extreme incident had occurred.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori srsthinking %}
Yeah… It was super peaceful… At least, where we were—
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Eichi yare %}
Well, it isn’t so grave that it needs to be reported. We had only temporarily built the entrance’s vicinity for ATLANTIS, and there were no actual injuries.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tori frown %}
But still, because of that incident, the construction workers we hired got freaked out, and the ATLANTIS construction project has been put to a stop for now.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tori smilesoft %}
That’s exactly why I’m expecting a lot from you, Ryuseitai.

I don’t know why exactly, but the Hoshijima residents have accepted you, right? I heard something like that from Shinobu.

In that case, that means you can also talk it out with the residents. Clear the doubts in their hearts, okay? In the friendly, over-familiar way you guys are known for.

Until you hear out the locals here, understand their feelings, and acknowledge them—

I can’t afford to carry on with the ATLANTIS construction project from my side.

Because even if we bulldozed through this with the power of authority and money, it’d only increase the chances of making grudges and ruining the project down the line, right?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Eichi awkward %}
That hurts to hear. It’s easier that way, though, so I can’t help but choose that method almost every time… It settles everything much quicker, too.

However, Tori seems to prefer not choosing such a violent method.

It’s quite a naive, idealistic mindset, but — This project is centered around Tori, so his wishes will be prioritized above all.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Eichi serious %}
All that being said, I don’t want to waste time on a task as relatively trivial as that forever, so if I come to the conclusion that this is far too much for your unit and for Tori — I will intervene.

Even if it means transforming that peaceful island into hell, I <em>will</em> accomplish our goal.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Eichi smile %}
If that sounds detestable to you, then it’s time to brace yourself and take on this challenge with all your might.

Despite everything, I’m expecting a lot from you Ryuseitai.
{% endbubble %}

{% img /img/es/eventstory/stellamaris/p2_3.jpg %}

<div class="msr-narration">
    <p>Around an hour later. At a restaurant near the ES Okinawa branch building…</p>
</div>

{% bubble Chiaki srsthinking %}
……………
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mizusaba %}
Ah— Welcome baaack~♪

That was surprisingly fast\~? What’s up? Did you forget something\~?

Or are you just here to eat now that it’s lunchtime?

Then I’ll cook you the best meal yet~. Truth be told, I’m usually working here as a chef—
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki smileconfident %}
Ahh, we would love that. We need to first nourish ourselves and get our blood pumping in our heads.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata smileexplain %}
fufu. we had to listen to a [good-for-nothing] talk, so we decided to first [organize] our thoughts.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori sighfrown %}
Yeah… After that conversation, it wasn’t really the right mood to show Konata-kun the cutting-edge of idol culture anymore…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mizusaba %}
Hmm\~. That’s too bad\~? Wasn’t Konata-sama really looking forward to that\~?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Konata frownshake %}
Please don’t pat my head. When you do it, I get terrified by the thought of being flattened.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mizusaba %}
Oh\~? Konata-sama is so tiny and cute, though\~? I could gobble you up in one bite\~♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Konata horrified %}
…………
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata awkward %}
please do not frighten my [little brother] so much, mizusaba-san.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mizusaba %}
I didn’t mean to do that at all, though\~. Sorry, okay? It’s just a joke, really\~?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Konata sighfrown %}
No, I’m aware you mean no harm. As someone from the mainland, you have no obligation to be concerned with our affairs…

Yet here you are, involving yourself— No, <em>cooperating</em> with us. It’s unthinkable that I’d ever see that as a burden, when I should be showing you gratitude.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mizusaba %}
No need to be so reserved~ Aren’t we neighbors? We should help each other out when we’re in trouble~♪
