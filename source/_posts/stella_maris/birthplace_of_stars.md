## Chapter 1

{% note narration %}
**Chapter TL Note:** The chapter title “birthplace of stars” is written in hiragana only, so I've written the title in lowercase letters, similar to how Kanata's speech quirk (speaks in hiragana only) is written in my translations.

<div class="msr-narration">
    <p>Next day. Okinawa mainland, at the ES Okinawa branch…</p>
</div>

{% bubble Tetora curious %}
Woah…

I-I did hear ‘bout it, but… There seriously <em>is</em> an ES-lookin’ building in Okinawa, huh.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori curious %}
There was also one in Australia, right…[^1] They really build these things like convenience stores, huh?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki smileexplain %}
From Tenshouin’s standpoint, I think that he wants to make idols into something as familiar as convenience stores are to the public.

The more familiar and convenient it is, the more people will come to accept it.

And once something is accepted and becomes the “norm”, it can’t crumble all that easily.

It’s exactly like how long ago, people had to go through the trouble of buying tickets to ride trains — but even when we hear stories about those past experiences, it’s still hard for us current generation to imagine what it was like.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora norsmile %}
That’s ‘cuz nowadays, almost everyone uses their phone, and if not that, then a Suica card instead.[^2]

We can barely picture what life was like when there were only physical tickets. It’d be even harder to imagine the times before that, when trains and automobiles didn’t exist at all.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki idle %}
Yeah. The reality before us is being repainted, and the past quietly being long forgotten.

In the same fashion, the era when ES and idol culture were not the “norm” will slowly become one with the past, and vanish into thin air.

That’s likely Tenshouin’s — ES’s goal.

Slowly, but surely… ES is corroding reality, this very world.

They’re invading every part of it.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora frown %}
ES’s morphing into an evil organization hasn’t stopped at all, huh.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki frown %}
It would’ve been much simpler if ES was merely an evil organization, though. We would’ve only needed to thwart their over-ambitious goals.

However, to us idols who profit greatly the more ES flourishes, that’s entirely unfeasible.

If we deny ES, we’d be denying the very ground we need to stand — the very atmosphere we need in order to breathe.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki serious %}
We’re kept alive through the company. The only thing we’re likely able to do is rectify every mistake made by our “protective guardian” known as ES.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki norsmile2 %}
Fortunately, we aren’t the only ones who feel this way. We were able to unite at the SS stage through it.

I’ve heard that Anzu has also partially separated herself from ES and is working independently now.

Let’s watch over these buds of hope so that they don’t get trampled, while doing what we can, one step at a time.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki smileexplain %}
“The black flame is the mark of effort” isn’t only your catchphrase, Nagumo.

It was by burning our nestled spirits together that every single color — every single flame became one.

That’s who we are now — the reborn Ryuseitai.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora smile %}
Ossu. Even if the color of the flame looks different each time we switch commanders, it’s actually the same flame all along. I’ll burn that flame bright, and let it light up the dark world.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori curious %}
…Lately, Morisawa-senpai and Tetora-kun have been strangely getting along, haven’t they?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shinobu smile %}
Not simply just getting along; it seems as though they’re talking on an equal footing with each other. As if they both see the same thing.

Fufu. Maybe there’s a small gap between the two of us and Tetora-kun now, don’t you think?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori nod %}
I don’t mind anything, as long as it means that I don’t look like I’m the only one falling behind… Shinobu-kun’s the only one who needs to stay in the same place as me forever…♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shinobu shocked %}
I-I’d also like to become stronger and grow wonderfully, you know!?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata smilesoft %}
okay now, your attention please~♪

i am sorry that i kept you all [waiting]. i have finally finished [preparing] everything, so let’s [depart].
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki curious %}
Preparing? Wait, Kanata, what’s that stuffed toy…? It seems to be slightly moving about…?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata grin %}
this is the turtle [kamegorou]’s relative, [turtlellius iii]~♪[^3]
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora awkward0 %}
Why does it sound like a Roman emperor name… —Wait, the name is the last thing I wanna ask ‘bout right now.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata smileexplain %}
yes. this is actually a [mascot costume], and kona-chan is inside it.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki idle %}
“Kona-chan”… You mean the head of Hoshijima, Minase Konata-kun?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata smileconfident %}
yes. he had [withdrawn] from society for a long time, so he is a little [afraid] of [strangers], so to speak…

it seems he does not want to be in the presence of the [public], so i am hiding him.

but. since kona-chan said that he [wants] to learn more about [idols]…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki norsmile %}
That’s why we decided to show him around ES, the cutting-edge idol movement, right? Seeing is believing, as they say.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata norsmile %}
yes. i thought that if he sees the [building], he will be able to understand the current way [idols] are [treated] in this age—

in other words, its [current state] would become [clear] to him.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora northinking %}
Makes sense, ‘cuz in reality, society’s understanding of idols is being rapidly repainted thanks to ES. The way idols were seen in the past isn’t relevant anymore.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori sighdrop %}
Yeah, it’s rough just keeping up… I don’t think I’m keeping up at all, actually.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki norsmile %}
Yeah. The only thing we can do is ensure we stand our ground so that we don’t get thrown off.

In any case, we wanted to have a discussion with <em>fine</em> either way, as they’ve been up to something in Okinawa just like us.

At the very least, I’d like to exchange information and align our steps with them. They’re ES idols in the same agency as us — we should be able to unite forces.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori norsmile %}
That’s true… It seems that Morisawa-senpai is close with Tenshouin-senpai, Shinkai-senpai with Hibiki-senpai, and there’s Shinobu-kun who’s got ties with Himemiya-kun at the Student Council, so they’re close to some extent too.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori smilesoft %}
Meanwhile, Master Artist Fushimi and I love each other under the most ideal artist-fan relationship, so surprisingly, we could get along with <em>fine</em> pretty well, right…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shinobu awkward %}
I believe there can be several theories for the last one, though.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora smileconfident %}
Heheh. We were enemies with <em>fine</em> at first, but as times change, so do relationships, huh?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata norsmile %}
yes. i personally do not want to be on good terms with mr. [emperor] much, but—

i will put aside those [personal] feelings of mine for now.

we should not carry [personal feelings] like that in our work. isn’t that right?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki smile %}
Yeah. We need to focus all our energy on our task to restore Hoshijima. To be honest, I feel that this request is far too much for us to handle, but…

I assume that Tenshouin can see the “full picture”, more than any of us. So I expect that by talking to him, we’ll be able to find the clue to crack this case.
