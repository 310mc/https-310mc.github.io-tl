'Suup, Anego! Are you shopping?

I am too, as you can see! I bought some ingredients in the area.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora awkward0 %}
I bought way more than I planned, 'cuz they were having a huge sale…

            I train a ton, so this is easy-peasy stuff for me!

            In fact, I could even carry your stuff, too~! Please let me know if it's ever heavy on you!

            Mostly veggies and seasonings I wanted to try out.

            Midori-kun taught me how to have an eye for the good ones, so I think I managed to buy some nice veggies! I gotta thank him again for the tip~♪

            You get me, Anego…!? I'm so happy~♪

            Since it was such a huge sale, I was almost beaten by the fiery competition among a bunch'a married couples, but I managed to buy 'em in the end!

{% bubble Tetora v2 %}
Actually, I'm gonna get a share of fresh seafood from Shinkai-senpai.

When you have high-quality ingredients, it's natural to have the urge to cook tasty food on your own!

So I plan to make a full course meal with the seafood once I'm back at the dorms~♪

            {% bubble Tetora v2 %}
            Actually, I've never really prepared fish before…

            But I've watched a video of it before, so I've got a pretty good gist of it! As long as I follow the instructions, I'm sure I'll manage!

            Ah, I dunno what I'm gonna get from him, either.

            Shinkai-senpai said it's fish we all know and love. Since it's spring, I'm guessing it's sardine and skipjack tuna?

            Yeah~♪ I'm not really good at cooking or anything, and I'm still learning, but…

            It's just so much fun, and it especially excites me to think of what to make for food.

Since I'm making food and everything, I wanted to treat Ryuseitai to a meal.

But it seems like they're all busy, so they refused my dinner invitation…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora v2 %}
But Hiiro-kun's coming! He said he'll bring over Shiratori-kun too, so I plan to put my all when cooking this meal, to treat 'em good~♪.
