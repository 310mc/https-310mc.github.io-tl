anzu-san, what perfect timing~♪ do you have some [time] right now?

you see, i have a [gift] for you.

here you go~♪ it is a [pearl accessory]…♪

            {% bubble Kanata v2 %}
            yes. i do not have any [use] for it personally, so i would love you to take it~♪

            while they are [real pearls], it is not that [high-grade], so there is no need to hold back, okay?

            {% bubble Kanata v2 %}
            fufu~♪ it is not that big, but it is very shiny and pretty, isn't it?

            i knew you would understand the beauty of these [pearls], anzu-san~♪

            yes. they are authentic [pearls], taken from [akoya pearl oysters].

            you can find such beautiful [jewels] from [shellfish]\~ isn't the [ocean] so wonderful\~?

{% bubble Kanata v2 %}
the other day, i visited another [aquarium], as i thought it would be good to learn more about [rival] businesses.

kaoru was with me, and that was when he and i tried out [fetching pearls] together, because he was interested to try.

the [accessory gift] i gave you is made with the [pearls] i retrieved then.

<div class="minitalk" character="Anzu">
    <div class="minitalk-option">
        <div class="minitalk-option_header">
            You can even make them into an accessory, huh?
        </div>
        <div class="minitalk-option_content">
            {% bubble Kanata v2 %}
            yes. it would be a [waste] to simply keep the [pearls] after retrieving them~

            it seems like you can make them into [key straps] too, not just [accessories]. while they may be a [rival] business, i do think they came up with a nice [idea]…♪

            You were with Hakaze-senpai?

        <div class="minitalk-option_content">
            {% bubble Kanata v2 %}
            yes. he looked to have the free time, so i took him along with me~♪

            oh yes, i think kaoru wanted to give what he made to [someone]. i wonder who he was planning to give it to?

            It sounds difficult.

        <div class="minitalk-option_content">
            {% bubble Kanata v2 %}
            not at all, it was pretty [simple]. you only need to open the [shells] with a [knife].

            if you are ever interested, anzu-san, i will take you to the [aquarium]…♪

{% bubble Kanata v2 %}
right, i was able to give you the gift, so i should go to where everyone is now.

ufufu, you see, i made [key straps] for everyone in [oceans] and [ryuseitai]~♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata northinking %}
the straps are all matching… i can only hope it makes them happy…?
{% endbubble %}

<div class="minitalk" character="Anzu">
    <div class="minitalk-option">
        <div class="minitalk-option_header">
          I'm sure they will.

            {% bubble Kanata v2 %}
            fufu, anzu-san is kind, isn't she~? good girl, good girl…♪

            you made me happy, before i could make everyone else happy~
			{% endbubble %}

    <div class="minitalk-option">
        <div class="minitalk-option_header">
            Are they all the same?

        <div class="minitalk-option_content">
            {% bubble Kanata v2 %}
            you noticed, huh? the truth is, i had the [design] changed a bit for [ryuseitai] and [oceans].

            look, ryuseitai's straps have a [starry pattern], yes? well, the ones for oceans have a [fish pattern]…♪
			{% endbubble %}

    <div class="minitalk-option">
        <div class="minitalk-option_header">
            That's a lot of them.
        </div>
        <div class="minitalk-option_content">
            {% bubble Kanata v2 %}
            picking up [pearls] is so much fun, that i ended up retrieving a lot.

            but because of that, i was able to make [straps] for everyone. i am so excited to give it to them~
