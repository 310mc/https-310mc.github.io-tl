…oh? anzu-san, hello~

i was just talking to rei a moment ago. i asked him about the [secrets] to [leadership]~♪

i will be ryuseitai's [leader] next. so i am asking people with experience in [leadership] all sorts of things…♪

            It sounds like it'll come in handy.

            {% bubble Kanata v2 %}
            fufu. but the conversation [derailed] at one point, and we just started [chatting]~

            at least now we have [properly] confirmed where we will go next for the [mystery researchers] circle. i am so excited for that day…♪

            {% bubble Kanata v2 %}
            that may be true… but as long as i am alive, i cannot avoid [responsibilities].

            i will do my best to find out what i can do, and do it in my own way…♪

        <div class="minitalk-option_content">
            {% bubble Kanata v2 %}
            what sort of mindset to have as a [leader], [how] to [guide] anyone who will not listen to you… all kinds of things.

            but everyone in ryuseitai are good kids, so i do not think i will have an [opportunity] to make use of it. still, i do not [lose] out on keeping it in mind…♪

{% bubble Kanata v2 %}
ehe. i feel as though i took [one step forward] as a [leader]…♪

oh yes, speaking of. anzu-san is also like a [leader] for [idols], yes?

since we are talking, i would love to hear [advice] from you, if you have any~♪

            {% bubble Kanata v2 %}
            i see. you [ensure] that you listen to what others have to [say], don't you?

            chiaki is like that too, and i feel as though that sort of [leader] is very [trustworthy]. thank you for letting me know something so useful~♪

            that's true, it is nice when others keep a [promise], no matter how small.

            i would like to be a [leader] who keeps [promises], too. no, i will work hard to become that…♪

            nobody will want to follow a [leader] with no [confidence]? i see, that might be true.

            {% bubble Kanata smilesoft2 %}
            but… if there is a time you do not have [confidence] in yourself, i will not abandon you, anzu-san. please loosen yourself up a little every once in a while~♪

anzu-san, you will go meet with shinobu and tetora for [something], yes?
