I'm so happy I could meet Anzu-dono as soon as I entered ES~♪

It really makes me feel like I've truly returned home~

You see, our work at Okinawa was pretty tough this time, so…

            Ahh, you heard all about it from Morisawa-dono?

            But when we could have fun, it was truly fun. Our work was quite fulfilling, too.

            Indeed. We were able to take it easy this time, much more than the last time we were there.

            We went to souvenir shops too, so I feel quite satisfied~♪

{% bubble Shinobu smile %}
I bought souvenirs for all my friends, and Anzu-dono too.

I ended up buying quite a lot of things. Sweets, key holders, and other miscellaneous items…

Ah— My gift to you is a beauty facemask. ♪
{% endbubble %}

<div class="minitalk" character="Anzu">

        <div class="minitalk-option_header">
            Thank you.

            {% bubble Shinobu grin %}
            Heheh. I'm sure you will be surprised to see what's inside. For you see, it's a facemask with a Shisa face printed on it!

            Actually, everyone in Ryuseitai tried one, and it was quite interesting. So I decided to buy one for you, too~♪

            W-Was it a surprising choice coming from me…? I actually couldn't decide what would be good at first, and asked Isara-dono for help.

            He told me that you'd likely enjoy facemasks or something soothing, so that's how I ended up with this gift.

            Fufu, it was worth the time and effort to find the right gift for you.

            I'm sure your skin will look soft and smooth with this, Anzu-dono~♪

{% bubble Shinobu smile %}
I'm so glad you liked your souvenir, Anzu-dono…♪

Right then, I should go and hand over the other souvenirs to everyone else.

That being said, where *should* I go next?

            {% bubble Shinobu norsmile %}
            Yuuta-kun was there? Then I'll head over there.

            My souvenir for Yuuta-kun is actually something he requested me to buy… It is quite a large amount, so I'd like to give it to him as soon as possible.

            Mikejima-dono was there!? This is perfect timing, then!

            Mikejima-dono always gives me ninja merchandise, so I bought him plenty of souvenirs as repayment. Thank you for informing me~♪

            Hm, hm. Everyone in ALKALOID had tea there…

            I already passed over ALKALOID's gifts to Mayoi-dono. For some reason, he came to see me at the airport, so he was the first person I met once I returned here.
