Ah, Anzu-san. Are you going to have lunch now?

I just arrived, too… I was just wondering what to eat, so I've been looking at the menu board.

Anzu-san, have you already decided?

            One of the daily set meals, maybe.

            {% bubble Midori norsmile %}
            Ahh, the set meal with lots of spring veggies, right? I was just thinking that one looks tasty.

            I think I'll have the same, then… It sounds like it'll be a healthy meal.

            {% bubble Midori norsmile %}
            Ah, there's a meal you always have, huh? I get you. I tend to have the same food every time, too…

            It's much more comforting to just eat the meal you know is tasty, instead of a new one you've never tried yet.

            Me too. I tend to decide something while lining up in the queue, but…

            In the end, I don't choose anything in time, then go into a panic and choose something I don't actually like much… I'm betting the same will happen today.

Woah— I'm so sorry! A huge queue came up while we were chatting…!

*Sigh…* We should have lined up before talking, right… I wasted your time…

I'm so sorry for taking away your precious lunchbreak like this.

            Really? You seem so busy lately, so I thought I did something bad…

            I know this is odd coming from me, but please make sure to rest whenever you can. Your health is important…

            Thank you. I don't really have anything interesting to say, but if you're alright with talking to me, I'd be glad to have a chat.

            I'm sorry for worrying you… Ah, all I've been doing is apologizing.

            I seriously need to fix this negative side of me… I went up a school year by now, so I gotta get myself together…

{% bubble Midori norsmile %}
We finally have our food. Alright, I'll go eat over on that seat.

…Huh? Am I keeping someone waiting? No, I was just planning to eat on my own…

You'd like to eat together? I'm fine with it, but are you sure…?

            I see… True, I do feel like I haven't been able to talk to you much lately, Anzu-san.

            It's nice talking to you, so I'll be taking you up on that offer.
