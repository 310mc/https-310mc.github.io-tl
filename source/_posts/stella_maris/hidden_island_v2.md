## Chapter 6

{% note narration %}
This story has two chapters with adjusted scenes (Hidden Island 6 and 10). The <a href="/stella_maris/hidden_island" target="_blank">main translation</a> follows the story as it currently is in-game right now. The version below follows the story before it was adjusted.

<div class="msr-narration">
    <p>Several minutes later. A remote island near Okinawa’s mainland, “Hoshijima”…</p>
</div>

{% bubble Mizusaba %}
Mensooore~♪

Welcome to “Hoshijima”! The land that was once confined~♪

Right now, as long as you have permission — or really, as long as *I’m* here, it’s fine to disembark the ship, so feel free to step onto this land~…♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora shocked %}
W-Woah, this is—
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki awkward %}
Mm… I know I shouldn’t say it this way, but the place is completely in tatters, far more than expected…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori curious %}
T-There’s only ruins as far as the eye can see… What a crazy sight.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora awkward0 %}
I had no idea there was an area in our country with such an unbelievable landscape.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki norsmile %}
You could actually just turn this scenery itself into a tourist attraction… It sort of reminds me of the Gunkanjima I saw in a video before.[^1]
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata northinking %}
which was “gunkanjima” again? is it the [island] with a lot of bunnies?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki %}
I believe you’re thinking of Okunoshima, in Hiroshima.[^2] But yeah, it’s something similar to that. It’s an island that was kept hidden from the world for a long time due to various reasons.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shinobu nod %}
The sight of this scenery excites me somewhat… I’m still a boy, after all.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki grin %}
I get you. I want to explore the area.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mizusaba %}
Ah\~. The buildings could fall any moment, so don’t walk wherever you like, okay\~?

As you can see, the place is filled with ruins, and there aren’t any real facilities — not even a hospital\~. We can’t have you getting injured by accident\~.

The main island may be nearby, but not so close that we can head back there in a flash~.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki awkward %}
If the ship were to sink now, we’d end up in a typical plot for classic detective novels. Like a closed circle sort of situation.[^3]
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori worried0 %}
P-Please don’t say something so ominous… It’ll be fine, right? The ship won’t sink, right?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mizusaba %}
No worries, no worries\~. Besides, even if it did sink, we’re in a modern age where we can just phone call for a replacement to come pick us up\~.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori awkward %}
Oh, right… Phone calls should work just fine here.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shinobu frown %}
There’s still that worrisome thought we wouldn’t be able to reach a signal… Which sort of reminds me of that time Tetora-kun turned evil. It was truly tough on me to have all signals jammed—[^4]
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora worried %}
Urk— I was avoiding mentioning that ‘cuz I <em>knew</em> it’d sting to hear a remark…!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki serious %}
Let’s stop our chatter here. We didn’t come here to enjoy sightseeing — We’re technically at work right now.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki norsmile2 %}
…But, actually, that sort of thing should only be said by the current leader — Kanata.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata smileconfident %}
ah— yes, that’s right. heeey\~ you should [not] get ahead of yourselves, okay\~?

we have an important [job] to do.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki srsthinking %}
Yeah. Still, where do we even start…? Can we really restore such a ruined land like this?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shinobu worried %}
S-Surely this is too much for only us to handle—
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mizusaba %}
Mm\~. I’m sure you’re tired from the long trip, so we’ll first head over somewhere you can drop your belongings and rest\~. This island isn’t completely uninhabited, after all\~.

There’s something of a village here, where Kanata-sama’s worshippers live~.

This was a confined area before, so there are no lodging facilities like a hotel, but I negotiated with them to let us rent an unoccupied home~.

Also, all the folks from my group came together to clean the whole building for you… So, you should be able to sleep comfortably~.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki smile %}
T-That’s very kind of you. We really appreciate your thoughtfulness, Mizusaba-san.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mizusaba %}
No need to thank me. This is my job~♪

But I ask that you don’t rely on me too much.

I’m also an outsider on this island, so even if I’m well known with the Okinawan locals — I haven’t actually made many connections with the people here yet.

This is just hypothetically speaking, but for example, I might not be able to cover for you if they cause any harm to you. So you shouldn’t act without restraint~.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora yare %}
He’s talking to <em>you</em>, Morisawa-senpai. Jeez, you’re always acting like a li’l kid wherever we go, runnin’ about as soon as you can.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki surprised0 %}
H-Huhh—!? Wait, I wasn’t the one doing the scolding, but the one <em>receiving</em> the scolding!?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mizusaba %}
Hehe\~. Right then, everyone, follow me\~.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shinobu v2 %}
Fufu. I know we were just scolded for acting like tourists, but it feels as though we’re on a tour, with Mizusaba-san as our guide.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori frownshake %}
But if this were a tour, we would’ve been able to learn <em>something</em> about the place from a guide book or something… We don’t know a single thing about this island, and it’s seriously scary…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki grin2 %}
Don’t stray too far, Takamine. We may not be able to find each other again if we lose track of each other.

Here; if you’re feeling anxious, big brother will gladly hold your hand~♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori v2 %}
*…tch…*
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki surprised0 %}
He clicked his tongue!? Why!? I really was trying to be considerate, though…!?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora grin %}
Midori-kun doesn’t wanna be treated like a li’l kid either, y’know~♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shinobu curious %}
……………
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora serious %}
…? What’s up, Shinobu-kun? You seem dazed…?

Are you feelin’ exhausted from the long trip after all?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shinobu srsthinking %}
Ah, no… Mm~ Perhaps it’s simply my imagination…

But I feel as though someone is watching us—
