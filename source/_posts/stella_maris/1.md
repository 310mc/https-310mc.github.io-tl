{% bubble Midori sad2 %}

{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shinobu awkward %}
…………
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata norsmile %}
—everyone.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki %}
Ah, yes. What’s up, Kanata? I feel like we put in every bit of our effort as best as we could, but—
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata angry %}
are you even *trying?*
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki surprised0 %}
Whaa—!? I thought he looked pretty content, but he’s actually in a bad mood!?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata frown %}
that was [simply] because i was happy to sing a [song] with everyone.

truthfully, the [song] is still far from [perfection]… you all need to [brush up] more.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori sightired %}
<em>Sigh…</em>
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata serious %}
for now, please focus on how it feels to be a [fish], everyone. do you truly understand the [concept] behind this [song]?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora awkward0 %}
H-He’s genuinely angry at us…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori curious %}
Erm, by the song’s concept—
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shinobu v2 %}
I believe that this song was prepared for the commercial we’ll be filming for this job. The purpose is to increase seafood sales.

However, right now we’re simply practicing the general feel of the song, before the actual filming for the commercial.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata frown2 %}
yes. we would have been in very big trouble if this were the [real deal]. tell me, do you <em>truly</em> think a performance of this level will increase the [consumption] of [fish]?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki awkward %}
I don’t feel as though anyone was thinking of that…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori frownshake %}
Yeah… Like, since the song starts by emphasizing that “even fishies are alive”, it actually makes it <em>way</em> harder to want to eat fish—
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata norsmile %}
and that part is not one i am willing to [give up].
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki grin2 %}
Mhm! It’s wonderful to have something you aren’t willing to give up!

We, the reborn Ryuseitai, will continue to cherish that aspect![^2]
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki smilesoft %}
I know I’ve explained this many times before, but — From here on, we’ll be taking turns with the commander role[^3] for every job.

To be more precise, for each job sent to us, the most suitable member will take up the role of the commander for the duration of it.

That way, we’ll no longer be in a situation where jobs are constantly entrusted to one person, like it was to me — and it should immensely expand our range of activities in the unit.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora yare %}
But in terms of the agency, they seem to want Morisawa-senpai to constantly be the leader, though. They want us to only perform “hero of justice”-type activities like we used to in Yumenosaki.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki smileconfident %}
Yeah. But after going through many ups and downs, we decided to oppose the agency’s policy.[^4]

It’s pointless if only I ever get to make my dreams come true. No, not just that — I had never intended to make Ryuseitai into a tool— into nothing but a scapegoat for my own personal dreams.

Naturally, everyone has the right to be happy!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata v2 %}
yees~ it is my turn to be [happy] this time~♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora serious %}
Ossu. Except, while Midori-kun, Shinobu-kun, and I got to experience being the commander lots’a times already, Shinkai-senpai was the only one who stubbornly didn’t take on the role ‘til now.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata scold %}
hey~! you should call me “taichou”[^5] right now!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora awkward0 %}
Ah— I’m real sorry. I’ll be careful from now on.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata v2 %}
yes\~♪ good boy\~♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki curious %}
Mm… Kanata looks to be motivated as well, and he seems to have understood and accepted the concept behind the reborn Ryuseitai, so—

Why did you stubbornly refuse to be the commander up until now?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata northinking %}
mm~ it just happened, i think?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki awkward %}
It just happened…?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata norsmile %}
the [children] had far more [dissatisfaction] built up from the [course] of [events] up until now than i ever had—

so i was fine with [postponing] my opportunity until much later.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora serious %}
Shinkai-senpai…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata smilesoft %}
but. it [bothers] me to think you may see it as me [slacking off], so i will work hard as the [commander] this time.

i will do everything in my power to guide everyone as ryuseitai’s [leader]!

now then, what are your [catchphrases] when i am [commander]~?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki smile %}
The red-fleshed king! Tuna![^6]
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori norsmile %}
Bears love us, too! Salmon![^7]
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora fist %}
We may be poisonous, but we’re tasty! Puffer fish![^8]
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shinobu fist %}
In auspicious times, sea bream![^9]
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata smileconfident %}
and~ with enough effort, we can be eaten as *kamaboko!* mr. [shark]![^10]
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki grin2 %}
With the five of us together! We are “Fish Ryuseitai”!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata v2 %}
Kya-kya! ☆ Kya-kya! ☆
