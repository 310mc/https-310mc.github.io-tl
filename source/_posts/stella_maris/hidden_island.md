## Chapter 1

{% note narration %}
**Chapter TL Note:** The chapter title “hidden island” is written in hiragana only, so I’ve written the title in lowercase letters, similar to how Kanata’s speech quirk (speaks in hiragana only) is written in my translations.

{% bubble Chiaki grin2 %}
Alright! Time-out strategy!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata smileconfident %}
okay, i will allow a [time-out].
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki norsmile2 %}
Sengoku, Takamine, Nagumo, come with me. Let’s discuss what we’ll be doing together from here on.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora norsmile %}
Ossu. We need to talk this over ASAP.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata curious %}
oh\~? am i the only one being [left out]\~?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki %}
Sorry. We’ll be done shortly, so please bear with it for now.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shinobu worried %}
Morisawa-dono…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki smilesoft %}
Don’t make that face, Sengoku. It’ll be alright. We can’t be the ones in the wrong here.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora awkward0 %}
It sounds like you’re tellin’ that to yourself more than anyone else…?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori sad2 %}
This is starting to make me think that the concept of changing leaders for every job really <em>is</em> impractical—… It was a tough time when it was my turn, too…[^1]
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora nod %}
But your turn was a huge success, wasn’t it, Midori-kun?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori frownshake %}
Only in terms of the outcome… I honestly never wanna do it again…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shinobu v2 %}
However, I feel as though we’ve managed to have excellent success thus far. Although, the agency has remained silent the whole time, which is a little scary—
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora serious %}
That’s ‘cuz we’ve been regularly producing results. The agency can’t make complaints over somethin’ like that, right?

And so far, it seems that our fans are accepting how we are right now.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki awkward %}
They do seem a little bewildered, though, since we changed courses so suddenly before providing them with a proper explanation.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora smileconfident %}
But even then, as we continue to approach things in a new way, I feel like they’re gradually coming to understand how we operate.

I can sense an increase in the amount of fans gladly looking forward to seeing who’ll be leader next.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki norsmile %}
Yeah. I’d like to ride that pleasant wave if possible, and correct our trajectory after having fallen down rock bottom for a period of time.

No, in fact— I want to make a huge comeback here from the brink of death.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora smilesoft %}
Ossu. I split from Ryuseitai for a while, even if it was only for an infiltration mission[^2], so — I know this’ll sound weird comin’ from me, but… We all feel the exact same way.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki norsmile2 %}
We should avoid rushing at all costs, though. Let’s regain our radiance, slowly but surely.

We aren’t in a tokusatsu show with a running time of thirty minutes per episode only.

It’s impossible to solve every little thing and reach a happy ending in one single shot, like turning the tables with a new form change or secret weapon.

We have no choice but to chip away at our problem in this reality, steadily and carefully.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki serious %}
It’s through this recent policy to steadily work hard together, that Kanata was tasked with the commander role this time, but—

What do you guys think about it, frankly?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shinobu sightired %}
I think it’s pretty freaking bad.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori worried0 %}
Ah— Shinobu-kun, you thought so, too? I felt the same way, but I just couldn’t get myself to say anything about it when Shinkai-senpai looked like he was having <em>so</em> much fun…!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki grin2 %}
There’s no need to hold back just because we’re your seniors, y’know? Healthy relationships can only be formed when we can point out each other’s shortcomings without hesitation!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora yare %}
Aight, then I’d like to mention this upfront: Morisawa-senpai, you stink, so please try not to get near me.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki surprised0 %}
That’s so mean!? Eh? Eh!? Takamine keeps criticizing me for stinking of sweat, so I’ve been really careful, though…!?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora frown %}
It’s the amount of deodorant you use — it’s <em>way</em> too much. Everything’s so extreme and excessive with you.

Deodorants are supposed to suppress the smell of sweat, not to numb other people’s senses, ‘kay?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki frownshake %}
M-Mm! I’ll make sure that I use the right amount!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shinobu grin %}
Fufu. Morisawa-dono, what people say to you weighs on your mind… You are surprisingly delicate, aren’t you?[^3]
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki frustrated %}
I really am! I’m a delicate guy, like a fruit that rots from wherever it’s touched!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori serious %}
……Morisawa Durian Chiaki.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki shocked %}
Don’t call me by the name of a stinky fruit in a whisper! That’s bullying! There’s bullying taking place in Ryuseitai…!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori serious %}
Durians are also delicious fruits, y’know… It’s the king of fruits…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki smile %}
Oh! So what you were trying to say is that I may have my weak points, but I have my strong points too, Takamine! You sure are bad at compliments!
{% endbubble %}

## Chapter 2

{% bubble Chiaki frown %}
Let’s return to the topic at hand. I only first became aware of it through this job, but — Kanata is extremely bad at leading people from a higher position.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shinobu northinking %}
I believe Shinkai-dono was the president of the Marine Life Club when he was in Yumenosaki, though—
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki serious %}
Do you recall any proper achievements the Marine Life Club accomplished as a club?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shinobu awkward %}
Now that you mention it, I could never understand what on earth they were doing there… Perhaps that isn’t something to be said by someone from the Ninja Association, though.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki frown2 %}
Exactly, that’s the problem: We can barely understand what on earth he’s doing.

Everything Kanata says is so vague and floaty, that we can’t at all tell what he actually wants to do.

The only reason we came to know that our job is for a commercial filming is thanks to Sengoku, who ran all over the place and surveyed everyone for information.

Kanata, on the other hand, told us nothing past, “it is a fish job!”.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora frown %}
It feels like he’s expecting us to use our comprehension skills to understand each and every instruction, too… I definitely remember a time in Yumenosaki when Shinkai-senpai guided us as a coach, though…[^4]
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki frown %}
Back then, I was the one who set up the fundamentals. Kanata simply just had to compare that with your performances and fill in the lacking areas.

In other words, he excels as an assistant, but the very moment Kanata is the corepoint, it’s impossible to understand what’s going on.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki sighdrop %}
…What are we to do?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora yare %}
Well, I mean… We’ve got no choice but to handle it somehow. It’s pretty nerve-wracking not knowing where we’re headed, though.

After all, we follow the fundamental concept of the reborn Ryuseitai, and that is: The member who takes up the commander role is in charge of everything, and the rest of the members follow his command.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki frownshake %}
Mm… It’s worrisome, but we can’t go back on our word now. We’ve only just decided to work abiding by this direction.

It also isn’t cool to retract one’s statement right after saying something so brave.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki serious %}
Plus, our job this time is small-scaled; it’s only a single commercial filming. Of course, that doesn’t in <em>any</em> way mean we should cut corners, but—

In the worst case that we cause an accident and make mistakes, we should be able to minimize damages.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki norsmile2 %}
And it’s by repeating such mistakes, using them as fuel to learn and grow, that even Kanata will one day become a splendid comma—
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata smilesoft %}
okaay, [time-out] is over~♪

unfortunately, it is [time] for us to stop here, so come on everyone, let us [depart]!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki curious %}
D-Depart? What are you talking about?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata norsmile %}
huh? did i not [explain] this to all of you?

the [commercial filming] is located in [okinawa].
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki surprised %}
*Okinawa!?* We did go to Okinawa for the SS qualifying round last year, but—[^5]
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata nod %}
yes. it is due to the [relationships] i made during that time that i was able to receive this [job].
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki worried %}
Wouldn’t it have been nice to tell us something as important as that much earlier? Don’t you know we have our own planning and mental preparation to do beforehand!?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora awkward0 %}
Uumyu, we’re going to Okinawa…? It was fine durin’ the SS qualifying round and all, but it’s tricky for me to show my face now, when I’ve had connections to Crimson Production before.[^2]
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki fist %}
You have to think in the opposite direction, Nagumo! Consider it a chance to sort out all the things you left undone back then!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora norsmile %}
Ossu. I’m clumsy like Morisawa-senpai, so I’ve got a lotta things I inadvertently left unsettled. I gotta make sure to pay off my debts.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata v2 %}
then it is time to [depart]\~! let’s go\~♪[^6]
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori worried0 %}
Shinkai-senpai’s strangely in high spirits… You let us have so many opportunities up until now, but if you’re acting this way, does it mean you actually wanted to be the leader deep down, after all…?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata grin %}
ah, no~ i do not really [like] to be high and mighty like a [king] or [god].

but this time around, there is something i am [looking forward] to.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori v3 %}
………?
{% endbubble %}

## Chapter 3

{% img /img/es/eventstory/stellamaris/p1_3.jpg %}

<div class="msr-narration">
    <p>The next morning. In Okinawa…</p>
</div>

{% bubble Kanata v2 %}
we have arrived~♪

everyone, mensooore\~♪[^7] welcome to [okinawa]\~!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki awkward %}
Are you a local now?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora smilesoft %}
Ahaha. To be fair, all of us have a pretty deep connection to this place at this point.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori sighdrop %}
Uu~ I know Okinawa’s just got that kinda climate, but… it feels like the hottest days of summer here even though it’s still spring… My body’s starting to act up a little…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shinobu sightired %}
I know what you mean~… I also tend to feel unwell by the slightest change in environment, so I have to be careful.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori sighfrown %}
Yeah… I brought over-the-counter medicine with me, so let me know if you’re low on anything… Then again, it’s probably not a good idea to share medicine much…

I don’t even think the other three can be thoughtful about this sort of thing, since I bet they can live in any environment just fine, so…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shinobu norsmile %}
Ah, to one’s surprise, Morisawa-dono is quite sensitive to changes in environment as well, as he was once a sickly child.[^8]

In fact, he has always provided me support every time I was on the verge of falling ill.

But I appreciate the thought, Midori-kun. It really makes me happy.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shinobu awkward %}
You see, I was continuously participating in a harsh show called “2x2” up until recently… And for the whole duration, my troublesome friend made me go through a lot with his whims.[^9]

So a friend simply showing concern for me is enough to move my heart.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori sighfrown %}
Wasn’t that a 2wink show or something… Making our Shinobu-kun miserable is unforgivable…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shinobu sigh %}
Ah, no, the show itself was quite fun and fulfilling until the very end.

But as one would expect, it was pretty tough to constantly be invited as a semi-regular participant in a show I hadn’t planned to be in so often…

So it was a little out of my capacity… My stamina has completely dried up thanks to that, and I feel somewhat exhausted.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori worried %}
If you feel worn out, how about Tetora-kun and I take turns carrying you…?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shinobu worried %}
No, no! I’m not a baby, you know~?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora curious %}
Heeey\~! What’re you two talkin’ about together\~?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora serious %}
We gotta hurry a li’l. It seems like this isn’t our final destination, and we’ll have to get on a ship to make it there—

But if we’re late to board it, we’ll have to wait a whole day for another one to hitch a ride.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori frownshake %}
What… Where the heck are we going…?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shinobu serious %}
Is it a remote island that rarely has visitors?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora awkward0 %}
Uu~myu… As usual, everythin’ Shinkai-senpai says is too vague and floaty to really know what it is.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shinobu srsthinking %}
While that is one of Shinkai-dono’s charms—… I think about this a lot, but is he truly alright carrying out his daily life activities like this…?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora norsmile %}
We’ll just have to make sure we support him then — as much as he has for us, at the very least. Ossu.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori serious %}
Yeah… Shinkai-senpai is our mascot character[^10]… We need to protect him at all costs.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata norsmile %}
…? what is wrong, everyone? are you tired from the [long trip] after all~?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki fist %}
You guys are so half-hearted despite your young age! C’mon now, you’ve got this! Muster all your energy from the depths of your stomach…!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora frown %}
I think ‘bout this a lot too, but — Our seniors are <em>way</em> too energetic.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shinobu awkward %}
Ahaha. The fact that there was a time when even our over-energetic seniors lost their energy truly shows how abnormal the situation was for Ryuseitai.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shinobu smile %}
But right now, their energy is starting to return, at least. The goofy atmosphere that Ryuseitai had in the past, too.

Just that alone makes me happy. We should be content with that, I’m sure.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata curious %}
mm\~…? mm\~…?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki curious %}
…? What have you been looking around for, Kanata? Did you drop something? Would you like to look for it together?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata serious %}
no, erm. we are supposed to have someone [pick us up] from here—

he will lead us to the [place] by [boat]… but i do not [see him] anywhere, even though we are supposed to have met him [by now].
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shinobu northinking %}
Mm~ I did hear something about Okinawans having a different sense of time from us, as they live in a paradise-like environment.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora serious %}
Apparently, it’s like that in other countries, too. If anything, it’s only Japanese people who’re way too punctual when it comes to time.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori norsmile %}
Heheh. In that case, with how floaty Shinkai-senpai is about everything, he might actually be the universal standard.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki surprised0 %}
Mm—? Y-You guys…!?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shinobu surprised %}
Hweh? What’s the matter all of a sudden, Morisawa-dono?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki worried %}
B-B-Behind you! There’s someone standing right behind you guys!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shinobu curious %}
Eh…?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata v2 %}
ahh, hello~♪

ah, no— how do people [greet] each other in [okinawa] again…? Ermm, haitai~?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mizusaba unknown %}
Haitai~…♪

But no worries, there’s no need to speak in Okinawan dialect with me~. We also like to use the mainland’s language thanks to our westernized “Ani-sama’s”[^11] influence.

In fact, kids might not even understand you if you talk in Okinawan dialect~…♪
{% endbubble %}

{% img /img/es/eventstory/stellamaris/tetoraorigcg.jpg %}

{% bubble Tetora surprised0 %}
……!

<th>(Huh!? Wh-What’s with this person…? From how the two’re talking, I think he’s the person Shinkai-senpai was looking for, but—)</th>

<th>(He’s *huge!* Midori-kun’s pretty tall already, yet he’s *two heads* taller than him!? It’s like the perspective’s gone wonky all’a sudden!)</th>

<th>(A-A giant…? Is he seriously human like us?)</th>
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mizusaba unknown %}
Oh wow? Some of you seem scared…?

Sorry\~. I’m not scary, really\~. I won’t eat you up\~…♪[^12]
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata norsmile %}
yes, this is the person who will [guide] us to our job’s [location] — ermm, what was your [name] again?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mizusaba %}
Friends and family call me “Mizusaba”\~.[^13] I’m pretty huge, after all\~. Fufufu\~♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori curious %}
Mizusaba…?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata smilesoft %}
it refers to the [whale sharkie]~ [okinawans] call it that.[^14]
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori norsmile %}
That’s Shinkai-senpai for you; he knows so much about fish.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mizusaba %}
Mhm. Kanata-sama is what you’d call an erudite\~. We all respect him\~.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori curious %}
Kanata-“sama”…?[^15]
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mizusaba %}
Ah, wait— We don’t have the time to chat right now… The ship is ready, so let’s hurry to the harbor and hop on board~.

We can talk all we like once we’re settled~…♪
{% endbubble %}

## Chapter 4

{% img /img/es/eventstory/stellamaris/p1_4.jpg %}

<div class="msr-narration">
    <p>Nearly an hour later. Onboard the ship to the location…</p>
</div>

{% bubble Tetora srsthinking %}
Hm, hm.

So to summarize — Mizusaba-san is a worshipper of Shinkai-senpai’s uh, religion…? The same one he mentioned before, right?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mizusaba %}
Ah\~. I’m not, actually\~? We’re pretty influential in Okinawa’s main island, so we act as mediators — the bridge between the local worshippers and Kanata-sama\~…♪

The worshippers don’t get involved with other people much, after all\~. Without a point of contact, the conversation won’t get anywhere\~, such a bother, right\~…♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora curious %}
<th>(Mm~… Mizusaba-san may look intimidating, but he’s actually a pretty calm, kind person, huh?)</th>

<th>(But he’s just so huge that my instincts acted up as soon as he was in close range.)</th>
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora smile %}
<th>(Heheh. I kinda recall feeling somethin’ similar with Shinkai-senpai when I first talked to him. He’s pretty big, and his voice has a peculiar frequency when he speaks, so I didn’t think he was a human being like me.)</th>

<th>(He seemed more like a strange, mysterious monster at first.)</th>[^16]

<th>(That just sounds funny to me now, though — ‘Cuz Shinkai-senpai is actually harmless. I’d actually say he’s even kinder than ordinary people.)</th>
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki northinking %}
Hm. Speaking of which, Kanata made contact with those worshippers during the SS qualifying round, didn’t he?[^5]
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata smilesoft %}
yes. if we are to consider my household as the [client] fish, like a [giant moray eel], then the [okinawans] would be the [cleaner fish], like a [bluestreak cleaner wrasse].
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shinobu serious %}
Main house, primary line. Branch house, supporting line.[^17]
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki awkward %}
Thank you for the translation.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki srsthinking %}
If I’m not mistaken, the worshippers that split into their own branch a very long time ago advanced a religion of their own in Okinawa, right?

But even then, those from the supporting line consider Kanata as their god as well, so—
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata norsmile %}
yes. though i am no longer a [god], of course.

but even so, there is no way i can abandon [those] who adore and worship me as [one]—

so after the qualifying round was over, i have been staying in [contact] with those [worshippers] every now and then.

after all, i had [promised] them that i would [help] them if they are ever in trouble.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki norsmile %}
During the qualifying round, the reason we managed to achieve victory in the ruthless battlefield here in Okinawa was also thanks to the cooperation and support of the locals.[^5]

We ought to repay that favor, at the very least.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora yare %}
Ossu. Though, thanks to that, I ended up getting dispatched as a spy after they concluded Ryuseitai likely has a lotta influence ‘round Okinawa.[^2]
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki smilesoft %}
That’s because it’s impossible for everything to have a 100% positive influence.

There’s no such thing as the 100% perfect right answer. What’s important is looking at the outcome of your choice, then making full use of the positive effects that it brought, while recovering from the negative effects as fast as possible.

That’s why it’s always important to change strategies when necessary, and be flexible with your approaches.

Those are the fundamentals of basketball.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori curious %}
You were talking about basketball?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shinobu nod %}
He’s talking about “overhaul” through “basketball”.[^18]
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki grin2 %}
That was a good one! Sengoku, you win one million zabuton cushions!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shinobu awkward %}
If you were to stack <em>that</em> many cushions on top of each other, it would exceed the Earth’s atmosphere.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki grin2 %}
And that’s how we’ll become stars! Fuhahahaha…!! ☆
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata serious %}
ermm, may i get back on [topic]?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori sightired %}
Please, by all means. There’ll be no end in sight if an idiot’s nonsense is encouraged.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata smileconfident %}
fufufu\~ i like this sort of thing too, though\~♪

but yes, so. since ss, i have been occasionally performing some [activities] with the [okinawan] people.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shinobu smilesoft %}
I heard the gist of that before.

I’ve basically been managing everyone’s schedule in Ryuseitai, as nobody tries to do it themselves, so that is how I know.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki grin2 %}
Mhm! Letting Sengoku take care of everything will guarantee us no problems!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shinobu awkward %}
I would rather you don’t rely on me so much for that~… I’m quite feeble, so it will eventually crush me.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shinobu srsthinking %}
In any case, after having performed various activities, Shinkai-dono has gained a reputation within Okinawa.

Perhaps this is not the best expression, but it seems like at this point, he is almost treated as a god here.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki frown %}
<em>That</em> again…? I thought he stopped behaving as if he’s a god?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata nod2 %}
ahh, well~ it is a force of [habit], you see~
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki awkward %}
Force of *habit…*?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki serious %}
Well, either way, I’m starting to see the picture.

That’s why Kanata once again received a request from the Okinawan people— or rather, from the worshippers who believe in him, right?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori yare %}
They’re using him for their own convenience, aren’t they… I think it’s fine to refuse to do anything you don’t wanna do, y’know?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata smile %}
oh, no, no~ it is not like i do not want to [do] it~?

it makes me very [happy] to be [useful] to others.

it is possible that my [senses] are [different] from all of yours, but…

the [worshippers] also simply believe in an [uncommon religion], that is all.

they do not cause any [harm], nor do they bear any [sins].
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki norsmile %}
Of course. Hate the sin, not the sinner. If they aren’t doing any harm, then they’re also citizens with human rights, who deserve to be protected.

In fact, I hope that our— or rather, *Kanata’s* activities, can clear off the prejudices and misunderstandings those kinds of people face, even if only a little.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata norsmile %}
yes. [mikejima] might have a different [opinion] here, but… i have [high hopes] for something like that.
{% endbubble %}

## Chapter 5

{% bubble Chiaki northinking %}
That being said, I’m a little confused about the details again.

Our job this time is filming for a commercial, right? Why did the Okinawan worshippers, of what I’ll tentatively call the Kanata Religion, request for that?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata norsmile %}
ahh… to be more precise, the [commercial filming] is one of the [strategic steps] i will be taking to reach the [final destination].

in other words, it is how i [assume] we will reach the final point—
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki curious %}
……?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata norsmile %}
mm. the [worshippers’ request] is to perform a [restoration] of their land.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki grin2 %}
Restoration of their land? As in, to rejuvenate the area?

In that case, that’s exactly an idol’s area of expertise, which means, quite a typical job for an idol! We’re always working hard to liven up the unenergetic land and its people!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora serious %}
Actually, if it needs restoration, does that mean it’s in decline right now?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata serious %}
hm, rather than decline… well, i think it will be very [obvious] when we arrive [there].

you see, the [land] those [worshippers] live in was actually a [confined area] for a very long time.[^5]

in particular, they disliked the thought of [idols] getting involved.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora curious %}
…? Why were they against that?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata yare %}
the reason is [unknown]. it seems as though something happened in the [olden days].
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata smilesoft %}
but. it appears that as the [generations] have changed, even that [land] became accepting of [idol culture].

so they want to match the times, and [allow] access to their [closed land] from now on. then, they want to make the [land] be reborn as a place where everyone can live with [smiles] on their faces.

that was their request.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki curious %}
I-It’s a much more large-scaled request than I expected. It’s exactly what you’d call “rejuvenating the land”, huh.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora awkward0 %}
I really thought we were just doing a commercial filming, though…?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata norsmile %}
we will also film a [commercial], yes\~ if we [advertise] the [land] and let people know “it’s not scary, it’s actually fun\~”, there will be more [residents], yes?

gathering [people] and [things] is bound to lead to the [restoration].
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki srsthinking %}
That’s true… A restoration is out of the question if you don’t even have the human resources and materials for it. It would be an unreasonable request to make only one person to rehabilitate a land — It’s simply impossible for an individual to manage it alone.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata frown %}
that is exactly why the [worshippers] are having trouble. they want to do something for the land, but they do not know what to do.

that is why they asked for my [help].

and i have been trying to do [whatever] i [can] up until now. like performing [ceremonies] and cleansing the [land].
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shinobu northinking %}
Ahh, yes. Apparently, a cleansing ceremony to prepare for construction was performed. I heard something like that at the end of the previous school year.[^19]

Huh, so that’s how that story links to our current situation…

I recall hearing that Tori-kun’s unit plan to create an ES branch in a land that had been untouchable up until then.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata norsmile %}
yes. and to match with that, we will be livening up the [land] around that branch.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki norsmile %}
Ah, something like, “we’re making a new shinkansen train station, so let’s draw a lot of people to the market street around the station”.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata smileconfident %}
yes, something like that~♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora awkward0 %}
I finally understand the full story… Shinkai-senpai seriously talks in such a floaty way, that I couldn’t tell at all what he wanted to do.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata norsmile %}
i am sorry~ when i was young, i only ever fulfilled my [role], and never really did anything that i [wanted] to do.

so i do not know how to explain what i [want] to do properly.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata smilesoft2 %}
in the end, i simply want to make everyone [happy]. and the reason for that is because everyone made <em>me</em> [happy].

in other words, i am [repaying] the [kind favor].[^20] fufufu~♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki smile %}
How admirable! Those feelings are what matter most! The good you do for others is good you do yourself!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata smilesoft %}
yes. that is exactly what [ryuseitai] is about — i will always believe in that.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mizusaba %}
Have you all sorted out everything~…?

Because we’re about to arrive, so… start preparing your belongings to make sure you don’t forget anything, okay~?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora v2 %}
Oh— We’re already there? That was faster than I thought.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mizusaba %}
It isn’t that far from the main island, actually\~. But its existence was ignored for such a long time, that it can’t even be found on a map\~♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki %}
Hm. If it isn’t that far from Okinawa, then transportation will be easily accessible. It would genuinely be possible to liven up the place, exactly like a market street around a train station.

We should be able to make something similar to local shops that Okinawa visitors can frequently come by and see.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mizusaba %}
Mhm. That would be ideal, but it might still be a little difficult at this point~…?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki curious %}
What do you mean?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mizusaba %}
You’ll understand when you see it yourselves, but… Our destination, or rather, the island that you will be restoring—

That star island, “Hoshijima”, is in immeasurable ruins.
{% endbubble %}

## Chapter 6

{% img /img/es/eventstory/stellamaris/p1_6.jpg %}

<div class="msr-narration">
    <p>Several minutes later. A remote island near Okinawa’s mainland, “Hoshijima”…</p>
</div>

{% bubble Mizusaba %}
Mensooore~♪

Welcome to “Hoshijima”! The land that was once confined~♪

Right now, as long as you have permission — or really, as long as *I’m* here, it’s fine to disembark the ship, so feel free to step onto this land~…♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora shocked %}
W-Woah, this is—
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki awkward %}
Mm… I know I shouldn’t say it this way, but the place is completely in tatters, far more than expected…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori curious %}
T-There’s only ruins as far as the eye can see… What a crazy sight.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora awkward0 %}
I had no idea there was an area in our country with such an unbelievable landscape.[^21]
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shinobu nod %}
The sight of this scenery excites me somewhat… I’m still a boy, after all.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki grin %}
I get you. I want to explore the area.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mizusaba %}
Ah\~. The buildings could fall any moment, so don’t walk wherever you like, okay\~?

As you can see, the place is filled with ruins, and there aren’t any real facilities — not even a hospital\~. We can’t have you getting injured by accident\~.

The main island may be nearby, but not so close that we can head back there in a flash~.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki awkward %}
If the ship were to sink now, we’d end up in a typical plot for classic detective novels. Like a closed circle sort of situation.[^22]
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori worried0 %}
P-Please don’t say something so ominous… It’ll be fine, right? The ship won’t sink, right?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mizusaba %}
No worries, no worries\~. Besides, even if it did sink, we’re in a modern age where we can just phone call for a replacement to come pick us up\~.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori awkward %}
Oh, right… Phone calls should work just fine here.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shinobu frown %}
There’s still that worrisome thought we wouldn’t be able to reach a signal… Which sort of reminds me of that time Tetora-kun turned evil. It was truly tough on me to have all signals jammed—[^2]
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora worried %}
Urk— I was avoiding mentioning that ‘cuz I <em>knew</em> it’d sting to hear a remark…!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki serious %}
Let’s stop our chatter here. We didn’t come here to enjoy sightseeing — We’re technically at work right now.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki norsmile2 %}
…But, actually, that sort of thing should only be said by the current leader — Kanata.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata smileconfident %}
ah— yes, that’s right. heeey\~ you should [not] get ahead of yourselves, okay\~?

we have an important [job] to do.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki srsthinking %}
Yeah. Still, where do we even start…? Can we really restore such a ruined land like this?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shinobu worried %}
S-Surely this is too much for only us to handle—
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mizusaba %}
Mm\~. I’m sure you’re tired from the long trip, so we’ll first head over somewhere you can drop your belongings and rest\~. This island isn’t completely uninhabited, after all\~.

There’s something of a village here, where Kanata-sama’s worshippers live~.

This was a confined area before, so there are no lodging facilities like a hotel, but I negotiated with them to let us rent an unoccupied home~.

Also, all the folks from my group came together to clean the whole building for you… So, you should be able to sleep comfortably~.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki smile %}
T-That’s very kind of you. We really appreciate your thoughtfulness, Mizusaba-san.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mizusaba %}
No need to thank me. This is my job~♪

But I ask that you don’t rely on me too much.

I’m also an outsider on this island, so even if I’m well known with the Okinawan locals — I haven’t actually made many connections with the people here yet.

This is just hypothetically speaking, but for example, I might not be able to cover for you if they cause any harm to you. So you shouldn’t act without restraint~.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora yare %}
He’s talking to <em>you</em>, Morisawa-senpai. Jeez, you’re always acting like a li’l kid wherever we go, runnin’ about as soon as you can.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki surprised0 %}
H-Huhh—!? Wait, I wasn’t the one doing the scolding, but the one <em>receiving</em> the scolding!?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mizusaba %}
Hehe\~. Right then, everyone, follow me\~.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shinobu v2 %}
Fufu. I know we were just scolded for acting like tourists, but it feels as though we’re on a tour, with Mizusaba-san as our guide.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori frownshake %}
But if this were a tour, we would’ve been able to learn <em>something</em> about the place from a guide book or something… We don’t know a single thing about this island, and it’s seriously scary…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki grin2 %}
Don’t stray too far, Takamine. We may not be able to find each other again if we lose track of each other.

Here; if you’re feeling anxious, big brother will gladly hold your hand~♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori v2 %}
*…tch…*
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki surprised0 %}
He clicked his tongue!? Why!? I really was trying to be considerate, though…!?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora grin %}
Midori-kun doesn’t wanna be treated like a li’l kid either, y’know~♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shinobu curious %}
……………
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora serious %}
…? What’s up, Shinobu-kun? You seem dazed…?

Are you feelin’ exhausted from the long trip after all?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shinobu srsthinking %}
Ah, no… Mm~ Perhaps it’s simply my imagination…

But I feel as though someone is watching us—
{% endbubble %}

## Chapter 7

{% img /img/es/eventstory/stellamaris/p1_7.jpg %}

<div class="msr-narration">
    <p>Several minutes later. At the lodging accommodation for Ryuseitai — An unoccupied house in the outskirts of Hoshjima Village…</p>
</div>

{% bubble Mizusaba %}
Right, we’ve arrived~♪

For the time being, you’ll all be living here until you’ve finished the first few steps of your job~.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki smilesoft %}
Thank you for guiding us, Mizusaba-san. Ahh, we can finally take a breather.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shinobu awkward %}
Ahaha. Not only did we need to travel for a long time, but we were also completely thrown into an unknown environment, so… I strangely feel exhausted after such a stressful journey.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori norsmile %}
But this is a surprisingly decent-looking building… We should actually be able to rest here for real…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shinobu v2 %}
Right~? I was worried about where we were headed at first, as we had only come across ruins on our way.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki v2 %}
It seems like the village in the center of this island is generally livable, even if the buildings are old.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora v2 %}
Yeah, they did mention that it was just a confined area, not a deserted island.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori curious %}
Honestly, I don’t really know what confined areas actually are, but they’re basically places that are off-limits, right…? So why are people living here in the first place…?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki northinking %}
I’m not sure if saying “the island’s native people” is the right wording here, but I assume the residents are an exception?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora curious %}
I wonder what sorta people live here, on an island full’a ruins…?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mizusaba %}
They’re pretty ordinary people, really — It’s just that they believe in a unique religion\~. They also had connections with the main island back when Hoshijima was still confined\~.

My grandpa was the point of contact back then, and he’d sometimes ship any basic needs over by boat~.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki frown %}
That makes sense; it doesn’t seem possible at all to live here without someone supplying the bare necessities. On our way here, I saw a minimal amount of farm fields.

Even if they caught fish for food, it still didn’t seem enough to stay self-sufficient.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora serious %}
Despite that, the buildings in the village look legit and clean.

They still have to buy basic supplies too, though, so it really makes me wonder how the people of this island make money here…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki frustrated %}
For that, since they’re worshippers of the tentatively named Kanata Religion, they collect donations—
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora yare %}
I’m tryna say that those worshippers don’t seem to have any money, either.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata smilesoft %}
mm. it seems that a [long time] ago, they formed a [contract] with a [higher-up]—

which allowed them to be under a [system] that periodically provides them [money].

that appears to be why the people on this [island] can live fairly [comfortably] without a job.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata yare %}
but, it is a little bit of an [unhealthy] lifestyle, so to speak…

after all, if you are to count on someone else for [money], then you will be [wiped out] as soon as that person has a [change of heart].

so in hopes of avoiding a money drought, we need to help these people be capable of earning [money] on their own.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki srsthinking %}
And that’s another reason why we need to rejuvenate the land, correct? They’ve been living on that sort of financial benefit for a long time, so it’s likely that none of them know how to do business and such.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata norsmile %}
yes. even if we call over [tourists] to visit, no profit will be made without any [shops] set up.

and it is not like we can live here forever, either, yes?

we need to arrange an [environment] where the people here can live [independently] without us.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori curious %}
Shinkai-senpai is talking about a super serious topic…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata glare %}
i am <em>always</em> [serious], though~?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mizusaba %}
Everyone\~? I prepared tea and confections for you, so feel free to help yourselves\~♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki shocked %}
Ahh—! I’m so sorry! Forgive me for not helping out…!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mizusaba %}
No worries, no worries. The guests should just make themselves at home~♪

I’ll prepare a proper meal for all of you, as well\~. I’m sure you’re starving by now, right? I’ll treat you all to local cuisine\~.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki smile %}
Okay! I’m so sorry for the trouble, we’re in your care today! C’mon everyone! You should show your respect, too!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora grin %}
Ossu! Thank you very much! We’re in your care today…!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mizusaba %}
Yes, yes, so you are~…♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki v2 %}
…Mizusaba-san is surprisingly a kind person, isn’t he?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori norsmile %}
Right? Not gonna lie though, I did freak out at first ‘cause he looked so intimidating.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora curious %}
It’s ‘cuz of his height… Man, I’m jealous. What do I gotta eat to grow that big?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata smilesoft %}
would tetora like to grow big, too~?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora v2 %}
Ossu, bigger means stronger.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shinobu awkward %}
Well, we are still in our growth period, so I have hopes that we will grow bigger eventually…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shinobu sightired %}
Uuu~ I’ve practically given up on trying to grow taller, though…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki fist %}
Don’t give up, Sengoku! Your dream will come true!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori norsmile %}
I’d rather you never grow bigger, Shinobu-kun… The smaller, the cuter…♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shinobu worried %}
Yuuta-kun said the same thing to me… But I’m not some kind of pet, you know~?
{% endbubble %}

## Chapter 8

{% bubble Chiaki norsmile %}
Heheh. As nice as it is to chat, let’s discuss what we’ll do from here on out while we have the time. We wouldn’t want the day to end as nothing but a sightseeing trip.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata frown %}
that sort of thing should actually be said by <em>me</em>, the leader, don’t you think?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki awkward %}
Mm. Sorry, I’m meddling too much.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata smileconfident %}
no, no, i appreciate the help while i am still getting used to these things.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata curious %}
mm, alright. let’s see… …what should we do? what are we supposed to do here?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora worried %}
Why do you sound so unreliable!? You’re the commander this time, Shinkai-senpai, so you gotta be the one to decide what we do to <em>some</em> extent, y’know~?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata norsmile %}
yes… erm, our [goal]— or rather, the [request] we received is to [restore] this [land].
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki %}
In other words, to rejuvenate the area. We’ll turn this peculiar island into a place that can support itself and develop.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shinobu curious %}
Erm. This has been on my mind for a while, but — What exactly do you mean when you say “to restore”?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata serious %}
…? what do you mean?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shinobu northinking %}
Restoration indicates bringing life to a land that was once developed but had turned to ruins, correct?

For example, the restoration of a land struck by disaster and such…

Therefore, does that mean that this land was also once a developed area?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shinobu frown %}
Ah, erm, but perhaps there was no deeper meaning in phrasing the request in that way…?

Still, as someone who works as the secretary of the Student Council, I am extremely mindful of the use of such words.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mizusaba %}
Sorry to cut into your conversation, but yes, that’s what restoration means here~.

I heard from my grandpa that in the olden days, this land was pretty well-developed, for reasons such as being located near the main island of Okinawa~♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki srsthinking %}
That does make sense. In fact, a location being near to the mainland is a major factor in its development.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mizusaba %}
Mhm\~. You saw ruins everywhere, right\~? But it’s not like they always looked like that from the start\~.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora serious %}
So those ruins are relics of the time from when this island was prosperous?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mizusaba %}
Yep. They’re not historic ruins, but <em>abandoned</em> ruins.

Which means they’re buildings that began to break down after people stopped occupying them~. This island was once destroyed, and had deteriorated since then.

So your job is to bring back the radiance of such an unfortunate island~.

Nyahaha, this is a job that was meant for us locals, though\~. But since it’s such a complicated land, we need help from people outside the prefecture, too\~.

Especially Kanata-sama’s help. The people of this island are religious worshippers, so they likely won’t listen to anyone but Kanata-sama~.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata curious %}
w-what a heavy responsibility on me.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mizusaba %}
On the contrary, I think they’ll take everything Kanata-sama says seriously, like it’s said by an oracle from god—

So if you guide them efficiently, the islanders are bound to unite as one and do their best for you~.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata frownshake %}
it became an even heavier responsibility…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki grin2 %}
It’ll be alright, Kanata. We’ll all think about what to do together!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora fist %}
Ossu, *all for one!* That’s what Ryuseitai’s all about!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori sightired %}
Mm~… But I really do feel like restoring a whole island is way too massive of a job for us to handle…

I guess there’s nothing we can do about that, though, right… After all, Shinkai-senpai’s the commander this time, and this is the job he’s brought for us.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shinobu smilesoft %}
Mhm. Until this job is sorted out, the only thing we can do is devote our body and soul to our leader’s commands.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata smileconfident %}
y-yes. please and thank you. i will do my best as well, really.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mizusaba %}
Mhm, do your best\~. That’s why you should start by filling yourself up with a nice, tasty meal\~.

It’s as they say, you can’t fight on an empty stomach\~. Make sure to eat well and get enough nutrition, or you won’t be able to handle taking care of anyone\~♪
{% endbubble %}

<th>(I-I’m so nervous~!)</th>

<th>(Before deciding our next move, we thought it’d be best to first hear what this land — what the Hoshijima people — have in mind.)</th>

<th>(And I agree that that’s the right choice here; we <em>should</em> first confirm what the residents of this island wanna do.)</th>
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora frown %}
<th>(We could transform this place however we like without asking ‘em first, but… If the people living here won’t welcome it, then it’ll have been pointless.)</th>

<th>(It’s unreasonable to impose our own ideas on ‘em without a care for their perspective. Especially since we’re completely fed up with that sorta thing from the bottom of our hearts.)</th>
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora serious %}
<th>(I don’t think it’s right for us to do the same thing to ‘em that our agency did to us. It’s plain irritating when someone says, “I did it with the best intentions” without any regard for how you feel ‘bout it.)</th>[^23]

<th>(If possible, we wanna restore this land in the way the islanders want.)</th>

<th>(‘Cuz that’s how we also wanted to transform Ryuseitai, as best as possible.)</th>
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata norsmile %}
tetora.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora surprised0 %}
Hahyu—!? Wh-wh-what is it, Shinkai-senpai!? Is there an enemy invasion!?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata smilesoft %}
there are no [enemies] here~ you are too nervous.

it seems that i am [bad] at [explanations], so for [negotiations] with the other party, as well as [reporting] back the news to everyone—

i can only rely on tetora, as you are capable of [explaining] things properly.

so please stay [focused]. i am worried about you; you seem [distracted] somehow.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora awkward0 %}
O-Ossu! I’ll do my absolute best to meet your expectations, Senp— I mean, Taichou!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata northinking %}
but, why is it tetora?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora shocked %}
Huh!? A-Am I not good enough!?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata srsthinking %}
mm~… once it was decided we could meet with the [island’s higher-up], they told us only one person was permitted to [accompany] me.

because it would only stress them to have [so many strangers] barging in.

the people of this [island] have been confined in their village for a long time, so they appear to be relatively afraid of [others]… that cannot be [helped], though.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora frown %}
Ossu. If I were to put it in a negative light, it’s sorta exclusionary in a way.

It’s prolly like those closed-off villagers you often see in movies, who hate outsiders. So just in case, we can’t risk the unlikely scenario of ‘em attacking Shinkai-Taichou.

And ‘cuz I’m the most skilled in combat among the five of us, I’m accompanying Taichou as the bodyguard.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata norsmile %}
i do not think anything [violent] will happen, though… what i am [expecting] from tetora for this occasion is not [violence], but [the art] of [conversation].

after all, if they were to actually see us as [enemies], we would not be able to [get anywhere] with our job… so please behave in a [friendly manner].
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora frown %}
Uu~myu… It’s true that negotiation is the main goal here, yeah. In that case, Shinobu-kun should’ve joined you instead of me, honestly.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata smile %}
it will be alright. tetora can also do it as long as he tries. during the [commotion] we had a while back, you did your very best at that [crimson]-something, yes?

you managed it wonderfully, as the [executive staff] of the [evil organization].

that is not something that an [idiot] can do. only a [clever person] capable of [negotiations] would be able to accomplish that.

you are growing incredibly much more than [you] think, tetora.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora norsmile %}
…Ossu. Thank you, that’s very kind of you to say.

Yeah, true. I personally think back on that time like it’s my dark past, but… Through a change of positions, I managed to accomplish somethin’ I’d never been able to do before.

That experience’ll surely come in use too, right?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata smilesoft %}
yes. that is what i am [expecting].

…oh, i see the other party has [arrived].
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora glare %}
<th>(……! They’re making their appearance at last…! Uuu, I don’t feel mentally prepared for it at all, but—!)</th>

<th>(This isn’t a karate match — Reality never waits for you to prep yourself first!)</th>

<th>(Even in an unstable and shaky situation, I gotta do everythin’ in my power to stand my ground and do my best!)</th>
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora frustrated %}
<th>(The black flame is the mark of effort…!)</th>
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata smilesoft2 %}
<th>(fufu. tetora is always such a [hard worker]~ i truly do believe that part of you is [admirable].)</th>
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata frown %}
<th>(as for me, i am just [not there] at all~… i really am trying my best to do this [seriously], but i always end up being so floaty…)</th>
{% endbubble %}

{% img /img/es/eventstory/stellamaris/p1_9_2.jpg %}

{% bubble UnKonata %}
Please excuse me.

You suddenly called for me… But what on earth could this be for, Kanata-sama?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora shocked %}
<th>(…? Huh?)</th>

<th>(This kid…? This tiny li’l kid… is the higher-up who represents Hoshijima?)</th>

<th>(Wait— Doesn’t he kinda look like someone…?)</th>
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble UnKonata frown2 %}
As long as you do what you must, I don’t see a reason to report it to me.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata norsmile %}
we need you and your people’s [cooperation] so that we can achieve that goal. not only that — it is necessary that we learn about your [prospects].
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble UnKonata frown %}
Prospects? We simply want to continue living, even after God’s influence has vanished.

Any method will do. Survival takes precedence above all.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata yare %}
you are as [stiff] as ever~ i think you would be much [cuter] if you behaved more like a [child], you know?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata v2 %}
come on, kona-chan\~ smile, smile\~♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble UnKonata hmphright %}
Please do <em>not</em> call me “Kona-chan”.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata worried %}
uu~ but if i call you by your [real name], it will be easy to mix up with mine.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Konata frown %}
Hmph. I suppose it is true that the “Kona” in “Konata” and “Kana” sound similar to the ear.[^24]
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora curious %}
Konata…?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Konata %}
Yes…? Indeed, my name is Minase Konata, the lord of this island.[^25]
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora serious %}
Minase… Not “Shinkai”?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Konata curious %}
…? Whatever do you mean?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora awkward0 %}
Ah, well, you’re like the splitting image of Shinkai-Taichou, so I was wondering if you might be his sibling or relative.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata smile %}
yes, kona-chan is my adorable [little brother]~♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Konata glare %}
That isn’t true. You and I are complete strangers who have nothing to do with each other.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora curious %}
……?
{% endbubble %}

## Chapter 10

{% img /img/es/eventstory/stellamaris/p1_10.jpg %}

<div class="msr-narration">
    <p>That night, at the lodging accommodation for Ryuseitai…</p>
</div>

{% bubble Shinobu curious %}
Huh~… So the person that Mizusaba-san calls “Ani-sama” is the “Okinawa Oni” that I’ve heard about a few times?[^26]
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mizusaba %}
Yep\~. Well, “Oni” in Okinawa would be my grandpa, though\~. Apparently, it all originates from when he was a pirate who ran rampage across the island.

He barged into Okinawa seas with a gigantic ship he’d filched from some other country, and was super feared by everyone~. He’s just a withered up old man now, though.

Ani-sama is his successor\~, he’s called “The second generation of the Okinawa Oni”\~♪

He was truly respected\~. Actually, I’m the older one between us\~, but Ani-sama was like everyone’s big brother in a sense, so I call him “Ani-sama”\~.

I really respect him lots\~. He’s super strong\~, nobody can beat him in a fight\~. Where I lived, whenever someone had a problem, they’d talk to Ani-sama about it\~.

He’s gone to the US now, and nobody can reach him, so there’s not much anyone can do there.

But technically, if it were possible, we probably could have entrusted this job to Ani-sama instead of you guys~.

Ah, actually, though — This request involves religion, so maybe it wouldn’t have been a job for him? Huh, I wonder…?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki awkward %}
If I may interject — with the exception of Kanata, we aren’t experts in religion, either.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mizusaba %}
Ah— I’ve been meaning to mention this, but — you don’t have to talk so politely with me, y’know\~?[^27] It’s actually harder to understand you that way\~. Nobody uses polite language among my family, so\~♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori frown %}
Mm~… And likewise, we’re not really experts in rejuvenating land, either.

Shouldn’t something as large-scale as that be a job for <em>fine</em> instead of us, if we’re sticking to our agency…?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki smileexplain %}
Actually, it seems that they’re taking a move right now, too.

Sengoku mentioned Himemiya earlier, so I contacted Tenshouin — Apparently, <em>fine</em> is also working on something in Okinawa at the moment.

Tenshouin told me, “depending on the circumstances, we may be able to join forces with you, so feel free to rely on us if anything happens.”
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki awkward %}
It makes me happy to see his compassion for friendship, but… why is it that I get strangely anxious when he’s being kind…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shinobu northinking %}
Yes, since they apparently plan to build an ES branch of some sort in Okinawa. Tenshouin-dono and his unit members are likely working towards that.

Though, it’s more so a project to build an amusement park…[^28]

However, it seems that there is no land available in the mainland to build such a park, so they are instead aiming for Hoshijima.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki norsmile2 %}
Hm. If the amusement park and various establishments are arranged, its vicinity might actually develop tremendously, in a similar fashion to a certain dreamland.[^29]

While building the park, they may remove all the unusable ruins, too.

Although, that on its own is a pretty rare sight to see, and therefore perfectly suits being a tourist attraction.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori frown2 %}
It’s way too dangerous to be a tourist spot… We can still see them all the way from here, and the crumbling exterior is clearly peeling off just from the strong wind.

It’d be dangerous for anyone to get close… I think we’re better off having all of them demolished.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki serious %}
Mm. There are many plots of land across the world that are off-limits to the public for similar reasons.[^26]

If the buildings could only crumble, that’s still not too bad… But depending on the area, there could be landmines or unexploded bombs buried in the ground.[^30] It’s necessary to take these things into account.

Rather than to forcibly turn such a danger zone into a tourist attraction, it may be best to take the predictable path, and rebuild the area into an amusement park that can make an infinite amount of money.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori srsthinking %}
Those abandoned buildings don’t seem to be old enough to carry any cultural heritage either… It looks like any regular ghost town you’d find around the world.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki yare %}
Well, whatever we’ll do with those ruins depends on what sort of agreement Kanata and Nagumo reach with the islanders.

They may tell us not to tamper with those buildings in any way.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori frown %}
Oh yeah, I’m pretty curious what’s going on over there… I wonder if they’re doing okay… I hope they didn’t get dragged into some questionable ceremony by the religious people…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shinobu worried %}
That’s just prejudiced thinking, Midori-kun~ As mentioned before, they simply believe in a different religion — they are still human beings just like us.

I’m sure nothing inconceivable is happening to them at all!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata smileconfident %}
i am back~♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki %}
Oh, as soon as we mentioned them—

Welcome back, Kanata! Thanks for your hard work, and great job to Nagumo, too!

How was it? What did the islanders say?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata norsmile %}
yes, so. they were quite [unfriendly], but they [appeared] to be [accepting] of anything we plan to do~ or rather, they are indifferent either way.

that is how little they are willing to [cooperate] with us. it seems, though, that they will not [oppose] our decisions, either.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata yare %}
which is a good thing. it would have been a problem if they [forbade] all our choices after specifically [requesting] for our help.
{% endbubble %}

## Chapter 11

{% img /img/es/eventstory/stellamaris/p1_11.jpg %}

{% bubble Konata frown %}
While it is true that we have been confined for a long time, we don’t lack basic common sense.

I would appreciate it if you do not make light of us.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki shocked %}
……?

K-Kanata, who is this child…? Wait, don’t tell me—… Did you give birth to this kid!?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata yare %}
i cannot give birth, you know? i am a [guy]. i am not [saint mary]~?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki horrified %}
T-Then did you split apart and multiply in number!?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shinobu surprised0 %}
What!? This turn of events is a lot more inconceivable than I ever could’ve imagined…!?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata glare %}
i cannot multiply, either~? what do you think of me as?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Konata %}
Hello, everyone. It’s nice to meet you.

I’ve heard about all of you from Kanata-sama. You are Kanata-sama’s allies, who have come to aid us and our island — Known as Ryuseitai, correct?

As the lord of Hoshijima, I, Minase Konata, would like to express my deepest gratitude.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki curious %}
K-Konata? Is that his name because he’s a tiny Kanata?[^31]
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shinobu curious %}
Is it not simply <em>konata</em> for “here” and <em>kanata</em> for “there”…?[^32]
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki worried %}
Their names are really similar, though… Eh? Eh? Are they siblings?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora frown %}
I‘ve asked that question already.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori norsmile %}
Ah— Tetora-kun, welcome back to you, too~…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora serious %}
Ossu. Mm, so, this kid is apparently somethin’ like a relative to Shinkai-Taichou.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki srsthinking %}
What do you mean by “something like a relative”…?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora yare %}
Uu~myu… As always, everything Shinkai-Taichou says is too floaty to understand, and Konata-kun keeps denying any blood relations with him for some reason.

Honestly, I’ve still got no clue what sorta relationship this kid has with Shinkai-Taichou.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Konata frownshake %}
As I have stated already, we are complete strangers.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki frown %}
The resemblance is far too much for that to be possible… But alright, it seems like they have deep circumstances of their own, so I won’t ask for details.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Konata %}
I appreciate it. Erm, you’re the leader of Ryuseitai, correct?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki norsmile %}
No, Kanata’s the leader this time.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Konata curious %}
“This time”? I don’t quite understand, but am I correct to consider this person the leader then?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata niyaclosed %}
ehe\~ ehe\~♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Konata glare %}
What are you acting so proud for? I didn’t compliment you in any way.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata grin %}
onii-chan is so happy that he got to [introduce] his [close allies] to kona-chan~[^33] i was [forbidden] from doing so up until now.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Konata yare %}
That is because my existence was meant to be concealed. Nonetheless, since the main house of the religion had been abolished… It should be alright to show my appearance at the very least.

After all, our island must lift its isolation policy, and open itself up to the outside world moving forward.

I cannot be the only one who confines oneself far from the public’s eye.

Even if I were chosen simply due to blood relations, I am still the lord of this island in the end.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shinobu awkward %}
W-What a responsible kid… Incredible. I could <em>barely</em> speak this eloquently when I was around his age.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori serious %}
Erm… Konata-kun— Konata-chan…?[^34] How old are you?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Konata norsmile %}
I will become ten years old this year. My growth has been relatively slow for my age, as I had been living a poor lifestyle.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori curious %}
Ah, if that’s the case… I think there can be kids like this at that age? Probably?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora smileexplain %}
He may look like a preschooler… But he’s actually much more intelligent than he seems. He clearly understood our side of the story, and took our thoughts to heart.

Apparently, the islanders will abide by Konata-kun’s wishes, so as long as Konata-kun says it’s okay, then we’re all good to go.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki frown %}
That’s immensely helpful. Now we don’t have to worry about the possibility of the islanders strongly opposing us, leaving us unable to accomplish anything.

But still, this just leads us back to the matter of: What are we going to do next? How are we going to restore this island?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Konata %}
For that, we have something of our own in mind, as well.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora norsmile %}
That’d be great, then. I know we shouldn’t be saying this upfront, but we seriously haven’t thought up a single thing—
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shinobu awkward %}
Indeed. When we were practicing the “fish song”, we never even expected this to happen.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori yare %}
Seriously… It was just supposed to be a simple commercial filming…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Konata frown %}
I’m very sorry about that. Kanata-sama is always short on words.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata smilesoft %}
[talking] a lot is not very [god]-like, after all~♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Konata frown2 %}
You aren’t a god anymore, are you?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Konata %}
Regardless… It seems that the true governor of this land, the ZK Zaibatsu[^35], has also approved of developing the area. I am not aware what sort of magic trick was performed to accomplish this, but…

After such arrangements, it has been decided that a branch of the so-called “ES” will be built on this land.

When that happens, it inevitably means that this land will be dyed in the colors of idols.

However, we have not come in contact with idol culture for eons. It had been taboo to do so within this land.

Because of that, we don’t exactly know what an idol is.

That is why, I implore all of you — Please teach us what “idols” are.

[^2]: This is referring to <a href="/supervillain" target="_blank">Supervillain</a>, when Tetora was tasked to act as a spy in an agency that was also a criminal organization. The story happens in Okinawa.
[^3]: The word for “delicate” is <em>sensai</em>, and it can also mean “sensitive”. It was mentioned in Epilogue 1 of <a href="/submarine/epilogue/#Chapter-1" target="_blank">Submarine</a> (Translated as “sensitive” in that story).
[^4]: Referring to <a href="https://ensemble-stars.fandom.com/wiki/Supernova" target="_blank">Supernova</a>, a story that happens during their Yumenosaki days together.
[^5]: Referring to Ryuseitai and Akatsuki’s SS story, <a href="/submarine" target="_blank">Submarine</a>. Submarine covers various aspects mentioned in this story.
[^6]: Kanata says “let’s go” as you would in English, but written in hiragana in the text, as that’s how Kanata speaks.
[^7]: This is how Okinawans say “Welcome”.
[^8]: Chiaki has mentioned this before in <a href="/submarine/ruthless_battlefield/#Chapter-8" target="_blank">Submarine, Ruthless Battlefield 8</a>.

[^10]: Midori literally says “mascot character” in Japanese here. This is a different term from Midori’s favorite type of mascots, known as <em>yuruchara</em> (which are known to have odd but cute designs, unlike the typical mascot characters).
[^11]: Ani-sama, lit. “Elder brother” with “sama”, a polite honorific used for names.
[^12]: Mizusaba uses the 吾 (wa~) first-person pronoun to refer to himself. It’s a slightly old-fashioned, formal pronoun to refer to oneself.
[^13]: Mizusaba has no character model in the story. Since his name originates from a shark, I’ve decided to use a shark icon for the translation, so that he’s identifiable. The icon used is <a href="https://iconduck.com/icons/114306/sharktale" target="_blank">this</a>.
[^14]: The whale shark is extremely large, see <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whale_shark" target="_blank">here</a>.
[^15]: Mizusaba calling Kanata with “sama” indicates a deep respect for him. In addition, as general knowledge, the <em>sama</em> honorific is also used to refer to superior beings, like gods, deities, etc.
[^16]: The word for “monster” here is <em>kaibutsu</em> (怪物), usually referring to an ominous, strong-looking creature.
[^17]: In Japanese, Kanata says the words “main house, primary line, branch house, supporting line” all in hiragana, since Kanata always speaks in hiragana. However, this can be confusing to comprehend due to the lack of kanji to differentiate the words from each other. Shinobu then repeats the same 4 words, but in kanji this time. I decided to add an English equivalent to simulate a similar feeling the original line had. Thank you to my proofreader ryuseipuka for the localization!
[^18]: Originally, the wordplay is <em>basuke</em> (Basketball) with <em>risuke</em> (Reschedule). I tried to make an English equivalent of that.
[^19]: The cleansing ceremony was mentioned in the epilogues of <a href="https://ensemble-stars.fandom.com/wiki/Atlantis" target="_blank"><em>fine’s</em> Climax event</a>. Specifically, this sort of ceremony is to ask permission from the god of the land to do construction in the area, and praying everything goes well with the construction. Read more <a href="https://tinytotintokyo.com/jichinsai-%E5%9C%B0%E9%8E%AE%E7%A5%AD-a-shinto-ceremony-for-building-a-house-in-japan" target="_blank">here</a>.
[^20]: This expression was also mentioned in the chapter that Ryuseitai appeared <a href="/parallel_world" target="_blank">in Parallel World</a> (Ra\*bits’ Climax event).
[^21]: This scene was slightly adjusted. The main translation follows the story as it currently is in-game, but if you’d like to see the version before it was adjusted, please <a href="/stella_maris/hidden_island_v2#Disclaimer" target="_blank">go here</a>.
[^22]: Closed circle of suspects is a common genre of detective novels, where there are only a set number of suspects possible for a murder. See more <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Closed_circle_of_suspects" target="_blank">here</a>.
[^23]: This is referring to the events that happened to Ryuseitai throughout the previous year. For more information, please read the !! Era stories that precede this story, such as <a href="/comet_show" target="_blank">Comet Show</a>, <a href="/submarine" target="_blank">Submarine</a>, <a href="/supervillain" target="_blank">Supervillain</a>, etc…
[^24]: Unlike young Kanata in <a href="/abyss" target="_blank">ABYSS</a>, Konata speaks in polite language, as well as using kanji in his speech. His first-person pronoun is <em>watashi</em>, a neutral pronoun (and the standard first-person pronoun in Japanese). Also, while he does share the same 2D model as young Kanata, he has no voice clips when speaking.
[^25]: “Konata” is only in hiragana. As for <em>minase</em>, the kanji is 水無瀬 (water, inexistent/none, shallows/current). Minase originally referred to a stream of water flowing underground, but the surface appears to be dried up. Read more <a href="https://saigyo.sakura.ne.jp/minase.html" target="_blank">here</a> (Japanese source). There is also a Shinto shrine in Osaka called Minase Jingu Shrine, said to have one of Japan’s best 100 natural water sources. Read more <a href="https://osaka-info.jp/en/spot/minasejingu/" target="_blank">here</a> (English source).
[^26]: “Oni” means demon or ogre. Oni was first mentioned in <a href="/supervillain" target="_blank">Supervillain</a>.
[^27]: Chiaki was speaking in polite Japanese speech (keigo) when with Mizusaba.
[^28]: This is referring to <a href="https://ensemble-stars.fandom.com/wiki/Atlantis" target="_blank">Atlantis</a>, <em>fine’s</em> Climax event.
[^29]: This is possibly referring to Nara Dreamland and Yokohama Dreamland, but unfortunately I’m not sure of its history. You can read more here: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nara_Dreamland" target="_blank">Nara Dreamland</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yokohama_Dreamland" target="_blank">Yokohama Dreamland</a>.
[^30]: Also known as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unexploded_ordnance" target="_blank">unexploded ordnance</a>.
[^31]: This is a wordplay in Japanese. Chiaki asks if his name is <em>konata</em>, as in <em>ko</em> 小 (small) + <em>nata</em>, because he’s a “tiny” Kanata.
[^32]: The kanji 此方 (<em>konata</em>) means “here, this way/direction”, whereas the kanji 彼方 (<em>kanata</em>) means “over that way, (beyond) the distance, far away”. Konata’s first name is in full hiragana (no kanji), whereas the kanji in Kanata’s name (奏汰) is homophonous with 彼方 (far away).
[^33]: Onii-chan, as in “big brother”.
[^34]: For young children, “-kun” is usually used for boys, and “-chan” for girls.
[^35]: This is referring to the ZK Zaibatsu that was mentioned in <a href="https://ensemble-stars.fandom.com/wiki/Atlantis" target="_blank">Atlantis</a>, <em>fine’s</em> Climax event. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zaibatsu" target="_blank">Zaibatsu</a> is business conglomerates in Japan.
