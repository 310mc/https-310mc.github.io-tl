{% bubble Chiaki grin2 %}
Alright! Time-out strategy!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata smileconfident %}
okay, i will allow a [time-out].
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki norsmile2 %}
Sengoku, Takamine, Nagumo, come with me. Let’s discuss what we’ll be doing together from here on.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora norsmile %}
Ossu. We need to talk this over ASAP.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata curious %}
oh\~? am i the only one being [left out]\~?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki %}
Sorry. We’ll be done shortly, so please bear with it for now.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shinobu worried %}
Morisawa-dono…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki smilesoft %}
Don’t make that face, Sengoku. It’ll be alright. We can’t be the ones in the wrong here.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora awkward0 %}
It sounds like you’re tellin’ that to yourself more than anyone else…?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori sad2 %}
This is starting to make me think that the concept of changing leaders for every job really <em>is</em> impractical—… It was a tough time when it was my turn, too…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora nod %}
But your turn was a huge success, wasn’t it, Midori-kun?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori frownshake %}
Only in terms of the outcome… I honestly don’t ever wanna do it again…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shinobu v2 %}
However, I feel as though we’ve managed to have excellent success thus far. Although, the agency has remained silent the whole time, which is a little scary—
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora serious %}
That’s ‘cuz we’ve been regularly producing results. The agency can’t make complaints over somethin’ like that, right?

And so far, it seems that our fans are accepting how we are right now.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki awkward %}
They do seem a little bewildered, though, since we changed courses so suddenly before providing them with a proper explanation.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora smileconfident %}
But even then, as we continue to approach things in a new way, I feel like they’re gradually coming to understand how we operate.

I can sense an increase in the amount of fans gladly looking forward to seeing who’ll be leader next.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki norsmile %}
Yeah. I’d like to ride that pleasant wave if possible, and correct our trajectory after having fallen down rock bottom for a period of time.

No, in fact— I want to make a huge comeback here from the brink of death.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora smilesoft %}
Ossu. I split from Ryuseitai for a while, even if it was only for an infiltration mission[^1], so — I know this’ll sound weird comin’ from me, but… We all feel the exact same way.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki norsmile2 %}
We should avoid rushing at all costs, though. Let’s regain our radiance, slowly but surely.

We aren’t in a tokusatsu show with a running time of thirty minutes per episode only.

It’s impossible to solve every little thing and reach a happy ending in one single shot, like turning the tables with a new form change or secret weapon.

We have no choice but to chip away at our problem in this reality, steadily and carefully.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki serious %}
It’s through this recent policy to steadily work hard together, that Kanata was tasked with the commander role this time, but—

What do you guys think about it, frankly?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shinobu sightired %}
I think it’s pretty freaking bad.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori worried0 %}
Ah— Shinobu-kun, you thought so, too? I felt the same way, but I just couldn’t get myself to say anything about it when Shinkai-senpai looked <em>so</em> happy…!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki grin2 %}
There’s no need to hold back just because we’re your seniors, y’know? Healthy relationships can only be formed when we can point out each other’s shortcomings without hesitation!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora yare %}
Aight, then I’d like to mention this upfront: Morisawa-senpai, you stink, so please try not to get near me.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki surprised0 %}
That’s so mean!? Eh? Eh!? Takamine keeps criticizing me for stinking of sweat, so I’ve been really careful, though…!?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora frown %}
It’s the amount of deodorant you use — it’s <em>way</em> too much. Everythin’ is so extreme and excessive with you.

Deodorants are supposed to suppress the smell of sweat, not to numb other people’s senses, ‘kay?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki frownshake %}
M-Mm! I’ll make sure that I use the right amount!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shinobu grin %}
Fufu. Morisawa-dono, you worry about what others say about you… You are surprisingly delicate, aren’t you?[^2]
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki frustrated %}
I really am! I’m a delicate guy, like a fruit that rots from wherever it’s touched!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori serious %}
……Morisawa Durian Chiaki.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki shocked %}
Don’t call me by the name of a stinky fruit in a whisper! That’s bullying! There’s bullying taking place in Ryuseitai…!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori serious %}
Durians are also delicious fruits, though… They’re the king of fruits…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki smile %}
Oh! So what you were trying to say is that I may have my weak points, but I have my strong points too, Takamine! You sure are bad at compliments!
{% endbubble %}

## Chapter 2

{% bubble Chiaki frown %}
Let’s return to the topic at hand. I only first became aware of it through this job, but — Kanata is extremely bad at leading people from a higher position.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shinobu northinking %}
I believe Shinkai-dono was the president of the Marine Life Club when he was in Yumenosaki, though—
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki serious %}
Do you recall any proper achievements the Marine Life Club accomplished as a club?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shinobu awkward %}
Now that you mention it, I could never understand what on earth they were doing there… Perhaps that isn’t something to be said by someone from the Ninja Association, though.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki frown2 %}
Exactly, that’s the problem: We can barely understand what on earth he’s doing.

Everything Kanata says is so vague, that we can’t at all tell what he actually wants to do.

The only reason we came to know that our job is for a commercial filming is thanks to Sengoku, who ran all over the place and surveyed everyone for information.

Kanata, on the other hand, told us nothing past, “it is a fish job!”.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora frown %}
It feels like he’s expecting us to use our comprehension skills to understand each and every instruction, too… I definitely remember a time in Yumenosaki when Shinkai-senpai guided us as a coach, though…[^3]
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki frown %}
Back then, I was the one who set up the fundamentals. Kanata simply just had to compare that with your performances and fill in the lacking areas.

In other words, he excels as an assistant, but the very moment Kanata is the corepoint, it’s impossible to understand what’s going on.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki sighdrop %}
…What are we to do?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora yare %}
Well, I mean… We’ve got no choice but to handle it somehow. It’s pretty nerve-wracking not knowing where we’re headed, though.

After all, we follow the fundamental concept of the reborn Ryuseitai, and that is: The member who takes up the commander role will be in charge of everything, and the rest of the members will follow his command.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki frownshake %}
Mm… It’s worrisome, but we can’t go back on our word now. We’ve only just decided to work abiding by this direction.

It also isn’t cool to retract one’s statement right after saying something so brave.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki serious %}
Plus, our job this time is small-scaled; it’s only a single commercial filming. Of course, that doesn’t in <em>any</em> way mean we should cut corners, but—

In the worst case that we cause an accident and make mistakes, we should be able to minimize damages.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki norsmile2 %}
And it’s by repeating such mistakes, using them as fuel to learn and grow, that even Kanata will one day become a splendid comma—
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata smilesoft %}
okaay, [time-out] is over~♪

unfortunately, it is [time] for us to stop here, so come on everyone, let us [depart]!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki curious %}
D-Depart? What are you talking about?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata norsmile %}
huh? did i not [explain] this to all of you?

the [commercial filming] is located in [okinawa].
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki surprised %}
*Okinawa!?* We did go to Okinawa for the SS qualifying round last year, but—[^4]
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata nod %}
yes. it is due to the [relationships] i made during that time that i was able to receive this [job].
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki worried %}
Wouldn’t it have been nice to tell us something as important as that much earlier? Don’t you know we have our own planning and mental preparation to do beforehand!?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora awkward0 %}
Uumyu, we’re going to Okinawa…? It was fine during the SS qualifying round and all, but it’s tricky for me to show my face now, when I’ve had connections to Crimson Production before.[^5]
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki fist %}
You have to think in the opposite direction, Nagumo! Consider it a chance to sort out all the things you left undone back then!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora norsmile %}
Ossu. I’m clumsy like Morisawa-senpai, so I’ve got a lotta things I inadvertently left unsettled. I gotta make sure to pay off my debts.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata v2 %}
then it is time to [depart]\~! let’s go\~♪[^6]
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori worried0 %}
Shinkai-senpai’s strangely in high spirits… You let us have so many opportunities up until now, but if you’re acting this way, does it mean you actually wanted to be the leader deep down, after all…?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata grin %}
ah, no~ i do not really [like] to be high and mighty like a [king] or [god].

but this time around, there is something i am [looking forward] to.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori v3 %}
………?

## Translation Notes

[^1]: Referring to <a href="/supervillain" target="_blank">Supervillain</a>, when Tetora was tasked to be a spy in a criminal organization.
[^2]: The word for “delicate” is <em>sensai</em>, the same word Midori refers to Tetora, Chiaki, and himself in Epilogue 1 of <a href="/submarine" target="_blank">Submarine</a> (Translated as “sensitive” in that story).
[^3]: Referring to <a href="https://ensemble-stars.fandom.com/wiki/Supernova" target="_blank">Supernova</a>.
[^4]: Referring to Ryuseitai and Akatsuki's SS story, <a href="/submarine" target="_blank">Submarine</a>.
[^5]: This is also referring to <a href="/supervillain" target="_blank">Supervillain</a>, the agency that Tetora was a spy in for a while.
[^6]: Kanata says “let's go” as you would in English, though it was written in hiragana in the text, implying it's said how you would in Japanese.
