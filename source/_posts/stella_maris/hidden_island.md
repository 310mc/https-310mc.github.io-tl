{% bubble Chiaki grin2 %}
Alright! Time-out strategy!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata smileconfident %}
okay, i will allow a [time-out].
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki norsmile2 %}
Sengoku, Takamine, Nagumo, come with me. Let’s discuss what we’ll be doing together from here on.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora norsmile %}
Ossu. We need to talk this over ASAP.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata curious %}
oh\~? am i the only one being [left out]\~?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki %}
Sorry. We’ll be done shortly, so please bear with it for now.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shinobu worried %}
Morisawa-dono…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki smilesoft %}
Don’t make that face, Sengoku. It’ll be alright. We can’t be the ones in the wrong here.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora awkward0 %}
It sounds like you’re tellin’ that to yourself more than anyone else…?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori sad2 %}
This is starting to make me think that the concept of changing leaders for every job really <em>is</em> impractical—… It was a tough time when it was my turn, too…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora nod %}
But your turn was a huge success, wasn’t it, Midori-kun?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori frownshake %}
Only in terms of the outcome… I honestly don’t ever wanna do it again…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shinobu v2 %}
However, I feel as though we’ve managed to have excellent success thus far. Although, the agency has remained silent the whole time, which is a little scary—
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora serious %}
That’s ‘cuz we’ve been regularly producing results. The agency can’t make complaints over somethin’ like that, right?

And so far, it seems that our fans are accepting how we are right now.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki awkward %}
They do seem a little bewildered, though, since we changed courses so suddenly before providing them with a proper explanation.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora smileconfident %}
But even then, as we continue to approach things in a new way, I feel like they’re gradually coming to understand how we operate.

I can sense an increase in the amount of fans gladly looking forward to seeing who’ll be leader next.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki norsmile %}
Yeah. I’d like to ride that pleasant wave if possible, and correct our trajectory after having fallen down rock bottom for a period of time.

No, in fact— I want to make a huge comeback here from the brink of death.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora smilesoft %}
Ossu. I split from Ryuseitai for a while, even if it was only for an infiltration mission[^1], so — I know this’ll sound weird comin’ from me, but… We all feel the exact same way.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki norsmile2 %}
We should avoid rushing at all costs, though. Let’s regain our radiance, slowly but surely.

We aren’t in a tokusatsu show with a running time of thirty minutes per episode only.

It’s impossible to solve every little thing and reach a happy ending in one single shot, like turning the tables with a new form change or secret weapon.

We have no choice but to chip away at our problem in this reality, steadily and carefully.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki serious %}
It’s through this recent policy to steadily work hard together, that Kanata was tasked with the commander role this time, but—

What do you guys think about it, frankly?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shinobu sightired %}
I think it’s pretty freaking bad.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori worried0 %}
Ah— Shinobu-kun, you thought so, too? I felt the same way, but I just couldn’t get myself to say anything about it when Shinkai-senpai looked <em>so</em> happy…!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki grin2 %}
There’s no need to hold back just because we’re your seniors, y’know? Healthy relationships can only be formed when we can point out each other’s shortcomings without hesitation!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora yare %}
Aight, then I’d like to mention this upfront: Morisawa-senpai, you stink, so please try not to get near me.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki surprised0 %}
That’s so mean!? Eh? Eh!? Takamine keeps criticizing me for stinking of sweat, so I’ve been really careful, though…!?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora frown %}
It’s the amount of deodorant you use — it’s <em>way</em> too much. Everythin’ is so extreme and excessive with you.

Deodorants are supposed to suppress the smell of sweat, not to numb other people’s senses, ‘kay?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki frownshake %}
M-Mm! I’ll make sure that I use the right amount!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shinobu grin %}
Fufu. Morisawa-dono, you worry about what others say about you… You are surprisingly delicate, aren’t you?[^2]
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki frustrated %}
I really am! I’m a delicate guy, like a fruit that rots from wherever it’s touched!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori serious %}
……Morisawa Durian Chiaki.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki shocked %}
Don’t call me by the name of a stinky fruit in a whisper! That’s bullying! There’s bullying taking place in Ryuseitai…!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori serious %}
Durians are also delicious fruits, though… They’re the king of fruits…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki smile %}
Oh! So what you were trying to say is that I may have my weak points, but I have my strong points too, Takamine! You sure are bad at compliments!
{% endbubble %}

## Chapter 2

{% bubble Chiaki frown %}
Let’s return to the topic at hand. I only first became aware of it through this job, but — Kanata is extremely bad at leading people from a higher position.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shinobu northinking %}
I believe Shinkai-dono was the president of the Marine Life Club when he was in Yumenosaki, though—
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki serious %}
Do you recall any proper achievements the Marine Life Club accomplished as a club?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shinobu awkward %}
Now that you mention it, I could never understand what on earth they were doing there… Perhaps that isn’t something to be said by someone from the Ninja Association, though.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki frown2 %}
Exactly, that’s the problem: We can barely understand what on earth he’s doing.

Everything Kanata says is so vague and floaty, that we can’t at all tell what he actually wants to do.

The only reason we came to know that our job is for a commercial filming is thanks to Sengoku, who ran all over the place and surveyed everyone for information.

Kanata, on the other hand, told us nothing past, “it is a fish job!”.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora frown %}
It feels like he’s expecting us to use our comprehension skills to understand each and every instruction, too… I definitely remember a time in Yumenosaki when Shinkai-senpai guided us as a coach, though…[^3]
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki frown %}
Back then, I was the one who set up the fundamentals. Kanata simply just had to compare that with your performances and fill in the lacking areas.

In other words, he excels as an assistant, but the very moment Kanata is the corepoint, it’s impossible to understand what’s going on.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki sighdrop %}
…What are we to do?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora yare %}
Well, I mean… We’ve got no choice but to handle it somehow. It’s pretty nerve-wracking not knowing where we’re headed, though.

After all, we follow the fundamental concept of the reborn Ryuseitai, and that is: The member who takes up the commander role will be in charge of everything, and the rest of the members will follow his command.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki frownshake %}
Mm… It’s worrisome, but we can’t go back on our word now. We’ve only just decided to work abiding by this direction.

It also isn’t cool to retract one’s statement right after saying something so brave.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki serious %}
Plus, our job this time is small-scaled; it’s only a single commercial filming. Of course, that doesn’t in <em>any</em> way mean we should cut corners, but—

In the worst case that we cause an accident and make mistakes, we should be able to minimize damages.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki norsmile2 %}
And it’s by repeating such mistakes, using them as fuel to learn and grow, that even Kanata will one day become a splendid comma—
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata smilesoft %}
okaay, [time-out] is over~♪

unfortunately, it is [time] for us to stop here, so come on everyone, let us [depart]!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki curious %}
D-Depart? What are you talking about?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata norsmile %}
huh? did i not [explain] this to all of you?

the [commercial filming] is located in [okinawa].
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki surprised %}
*Okinawa!?* We did go to Okinawa for the SS qualifying round last year, but—[^4]
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata nod %}
yes. it is due to the [relationships] i made during that time that i was able to receive this [job].
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki worried %}
Wouldn’t it have been nice to tell us something as important as that much earlier? Don’t you know we have our own planning and mental preparation to do beforehand!?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora awkward0 %}
Uumyu, we’re going to Okinawa…? It was fine during the SS qualifying round and all, but it’s tricky for me to show my face now, when I’ve had connections to Crimson Production before.[^5]
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki fist %}
You have to think in the opposite direction, Nagumo! Consider it a chance to sort out all the things you left undone back then!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora norsmile %}
Ossu. I’m clumsy like Morisawa-senpai, so I’ve got a lotta things I inadvertently left unsettled. I gotta make sure to pay off my debts.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata v2 %}
then it is time to [depart]\~! let’s go\~♪[^6]
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori worried0 %}
Shinkai-senpai’s strangely in high spirits… You let us have so many opportunities up until now, but if you’re acting this way, does it mean you actually wanted to be the leader deep down, after all…?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata grin %}
ah, no~ i do not really [like] to be high and mighty like a [king] or [god].

but this time around, there is something i am [looking forward] to.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori v3 %}
………?
{% endbubble %}

## Chapter 3

{% img /img/es/eventstory/stellamaris/p1_3.jpg %}

<div class="msr-narration">
    <p>The next morning. In Okinawa…</p>
</div>

{% bubble Kanata v2 %}
we have arrived~♪

everyone, mensooore\~♪[^7] welcome to [okinawa]\~!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki awkward %}
Are you a local now?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora smilesoft %}
Ahaha. To be fair, all of us have a pretty deep connection to this place at this point.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori sighdrop %}
Uu~ I know Okinawa’s just got that kinda climate, but… it feels like the hottest days of summer here even though it’s still spring… My body’s starting to act up a little…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shinobu sightired %}
I know what you mean~… I also tend to feel unwell by the slightest change in environment, so I have to be careful.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori sighfrown %}
Yeah… I brought over-the-counter medicine with me, so let me know if you’re low on anything… Then again, it’s probably not a good idea to share medicine much…

I don’t even think the other three can be thoughtful about this sort of thing, since I bet they can live in any environment just fine, so…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shinobu norsmile %}
Ah, to one’s surprise, Morisawa-dono is quite sensitive to changes in environment as well, as he was once a sickly child.[^8]

In fact, he has always provided me support every time I was on the verge of falling ill.

But I appreciate the thought, Midori-kun. It really makes me happy.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shinobu awkward %}
You see, I was continuously participating in a harsh show called “2x2” up until recently[^9]… And my troublesome friend made me go through with his whims the whole time.

So a friend simply showing concern for me is enough to move my heart.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori sighfrown %}
Wasn’t that a 2wink program or something… Making our Shinobu-kun miserable is unforgivable…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shinobu sigh %}
Ah, no, the show itself was quite fun and fulfilling until the very end.

But as one would expect, it was pretty tough to constantly be invited as a semi-regular participant in a show I hadn’t planned to be in so often…

So it was a little out of my capacity… My stamina has completely dried up thanks to that, and I feel somewhat exhausted.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori worried %}
If you feel worn out, how about Tetora-kun and I take turns carrying you…?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shinobu worried %}
No, no! I’m not a baby, you know~?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora curious %}
Heeey\~! What’re you two talkin’ about together\~?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora serious %}
We gotta hurry a li’l. It seems like this isn’t our final destination, and we’ll have to get on a ship to make it there—

But if we’re late to board it, we’ll have to wait a whole day for another one to hitch a ride.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori frownshake %}
What… Where the heck are we going…?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shinobu serious %}
Is it a remote island that rarely has visitors?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora awkward0 %}
Uu~myu… As usual, everything Shinkai-senpai says is too vague and floaty to really know what it is.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shinobu srsthinking %}
That is one of Shinkai-dono’s charms… However, I think about this a lot, but is he truly alright carrying out his daily life activities like this…?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora norsmile %}
We’ll just have to make sure we support him then — as much as he has for us, at the very least. Ossu.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori serious %}
Yeah… Shinkai-senpai is our mascot character[^10]… We need to protect him at all costs.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata norsmile %}
…? what is wrong, everyone? are you tired from the [long trip] after all~?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki fist %}
You guys are so half-hearted despite your young age! C’mon now, you’ve got this! Muster all your energy from the depths of your stomach…!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora frown %}
I think ‘bout this a lot too, but — Our seniors are <em>way</em> too energetic.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shinobu awkward %}
Ahaha. The fact that there was a time when even our over-energetic seniors lost their energy truly shows how abnormal the situation was for Ryuseitai.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shinobu smile %}
But right now, their energy is starting to return, at least. The goofy atmosphere that Ryuseitai had in the past, too.

Just that alone makes me happy. We should be content with that, I’m sure.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata curious %}
mm\~…? mm\~…?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki curious %}
…? What have you been looking around for, Kanata? Did you drop something? Would you like to look for it together?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata serious %}
no, erm. we are supposed to have someone [pick us up] from here—

he will lead us to the [place] by [boat]… but i do not [see him] anywhere, even though we are supposed to have met him [by now].
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shinobu northinking %}
Mm~ I did hear something about Okinawans having a different sense of time from us, as they live in a paradise-like environment.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora serious %}
Apparently, it’s like that in other countries, too. If anything, it’s only Japanese people who’re way too punctual when it comes to time.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori norsmile %}
Heheh. In that case, with how floaty Shinkai-senpai is about everything, he might actually be the universal standard.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki surprised0 %}
Mm—? Y-You guys…!?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shinobu surprised %}
Hweh? What’s the matter all of a sudden, Morisawa-dono?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki worried %}
B-B-Behind you! There’s someone standing right behind you guys!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shinobu curious %}
Eh…?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata v2 %}
ahh, hello~♪

ah, no— how do people [greet] each other in [okinawa] again…? Ermm, haitai~?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mizusaba unknown %}
Haitai~…♪

But no worries, there’s no need to speak in Okinawan dialect with me~. We also like to use the mainland’s language thanks to our westernized “Ani-sama’s”[^11] influence.

In fact, kids might not even understand you if you talk in Okinawan dialect~…♪
{% endbubble %}

{% img /img/es/eventstory/stellamaris/tetoraorigcg.jpg %}

{% bubble Tetora surprised0 %}
……!

<th>(Huh!? Wh-What’s with this person…? From how the two’re talking, I think he’s the person Shinkai-senpai was looking for, but—)</th>

<th>(He’s *huge!* Midori-kun’s pretty tall already, yet he’s *two heads* taller than him!? It’s like the perspective’s gone wonky all’a sudden!)</th>

<th>(A-A giant…? Is he seriously human like us?)</th>
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mizusaba unknown %}
Oh wow? Some of you seem scared…?

Sorry\~. I’m not scary, really\~. I won’t eat you up\~…♪[^12]
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata norsmile %}
yes, this is the person who will [guide] us to our job’s [location] — ermm, what was your [name] again?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mizusaba %}
Friends and family call me “Mizusaba”\~.[^13] I’m pretty huge, after all\~. Fufufu\~♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori curious %}
Mizusaba…?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata smilesoft %}
it refers to the [whale sharkie]~ [okinawans] call it that.[^14]
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori norsmile %}
That’s Shinkai-senpai for you; he knows so much about fish.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mizusaba %}
Mhm. Kanata-sama[^15] is what you’d call an erudite\~. We all respect him\~.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori curious %}
Kanata-“sama”…?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mizusaba %}
Ah, wait— We don’t have the time to chat right now… The ship is ready, so let’s hurry to the harbor and hop on board~.

We can talk all we like once we’re settled~…♪
{% endbubble %}

## Chapter 4

{% img /img/es/eventstory/stellamaris/p1_4.jpg %}

<div class="msr-narration">
    <p>Nearly an hour later. Onboard the ship to the location…</p>
</div>

{% bubble Tetora srsthinking %}
Hm, hm.

So to summarize — “Mizusaba”-san is a worshipper of Shinkai-senpai’s uh, religion…? The same one he mentioned before, right?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mizusaba %}
Ah\~ I’m not, actually\~? We’re pretty influential in Okinawa’s main island, so we act as mediators — the bridge between the local worshippers and Kanata-sama\~…♪

The worshippers don’t get involved with other people much, after all\~. Without a point of contact, the conversation won’t get anywhere\~, such a bother, right\~…♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora curious %}
<th>(Mm~… “Mizusaba”-san may look intimidating, but he’s actually a pretty calm, kind person, huh?)</th>

<th>(But he’s just so huge that my instincts acted up as soon as he was in close range.)</th>
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora smile %}
<th>(Heheh. I kinda recall feeling somethin’ similar with Shinkai-senpai when I first talked to him. He’s pretty big, and his voice has a peculiar frequency when he speaks, so I didn’t think he was a human being like me.)</th>

<th>(He seemed more like a strange, mysterious monster at first.)</th>[^16]

<th>(That just sounds funny to me now, though — ‘Cuz Shinkai-senpai is actually harmless. I’d actually say he’s even kinder than ordinary people.)</th>
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki northinking %}
Hm. Speaking of which, Kanata made contact with those worshippers during the SS qualifying round, didn’t he?[^17]
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata smilesoft %}
yes. if we are to consider my household as the [client] fish, like a [giant moray eel], then the [okinawans] would be the [cleaner fish], like a [bluestreak cleaner wrasse].
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shinobu serious %}
Main house, primary line. Branch house, supporting line.[^18]
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki awkward %}
Thank you for the translation.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki srsthinking %}
If I’m not mistaken, the worshippers that split into their own branch a long time ago advanced a religion of their own in Okinawa, right?

But even then, those from the supporting line consider Kanata as their God as well, so—
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata norsmile %}
yes. though i am no longer a [god], of course.

but even so, there is no way i can abandon [those] who adore and worship me as [one]—

so after the qualifying round was over, i have been staying in [contact] with those [worshippers] every now and then.

after all, i had [promised] them that i would [help] them if they are ever in trouble.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki norsmile %}
During the qualifying round, the reason we managed to achieve victory in the ruthless battlefield here in Okinawa was also thanks to the cooperation and support of the locals.[^19]

We ought to repay that favor, at the very least.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora yare %}
Ossu. Though, thanks to that, I ended up getting dispatched as a spy after they concluded Ryuseitai likely has a lotta influence ‘round Okinawa.[^20]
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki smilesoft %}
That’s because it’s impossible for everything to have a 100% positive influence.

There’s no such thing as the 100% perfect right answer. What’s important is looking at the outcome of your choice, then making full use of the positive effects that it brought, while recovering from the negative effects as fast as possible.

That’s why it’s always important to change strategies when necessary, and be flexible with your approaches.

Those are the fundamentals of basketball.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori curious %}
You were talking about basketball?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shinobu nod %}
He’s talking about “overhaul” through “basketball”.[^21]
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki grin2 %}
That was a good one! Sengoku, you win one million zabuton cushions!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shinobu awkward %}
If you were to stack <em>that</em> many cushions on top of each other, it would exceed the Earth’s atmosphere.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki grin2 %}
And that’s how we’ll become stars! Fuhahahaha…!! ☆
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata serious %}
ermm, may i get back on [topic]?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori sightired %}
Please, by all means. There’ll be no end in sight if an idiot’s nonsense is encouraged.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata smileconfident %}
fufufu\~ i like this sort of thing too, though\~♪

but yes, so. since SS, i have been occasionally performing some [activities] with the [okinawan] people.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shinobu smilesoft %}
I heard the gist of that before.

I’ve basically been managing everyone’s schedule in Ryuseitai, as nobody tries to do it themselves, so that is how I know.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki grin2 %}
Mhm! Letting Sengoku take care of everything will guarantee us no problems!

I would rather you don’t rely on me so much for that~… I’m quite feeble, so it may eventually crush me.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shinobu srsthinking %}
In any case, after having performed various activities, Shinkai-dono has gained a reputation within Okinawa.

Perhaps this is not the best expression, but it seems like at this point, he is almost treated as a God here.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki frown %}
<em>That</em> again…? I thought you stopped behaving as if you’re a God?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata nod2 %}
ahh, well~ it is a force of [habit], you see~
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki awkward %}
Force of *habit…*?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki serious %}
Well, either way, I’m starting to see the picture.

That’s why Kanata once again got a request from the Okinawan people— or rather, from the worshippers who believe in him, right?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori yare %}
They’re using him for their own convenience, aren’t they… I think it’s fine to refuse to do anything you don’t wanna do, y’know?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata smile %}
oh, no, no~ it is not like i do not want to [do] it~?

it makes me very [happy] to be [useful] to others.

it is possible that my [senses] are [different] from all of yours, but…

the [worshippers] also simply believe in an [uncommon religion], that is all.

they do not cause any [harm], nor do they bear any [sins].
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki norsmile %}
Of course. Hate the sin, not the sinner. If they aren’t doing any harm, then they’re also citizens with human rights, who deserve to be protected.

In fact, I hope that our— or rather, *Kanata’s* activities, can clear off the prejudices and misunderstandings those kinds of people face, even if only a little.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata norsmile %}
yes. [mikejima] might have a different [opinion] here, but… i have [high hopes] for something like that.

## Translation Notes

[^1]: Referring to <a href="/supervillain" target="_blank">Supervillain</a>, when Tetora was tasked to be a spy in a criminal organization.
[^2]: The word for “delicate” is <em>sensai</em>, the same word Midori refers to Tetora, Chiaki, and himself in Epilogue 1 of <a href="/submarine" target="_blank">Submarine</a> (Translated as “sensitive” in that story).
[^3]: Referring to <a href="https://ensemble-stars.fandom.com/wiki/Supernova" target="_blank">Supernova</a>.
[^4]: Referring to Ryuseitai and Akatsuki's SS story, <a href="/submarine" target="_blank">Submarine</a>.
[^5]: This is also referring to <a href="/supervillain" target="_blank">Supervillain</a>, the agency that Tetora was a spy in for a while.
[^6]: Kanata says “let's go” as you would in English, though it was written in hiragana in the text, implying it's said how you would in Japanese.
[^7]: This is how Okinawans say “Welcome”.
[^8]: Chiaki has mentioned this before in <a href="/submarine/ruthless_battlefield/#Chapter-8" target="_blank">Submarine, in Ruthless Battlefield 9</a>.
[^9]: Referring to 2wink's Climax Event, <a href="https://twilightmalachite.tumblr.com/2x2" target="_blank">2x2</a>.
[^10]: Midori literally says “mascot character” in Japanese here. This is a different term from Midori's favorite type of mascots, known as <em>yuruchara</em> (which are known to have odd but cute designs, unlike the typical mascot characters).
[^11]: Ani-sama, lit. “Elder brother” with “sama”, a polite honorific used for names.
[^12]: Mizusaba uses the 吾 (wa~) first-person pronoun to refer to himself. It's a formal pronoun to refer to oneself.
[^13]: Mizusaba has no character model in the story. Since his name originates from a shark, I've decided to use a shark icon for the translation for a prettier visual. The icon used is <a href="https://iconduck.com/icons/114306/sharktale" target="_blank">this</a>.
[^14]: The whale shark is extremely large, see <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whale_shark" target="_blank">here</a>.
[^15]: Mizusaba calling Kanata with “sama” implies a deep respect for him. In addition, as general knowledge, the <em>sama</em> honorific is also used to refer to superior beings, like gods, deities, etc.
[^16]: The word for “monster” here is <em>kaibutsu</em> (怪物), usually referring to an ominous, strong-looking creature.
[^17]: Referring to Ryuseitai and Akatsuki's SS story, <a href="/submarine" target="_blank">Submarine, Nirai Kanai chapters</a>.
[^18]: In Japanese, Kanata says the words “main house, primary line, branch house, supporting line” all in hiragana, since Kanata always speaks in hiragana. However, this can be confusing to comprehend due to the lack of kanji differentiating the words from each other. Shinobu then repeats the same 4 words, but in kanji this time. I decided to add an English equivalent to simulate a similar feeling the original line had. Thank you to my proofreader ryuseipuka for coming up with the English localization!
[^19]: Referring to Ryuseitai and Akatsuki's SS story, <a href="/submarine" target="_blank">Submarine,</a> where Ryuseitai decides to help the locals.
[^20]: Referring to <a href="/supervillain" target="_blank">Supervillain</a>, which occurs in Okinawa.
[^21]: Originally, the wordplay is <em>basuke</em> (Basketball) with <em>risuke</em> (Reschedule). I tried to make an English equivalent of that.
