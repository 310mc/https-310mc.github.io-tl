{% bubble Madara kidgrin %}
Traaansform![^2]
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata kidnod %}
there it is~ mikejima’s ‘transform’~♪

do more\~♪ do the ‘transform’ where your arms go round\~♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Madara kidyare %}
How many times are you gonna make me do this…? God’s seriously getting way too hyped up~...
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata kidgrin %}
it made kanata happy, after all~♪

thank you, mikejima. for preparing something this pretty for kanata—
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Madara kidsmilesoft %}
If you like it, then aall the hard work was worth it.

You kept saying you wanted to see the outside world, after aall~ God would always mention that there’s only boulders and saltwater around, so you wanted to see something else.

That’s why I cleared up this unused garbage dump, plowed it, and planted flower seeds. That was a preeetty while back, though.

You went outside just the other day, so I guess I’m kinda late with taking you here.

But all the seeds I planted finally sprouted, as you can see.

I didn’t expect the whole place to be covered with flowers, though… What’s in this soil? It’s waaay too fertile.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata kidnod %}
amazing, amazing! pretty, so pretty!

there are so many colors, so pretty!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata kidcurious %}
mikejima, what color is this? red? blue? yellow?
{% endbubble %}

<div class="msr-narration">
    <p>Sound of footsteps</p>
</div>

{% bubble Madara kidangry %}
—Shh! Keep quiet!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata kidworried %}
fwah!? eh? what? what is wrong, mikejima…?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Madara kidserious %}
Someone’s coming. I hear footsteps.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata kidworried %}
eh? eh? this is a confined land, though? is it the caretakers?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Madara kidserious %}
Yeah. On a general basis, regular worshipers are forbidden from entering this confined land — The vicinity around the “Abode of God”.

The only ones allowed are the selected caretakers.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata kidserious %}
yes. that is mikejima, and also grandpa and grandma[^3], who have been worshipers for a very long time.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Madara kidfrown %}
I’m still an apprentice, thooough… My parents forcibly nominated me as a caretaker, saying the two of us being the same generation means we should be able to talk on the same wavelength—

Then again, I committed a huge offense by taking God outside, so I’m prooobably seriously close to losing the right to be a caretaker.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata kidworried %}
do not say that. be a caretaker forever, mikejima.

when grandpa and grandma prepare meals for kanata, all they do is pray afterwards. it is boring.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Madara kidawkward %}
Yeah, they’re worshipers to the very core, after aaall…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Madara kidserious %}
Buuut the ones approaching don’t seem to be any of those withered up people or anything.

Their footsteps sound so rough. They’re getting closer and closer.

I have a bad feeling about this… Let’s hide from sight over there, God.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata kidworried %}
m-mm… kanata will do as mikejima says.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata kidnorsmile %}
mikejima is always right. so, doing as mikejima says will bring kanata relief.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Madara kidawkward %}
I’d prefer it if you think for yourself sometiiimes… But I guess there’s no helping that, since you’re in an environment that doesn’t really foster a “thinking brain”.

You prooobably won’t be allowed to go to school either, huh.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata kidcurious %}
school? what is that? is it fun?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata kidnod %}
almost everything mikejima teaches kanata is pretty and fun~♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Madara kidangry %}
I <em>told</em> you to stay quiet… I can finally see who’s behind those footsteps.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata kidworried %}
mmghh— do not cover kanata’s mouth. it is stressful.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Madara kidcurious %}
<th>(What’s with those guys? They’re a bunch of men dressed in black from top to bottom — They look just like a bunch of combatmen[^4] you’d find in a tokusatsu movie…)</th>

<th>(Is this really real life…? Or am I starting to confuse my delusions with reality from watching too many tokusatsu shows…?)</th>
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata kidserious %}
abyss.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Madara kidserious %}
Mm? What is it, didn’t I say to keep your mouth closed—
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata kidserious %}
those people are abyss.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Madara kidcurious %}
ABYSS? That’s the suspicious group of people the adults have been gossiping about lately, right?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata kidserious %}
mm. they are saying things like, ‘for the sake of abyss,’ and, ‘as a member of abyss’. so they are probably part of the abyss clan.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Madara kidserious %}
I’m amazed you can hear them from thiiis far away.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata kidnorsmile %}
kanata has good ears. having one’s eyes covered makes one’s hearing better.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Madara kidnorthinking %}
Hmm… ABYSS, huuuh… This is a weird place to hear a weird name…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata kidcurious %}
what is abyss? does mikejima know?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Madara kidserious %}
Mm, apparently, there’s an internal rift on the verge of happening in our religion.

Probably ‘cause since God — as in, your mom — passed away, everyone’s been reaaally shaken up.

It seems that there are forces trying to take advantage of this turmoil to gain hegemony within the religion.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata kidfrown %}
kanata does not understand such difficult topics…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata kidsmile %}
mikejima is amazing for knowing so many difficult words.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Madara kidawkward %}
Well, all my studies for school and cram classes are boooring, so I’m always reading books.

Anyway, ABYSS is rumored to be a new religious group that’s trying to split off and become independent.

It’s made up of a group of people who’ve abandoned our current religion, and are trying to establish a new one — a new-age organization, so to speak.

The adults aren’t sure who’s becoming a worshiper of the new religion, as in, the “ABYSS religion”—

In other words, the adults don’t know who has betrayed the current religion and switched sides, so it seems like things are strained right now with all of them suspecting each other.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata kidfrown %}
a dreadful story… it is forbidden to convert to another religion.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Madara kidnorthinking %}
Personally, it all sounds reaaally fishy to me… It feels like nothing more than baseless rumors.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata kidserious %}
why do you say that?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Madara kidserious %}
Those ABYSS guys don’t have any presence. There are no traces of their activity, either.

My parents perform the task of evaluating internal affairs within the religion as well, so I get to learn a lot by sneaking a peek at their documents.

I saw the name “ABYSS” in some of the documents, but there was no specific information written about them, like who the members are and such.

To an unnatural degree… Humans are bound to leave a trace as long as they exist, yet there wasn’t even an ounce of it written in there.

It sounds like just a product of their intangible delusions… As in, the name is mentioned only in rumors and documents. This is a weird way to put it, but it feels like a ghost or youkai or something.

Everyone’s holding anxiety in their hearts now that God is dead. So I thought that maaaybe they just slapped the name “ABYSS” onto that anxiety…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata kidserious %}
it is like the evil thing.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Madara kidcurious %}
Hm? Oh, yeah, that “evil thing” that’s talked about in our religion— It’s also likely a product of those intangible fantasies, riiight?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Madara kidsmirk %}
All the adults are sooo stupid, getting caught up in something that doesn’t even exist.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata kidserious %}
…………
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Madara kidawkward %}
Ahh, nah, I’m the last person to say that, considering I dream of becoming an ally of justice…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata kidshocked %}
no. mikejima… —behind you!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Madara kidsurprised %}
……!?

<th>(What!? I didn’t notice a presence! The guys in black — The ABYSS group out of nowhere came behind us—…!)</th>

<th>(These guys may look suspicious, but they move like professionals! My father forced me to watch the police’s judo tournament before, and they move just like the strong players there!)</th>
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Madara kidfrustrated %}
<th>(I let my guard down! I’m so stupid! I failed again! I shouldn’t have been relaxing here and chatting — if only we had run away immediately—)</th>

## Translation Notes

[^1]: The word for depth here is <em>fuchi</em> (淵), the same kanji used in “deep abyss” (<em>shin-en</em> 深淵)
[^2]: “Transform” (<em>henshin</em>) is what tokusatsu heroes say before transforming into their hero form.
[^3]: In Japanese, this can also refer to an old man/woman, and is not necessarily a family member or relative.
[^4]: Combatmen refer to the troopers of an antagonist group in a tokusatsu show, and are typically low-level. An example would be the <a href="https://kamenrider.fandom.com/wiki/Shocker_Combatmen" target="_blank">Shocker Combatmen</a> from Kamen Rider.
