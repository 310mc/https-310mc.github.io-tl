    <p>Flashback. A site somewhere a little far from the Abode of God. The depths[^1] of a mountain of industrial waste…</p>

{% bubble Madara kidgrin %}
Traaansform![^2]
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata kidnod %}
there it is~ mikejima’s ‘transform’~♪

do more\~♪ do the ‘transform’ where your arms go round\~♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Madara kidyare %}
How many times are you gonna make me do this…? God’s seriously getting way too hyped up~…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata kidgrin %}
it made kanata happy, after all~♪

thank you, mikejima. for preparing something this pretty for kanata—
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Madara kidsmilesoft %}
If you like it, then aall the hard work was worth it.

You kept saying you wanted to see the outside world, after aall~ God would always mention that there’s only boulders and saltwater around, so you wanted to see something else.

That’s why I cleared up this unused garbage dump, plowed it, and planted flower seeds. That was a preeetty while back, though.

You went outside just the other day, so I guess I’m kinda late with taking you here.

But all the seeds I planted finally sprouted, as you can see.

I didn’t expect the whole place to be covered with flowers, though… What’s in this soil? It’s waaay too fertile.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata kidnod %}
amazing, amazing! pretty, so pretty!

there are so many colors, so pretty!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata kidcurious %}
mikejima, what color is this? red? blue? yellow?
{% endbubble %}

<div class="msr-narration">
    <p>Sound of footsteps</p>
</div>

{% bubble Madara kidangry %}
—Shh! Keep quiet!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata kidworried %}
fwah!? eh? what? what is wrong, mikejima…?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Madara kidserious %}
Someone’s coming. I hear footsteps.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata kidworried %}
eh? eh? this is a confined land, though? is it the caretakers?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Madara kidserious %}
Yeah. On a general basis, regular worshipers are forbidden from entering this confined land — The vicinity around the “Abode of God”.

The only ones allowed are the selected caretakers.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata kidserious %}
yes. that is mikejima, and also grandpa and grandma[^3], who have been worshipers for a very long time.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Madara kidfrown %}
I’m still an apprentice, thooough… My parents forcibly nominated me as a caretaker, saying the two of us being the same generation means we should be able to talk on the same wavelength—

Then again, I committed a huge offense by taking God outside, so I’m prooobably seriously close to losing the right to be a caretaker.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata kidworried %}
do not say that. be a caretaker forever, mikejima.

when grandpa and grandma prepare meals for kanata, all they do is pray afterwards. it is boring.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Madara kidawkward %}
Yeah, they’re worshipers to the very core, after aaall…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Madara kidserious %}
Buuut the ones approaching don’t seem to be any of those withered up people or anything.

Their footsteps sound so rough. They’re getting closer and closer.

I have a bad feeling about this… Let’s hide from sight over there, God.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata kidworried %}
m-mm… kanata will do as mikejima says.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata kidnorsmile %}
mikejima is always right. so, doing as mikejima says will bring kanata relief.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Madara kidawkward %}
I’d prefer it if you think for yourself sometiiimes… But I guess there’s no helping that, since you’re in an environment that doesn’t really foster a “thinking brain”.

You prooobably won’t be allowed to go to school either, huh.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata kidcurious %}
school? what is that? is it fun?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata kidnod %}
almost everything mikejima teaches kanata is pretty and fun~♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Madara kidangry %}
I <em>told</em> you to stay quiet… I can finally see who’s behind those footsteps.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata kidworried %}
mmghh— do not cover kanata’s mouth. it is stressful.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Madara kidcurious %}
<th>(What’s with those guys? They’re a bunch of men dressed in black from top to bottom — They look just like a bunch of combatants[^4] you’d find in a tokusatsu movie…)</th>

<th>(Is this really real life…? Or am I starting to confuse my delusions with reality from watching too many tokusatsu shows…?)</th>
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata kidserious %}
abyss.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Madara kidserious %}
Mm? What is it, didn’t I say to keep your mouth closed—
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata kidserious %}
those people are abyss.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Madara kidcurious %}
ABYSS? That’s the suspicious group of people the adults have been gossiping about lately, right?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata kidserious %}
mm. they are saying things like, ‘for the sake of abyss,’ and, ‘as a member of abyss’. so they are probably part of the abyss clan.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Madara kidserious %}
I’m amazed you can hear them from thiiis far away.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata kidnorsmile %}
kanata has good ears. having one’s eyes covered makes one’s hearing better.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Madara kidnorthinking %}
Hmm… ABYSS, huuuh… This is a weird place to hear a weird name…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata kidcurious %}
what is abyss? does mikejima know?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Madara kidserious %}
Mm, apparently, there’s an internal rift on the verge of happening in our religion.

Probably ‘cause since God — as in, your mom — passed away, everyone’s been reaaally shaken up.

It seems that there are forces trying to take advantage of this turmoil to gain hegemony within the religion.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata kidfrown %}
kanata does not understand such difficult topics…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata kidsmile %}
mikejima is amazing for knowing so many difficult words.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Madara kidawkward %}
Well, all my studies for school and cram classes are boooring, so I’m always reading books.

Anyway, ABYSS is rumored to be a new religious group that’s trying to split off and become independent.

It’s made up of a group of people who’ve abandoned our current religion, and are trying to establish a new one — a new-age organization, so to speak.

The adults aren’t sure who’s becoming a worshiper of the new religion, as in, the “ABYSS religion”—

In other words, the adults don’t know who has betrayed the current religion and switched sides, so it seems like things are strained right now with all of them suspecting each other.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata kidfrown %}
a dreadful story… it is forbidden to convert to another religion.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Madara kidnorthinking %}
Personally, it all sounds reaaally fishy to me… It feels like nothing more than baseless rumors.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata kidserious %}
why do you say that?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Madara kidserious %}
Those ABYSS guys don’t have any presence. There are no traces of their activity, either.

My parents perform the task of evaluating internal affairs within the religion as well, so I get to learn a lot by sneaking a peek at their documents.

I saw the name “ABYSS” in some of the documents, but there was no specific information written about them, like who the members are and such.

To an unnatural degree… Humans are bound to leave a trace as long as they exist, yet there wasn’t even an ounce of it written in there.

It sounds like just a product of their intangible delusions… As in, the name is mentioned only in rumors and documents. This is a weird way to put it, but it feels like a ghost or youkai or something.

Everyone’s holding anxiety in their hearts now that God is dead. So I thought that maaaybe they just slapped the name “ABYSS” onto that anxiety…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata kidserious %}
it is like the evil thing.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Madara kidcurious %}
Hm? Oh, yeah, that “evil thing” that’s talked about in our religion— It’s also likely a product of those intangible fantasies, riiight?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Madara kidsmirk %}
All the adults are sooo stupid, getting caught up in something that doesn’t even exist.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata kidserious %}
…………
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Madara kidawkward %}
Ahh, nah, I’m the last person to say that, considering I dream of becoming an ally of justice…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata kidshocked %}
no. mikejima… —behind you!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Madara kidsurprised %}
……!?

<th>(What!? I didn’t notice a presence! The guys in black — The ABYSS group out of nowhere came behind us—…!)</th>

<th>(These guys may look suspicious, but they move like professionals! My father forced me to watch the police’s judo tournament before, and they move just like the strong players there!)</th>
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Madara kidfrustrated %}

<th>(…!? Was that a scream!?)</th>

<th>(This atmosphere seems unsettling…! What my father spoke about with the guest must have been true, after all!)</th>
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Souma kidangry %}
<th>(Those evil people from “Abisu” are trying to abduct God — the blue-haired child I encountered at the funeral venue!)</th>

<th>(After kidnapping, they will attempt to enshrine that child as their object of worship for a new religious group! A new living god, for a new religion!)</th>

<th>(Father spoke about such rumors! He mentioned that that is why everyone will have to be on their guard!)</th>

<th>(That is why I grew worried for that child, for God—)</th>

<th>(So I came all the way here, even intruding in that child’s dwelling. I heard my father reveal where it was in a conversation he was having earlier—)</th>

<th>(…What am I <em>doing</em>…? I was just reprimanded earlier for acting without permission…)</th>

<th>(But, this really seems to be dangerous…! It was the very first time I’d heard my father speak in such a grave tone!)</th>

<th>(We are having a crisis! An enormous crisis! Thus, as a samurai, I must make sure to fulfill my duty!)</th>

<th>(A samurai is one who fights for the sake of protecting those who are weak! Perhaps I would be scolded for calling God “weak,” but even so—!)</th>

<th>(I <em>must</em> protect that child! That child showed concern for me and patted my head! I could never overlook such a kind child falling victim to evil people!)</th>

<th>(As a samurai! No— As a human being, this is the natural thing to do!)</th>

<th>(Mmm… He was likely fighting with “Abisu” in hopes of protecting Kanata-sama…)</th>

<th>(However, they are adults… He seems to have a better build than me, but there is still no chance he could win against trained people through brute force.)</th>

{% endbubble %}

{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Souma kidserious %}
<th>(Hm, I don’t sense anyone else around. So this means it is right after God— after Kanata-sama was abducted.)</th>

<th>(It seems the “Abisu” group left after fulfilling their duty. If that is the case, it should be fine to speak to him.)</th>

Pardon me, hello.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Madara kidsurprised %}
…!? Huh!? W-What!?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Souma kidglare %}
Do you not remember who I am? You truly are rude. My head still aches as a result of your punch, you know?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Madara kidserious %}
Why’re you here…?

No, forget that! Loosen up these ropes on my hands, now!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Souma kidyare %}
I cannot stand your imperative tone, but very well. Do not move.

I am still too young to be allowed to wield a katana, so I am not used to its weight.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Madara kidcurious %}
……?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Souma kidscold %}
Kieeeeh!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Madara kidsurprised %}
…!? Ah, eep—?

That was so clooose! Where’d you pull out that katana from!?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Souma kidsmile %}
I had it behind my back this whole time. I brought over my treasured family’s katana, as I thought I may end up in a fight.

But if my father found out, I may really have to disembowel myself this time, so please do keep it a secret.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Madara kidawkward %}
Well, you did help me out… But man, that katana’s insaaanely sharp. The edge only lightly grazed the ropes, but they still sliced apart easily.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Souma kidserious %}
What on earth happened? Where is God— as in, Kanata-sama?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Madara kidfrustrated %}
He was kidnapped by those guys… by ABYSS. I tried my best to resist, but I was no match for them…

I got tied up right after Kanata-kun, and then they carried us off like luggage… Ughh, I’m so frustrated!

But I kept wriggling as best as I could, so those guys saw me as a nuisance. They just threw me here and left.

From their point of view, acquiring Kanata-kun was enough for them, I bet…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Souma kidserious %}
Hm. So, where have the “Abisu” people gone?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Madara kidserious %}
The ocean. This passage leading to the “Abode of God” is connected to all sorts of places, so they headed off to the ocean, only a few minutes ago.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Souma kidsrsthinking %}
Then we should be able to catch up in time.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Madara kidserious %}
Yeah. Lend me that katana; I’m gonna slice them down and annihilate every single one of them.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Souma kidfrown %}
Don’t say something so disturbing… Even if we had the katana, two children have no chance of fighting against a group of adults, no?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Madara kidworried %}
Then what am I supposed to *do!?* It’s all my fault that Kanata-kun—!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Souma kidnorsmile %}
Calm down. Fortunately, you are not alone.

With two people around, we have more options.

I’ve thought of something, but are you up to the task? Ermm— Oh yes, I did not ask your name, did I?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Madara kidserious %}
I’m Mikejima Madara.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Souma kidsmilesoft %}
I see. I’m Kanzaki Souma.

Mikejima-dono[^6], are you, for the sake of that God—

No. For the sake of a <em>friend</em>, are you willing to do anything?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Madara kidcurious %}
……?

{% bubble Madara kidshocked %}
—Kanata-kun!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata kidsurprised %}
fwah—
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Madara kidworried %}
Are you alright!? Are you still conscious!? Dammit, I can’t tell what sorta expression you’re making ‘cause of that cloth hiding your face!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata kidcurious %}
mikejima.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata kidnod %}
mikejima~…♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Madara kidsmilesoft %}
There, there. It’s gonna be oookay, God. You’re safe now.

I’ve come to save you.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Madara kidsigh %}
…Sorry. I’m sorry for failing to protect you — for letting you suffer through something so scary…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata kidnorsmile %}
no. kanata believed in mikejima. kanata knew that mikejima would definitely save kanata.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Madara kidawkward %}
Haha. Even though God is meant to save people, not be saved…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata kidfrown %}
kanata is still not god yet—

—mm, no. kanata probably cannot use that usual excuse anymore.

kanata has to get it together. kanata has to work hard.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata kidserious %}
kanata absolutely must become god, who will save everyone.

because kanata does not want to cause mikejima to make that face ever again.
{% endbubble %}

{% img /img/es/scoutstory/abyss/madaraorigcg.jpg %}

{% bubble Madara kid %}
…What sort of face do I have?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata kidworried %}
a horrible-looking face. it is in tatters… is mikejima alright? does it hurt?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Madara kidsmileconfident %}
I’m fiiine! Injuries like these are a medal of honor for an ally of justice!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata kidworried %}
were you fighting again? that is not good, okay? why can you not get along with everyone…?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Madara kidnorsmile %}
That’s ‘cause a world where everyone’s happy, smiling and getting along aaall the time feels creepy.

Keep this in mind: In our world, when there’s someone laughing, there’s someone angry. When there’s someone happy, there’s someone who wants to force them to be unhappy.

I’m gonna protect you from all those evil and awful people. This time, for sure — I’m never letting you make that face ever again.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata kidglare %}
that is what kanata said. do not take it, mikejima. it is forbidden to copy.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Madara kidsmilesoft %}
We’re similar, aren’t we? So it isn’t weird for us to think the same thing, riiight?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata kidangry %}
hrmph… mikejima is always arguing just for the sake of it.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Souma hidden %}
—Now, now! Those afar, listen intently! Those near, come closer and watch intently![^8]
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata kidsurprised %}
fwah!? w-what was that? that loud voice…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Madara kidsmilesoft %}
Heheh. God, remember that weird kid that was at your mom’s funeral venue?

He’s helping me rescue you.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata kidcurious %}
eh? that poor child, who got hit by mikejima?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Madara kidawkward %}
*That’s* how you remember him? He’s preeetty impressive, actually. Still a weird kid, but — if he weren’t here, I wouldn’t have been able to save you.

Our rescue mission was simple. That kid acted as a decoy and caused a huge ruckus as much as possible. Meanwhile, I sneaked inside the ship while they’re distracted.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata kidserious %}
ship?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Madara kidyare %}
You were this close to being carried off on a ship, y’knoow? You don’t remember?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata kidcurious %}
oh, kanata sort of remembers floating and swaying…?

kanata was scared and closed one’s eyes, so kanata is not sure.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Madara kidserious %}
Those ABYSS guys who abducted you were probably trying to escape overseas through that ship.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata kidserious %}
mikejima watched a movie like that before?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Madara kidsad4 %}
Yeah. Buuut I can’t believe something from a movie could happen so easily in real life—

Sooomething feels really unnatural about this…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata kidserious %}
what do you mean?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Madara kidserious %}
I learned this the hard way, but kids can barely ever win against adults. The possibility of a clever kid outwitting the dumb adults and turning the tables to his side is impossible.

Not to mention how absolutely well-trained those ABYSS guys were… They’re professionals in that line of work, I think.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Madara kidfrown %}
Could a bunch of adults like that reaaally fall for a decoy plan — a diversion trick thought up by kids?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata kidcurious %}
mm~? kanata would not know the answer…?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Madara kidsmilesoft %}
Well, whatever. I was able to save you, so it’s fine. This is enough for a happy ending, so I’ll leave all the trivial questions aside.

Anyway, we need to hurry and get out of here. Can you walk, God?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Madara kidawkward %}
I swam through the ocean, snuck into the ship, took down some guards with a stick while they weren’t looking…

Then I carried you on my back, swam back to shore and ran back here, sooo…

I’m pretty exhausted after all of that. I’d be real glad if you could walk on your own feet.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata kidfrown %}
mm~… kanata is not good at walking, but kanata will try.

to only be saved would be shameful as god, after all.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Madara kidsmileconfident %}
Yeah, try your best. I’ll lend you my shoulder if you need it.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata kidnorsmile %}
ah, kanata understands now. it was mikejima all along.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Madara kidserious %}
? What’re you talking abooout?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata kidnorsmile %}
while kanata had one’s eyes closed, kanata felt something warm every once in a while. when kanata made contact with it, it gave kanata relief.

kanata cannot recall it anymore, but it felt like when kanata would be cradled by mother.

that was mikejima all along. you were carrying kanata on your back, so it felt warm.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Madara kidcurious %}
I’m drenched wet from swimming back and forth, so I think my body is more cold than anything…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata kidsmilesoft2 %}
it does not matter. kanata would prefer thinking of it that way. it is much better than the thought of being touched by an unknown thing.

{% bubble Souma kidserious %}
…Rather, after a while of running around the area while causing a ruckus, the “Abisu” group took their leave instantly.

I feared that they uncovered our strategy, so I rushed here as soon as possible.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Madara kidnorthinking %}
Mm~… Something’s reeeal off about how those ABYSS guys operate…

But whatever, no point in thinking about that. We need to get outta here fast, maybe even take shelter with the police.

I gotta make those parents of mine work for me a little sometimes.

{% bubble Kanata v2 %}
*puka, puka~*

haa~… somehow, even [soaking] in [water] feels like something i have not done in a while.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Madara %}
Heeey, Kanata-saaan~♪

I’m finally back! I completed the mission flaaawlessly~♪ Look, I brought back the loot in question with me right heeere!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata v2 %}
i see~ fufufu, mikejima became a child who can do things if he tries, yes?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Madara yare %}
Anyone can easily do a kid errand like this, thouuugh. I can <em>really</em> feel just how much your opinion of me’s fallen off…

Even though you used to be so adorable when we were little, always acting spoiled and depending on me while calling, “Mikejima, Mikejima~♪”.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata glare %}
no, mikejima is wrong~ it is the other way around~ <em>you</em> were the one who [prided yourself] on [taking care] of me, weren’t you?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata smileconfident %}
that means <em>mikejima</em> is the one who acted spoiled and depended on me.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Madara frown %}
<em>And</em> he’s grown a silver tongue… Reaaally ticks me off.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Madara smilesoft %}
…Guess that just means we’re both no longer kids, yeaah?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata norsmile %}
yes. now that i have grown a little bit [older] since then, there are some things i understand better.

—[abyss] never [existed] in the first place.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Madara %}
Yep. I was also always curious since then, and did some research, so I’m aware of what happened to some extent.

It was confidential information for a long time, but that religious group has already disbanded, sooo yeah.

Preservation of the documents also got sloppy, and the people involved stopped keeping it a secret, ‘cause they no longer need to maintain their duty to God. Only to a certain extent, though.

That’s how I finally got the answer to a question I’ve had for a very long time.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata norsmile %}
yes. it was all a [scheme] devised by the [adults].
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata serious %}
—it started when god died.

as in, my mother.

but. even that itself was a [lie], wasn’t it?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Madara yare %}
Yeah, probably. Your mother faked her death, and vanished from sight. There’s no way we could chase after her, so who knows what she’s doing right nooow…

Honestly, it’s impossible to say if she’s even still alive.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata smilesoft2 %}
she is alive. i think so. i feel it.

whenever i come in contact with the [ocean], i feel mother.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Madara %}
It’s rare to hear you say something so God-like, isn’t iiit?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata glare %}
do not poke fun at me, please. that is a bad habit of yours, mikejima.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata serious %}
at that time, i was almost [kidnapped].

i was tied up and unable to move, and because i had my [blindfold] on, i could not tell what was going on.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata smilesoft %}
but when i closed my [eyes] out of fear, feeling [faint]… it was as if i was being [cradled] by someone the whooole time.

that might have been my mother. that warm feeling i felt.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Madara northinking %}
Yeah, that’s not impossible… Your mother officially retired from her position as God by faking her death. We don’t know the motive behind that, and it doesn’t really matter either.

She might’ve grown exhausted from reigning as God when she was really a human being all the while, or something like that.

There might’ve been a more incomprehensible, unrelatable reason behind it, as well.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Madara frown %}
But it has nothing to do with us anymore. After all, your mother abandoned her worshipers, her religion — even her own <em>child</em> — and went off on her own somewhere.

She’s not qualified to be a mother.

You don’t have any obligation to call such an awful human being your “mother”.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata awkward %}
i think there was no helping that, though. mother was a [god] muuuch longer than i ever was.

it is not her fault that she did not have enough [experience] as a human being.

it does feel lonely, though. i still miss her a little to this day.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata smilesoft2 %}
but. i am no longer a [child] yearning for his mother. after all, i now have so many warm people around me.

there is no [need] to feel lonely; not one bit.

besides, my mother likely did not abandon me because she wanted to. she tried to take me away with her at first.

but she changed her mind, and decided to stop trying.

why do you think she made that choice, mikejima?
{% endbubble %}

## Epilogue 2

{% bubble Madara northinking %}
It miiight’ve been some kinda test. She was probably trying to make sure you were capable of overcoming any sort of hardship.

At the same time, she was likely trying to confirm whether or not you have someone who’d risk their life to save you.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Madara serious %}
And as the result shows — though Souma-san and I made a move that was set up by the enemy — we did manage to overcome that hardship. We rescued you from the evil clutches of ABYSS.

Seeing us perform that feat, your mother might’ve felt relief, thinking, “This child will surely be alright.”

“You would be much happier staying in your place of belonging, instead of living a life on the run with me, with no discernable future.”
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Madara frown %}
That’s also a pretty selfish story in of itself, but well, there wasn’t really any way to prevent that. I don’t think your mother had everything her way, either.

The incident likely originated from your mother, and later our parents got involved.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata srsthinking %}
yes, it seems so… if we were to consider what [happened] afterwards.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Madara serious %}
Yeah. After that turmoil, Souma-san and I made a name for ourselves within the religion for rescuing the kidnapped Kanata-san.

Thanks to that, I got to continue being your caretaker despite all my rule-breaking, and Souma-san also got entrusted with performing rituals.

Alongside all this, our parents’ reputation improved, gaining them prestige, influence, and authority. Their kids gave them the leftovers of their accomplishments and they took it.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Madara frown %}
No… I’m sure that was the entiiire purpose of the whole scheme.

Those guys who tried to kidnap Kanata-san, too— When I investigated it, I found out they were just subordinates of my parents.

It’s no <em>wonder</em> they were so well-trained and proficient.

They were reaaal professionals meant for actual fights.

Even during the kidnapping scare, they were only <em>pretending</em> to lose to us, despite seeing right through our naïve plan.

That’s what ABYSS was — The “bad guys” contrived just to be defeated by us. Their role was to be taken down.

By creating an “enemy” — in this case, ABYSS — all the worshipers who were shaken by the death of their god would unite and work as one…

Hmph, I feel like I’ve heard of this story before…

I’m sure that even if there wasn’t a kidnapping scare, the plot would’ve still come to a close with a “and all the worshippers joined forces to defeat ABYSS~”…

Even the devil himself, the enemy of mankind, is a creation of God. When you think of it that way, the story sounds extremely and pointlessly religious.

At any rate, the “big baddie” of the Shinkai religion is ABYSS, as in “the deep sea”[^11] — They were exposing themselves all on their own with that name.

Everything’s so carelessly put together… and yet, as expected of worshipers, they were deceived by it all the same.

Well, anyway, in short… Every single thing was orchestrated by my parents and a few others.

What brought on that farce of playing superheroes was all just a combination of various people’s agendas.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata serious %}
that was mikejima’s father and mother—
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Madara serious %}
Yeah. And Souma-san’s father too; he likely got involved somewhere in the process.

Souma-san coincidentally found out about our predicament from overhearing his father’s conversation, and even learned where the concealed Abode of God is located…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Madara yare %}
Then conveniently saved us at the exact perfect time… There’s just no way that all happened by chance.

I didn’t question it at the time, but in hindsight, Souma-san must’ve been guided by his father, too.

He was given the hero role of saving us, and executed it without even knowing about it.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata norsmile %}
but even so, souma could have pretended that he heard nothing, and [feigned ignorance].

despite that, he [risked] himself to come and save us.

he came for us, who he only met once — who were not even his friends.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata smilesoft2 %}
that is all because he is a [virtuous] child.

both now and then, he is a gooood boy~♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Madara awkward %}
Back then, he said he was “simply doing what’s natural to do as a human being” or something of the liiike.

But it’s not common to find someone who can actually carry out “what’s natural to do”.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Madara smilesoft %}
That kid’s remarkable, really. Maybe it was his ignorance as a kid that made him so recklessly brave, but…

Ever since then, and even now, I have always had quite a bit of respect for that kid.

—The hero who saved us.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata norsmile %}
let’s say all of that to [him]. souma is [honest], so he will surely be happy.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Madara frown %}
Hell no. It frustrates me… I can’t <em>believe</em> the hatchling that fainted from my punch became a waaay more outstanding hero than me — the hero I yearn to be.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata frown %}
gosh… mikejima is the [opposite] of souma. you are not [honest] at all… you never have been — since a looong time ago.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Madara smileconfident %}
Well, I diiid kinda repeat many mistakes, get beaten down by reality, and then sulked over it and became distorted all over.

I can’t be a kid who dreams anymore.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata norsmile %}
is that so… i personally still have [dreams] sometimes.

[dreams] of those days.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata smilesoft2 %}
back then, i was [blindfolded], and i could not see much — so my [dreams] are mostly pitch dark.

but i clearly remember others’ [voices] and [touch].

that time — after my mother abducted me, she probably [cradled] me the whole time.

while doing something [mother]-like after so long, she began to cry.

it trickled down on me. something salty and warm.

i do not know the reason behind those [tears]. only mother knows.

maybe she was happy to be free and cradle her child… maybe she felt sorrow knowing we may have to separate.

i am not sure what it could be, but i will never eeever forget it.

that warmth, and that salty feeling.

mother tasted like the [ocean].
{% endbubble %}

## Epilogue 3

{% bubble Madara smilesoft %}
Well, either way; good for you, Kanata-san. I’m not proud to say it, but I don’t have a single good memory with my mom, y’knoow?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata yare %}
you should try to get along with her… mikejima’s [mother] is clearly [alive], after all.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Madara grin %}
Hahaha. Maybe it was a gooood thing your mother left you.

Moms are only overbearing once you hit puberty. I think you would’ve toootally fought with her if she was by your side then.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata norsmile %}
yes, maybe so. but i want to have had those [fights].

i want to have had those normal [parent-child], [family]-like things.

that is my one true [regret] — it aaalways lingered in me, that i even held onto [this].

the last remaining [connection] with my mother.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Madara serious %}
Ahh, that cremation urn, yeah? That was empty from the very start, right?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata norsmile %}
yes. my mother only [pretended] to be [dead], so there was never a [corpse] from the very start. that of course means no [remains] nor [ashes], either.

it is because the [cremation urn] was empty that i knew my mother was still [alive].

this [cremation urn] was meant to be that sort of [message]. there is no deeper [meaning] to it.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Madara curious %}
She disappeared on her own, but she still wanted it to be known that she’s alive?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata smileconfident %}
yes. [mother] is alive. and she is watching over me from somewhere far away—

i would like to [interpret] it in good light, for it to be that sort of [message] to me.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Madara smirk %}
She might’ve just pushed the things she deemed unnecessary onto you, y’knoow? Like the position of God~ The empty cremation urn might’ve actually been that sort of message.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata glare %}
my [mother] is not like mikejima; she would not say something so [unkind], okay~?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kaoru v2 %}
Heeey, Kanata-kuun~ *<th>(waves)</th>*
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata curious %}
kaoru.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kaoru v2 %}
I knew you’d be nearby somewhere. You’ve always been the type to make others run errands without doing much yourself, yeah?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata serious %}
doing so is an old [custom]… but, that aside, is there [something] you needed from me?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kaoru awkward %}
Nah, it’s not a big deal or anything… See, Souma-kun’s doing a huge cleanup of the club room, so we should go help him out, as alumni of the Marine Life Club.

The club room’s a mess — mostly ‘cause of all the water tanks you left behind. So you should at least tidy up that part, right?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kaoru v2 %}
I know I’m late to say this, but — it’s just simple courtesy to clean up after yourself when leaving, y’know~

When something meaningful is left behind somewhere, the remaining people around will start wondering if there’s some sort of message behind it.

Like that “cremation urn,” yeah?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata serious %}
…………
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kaoru smilesoft2 %}
Heheh, I’m glad for you, Kanata-kun.

I’m happy to know that your mother didn’t pass away in the end.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata curious %}
…did you tell kaoru everything, mikejima?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Madara serious %}
Nah. It sounded like Souma-san already told him the story to a certain extent, so I <em>did</em> fill in a bit of the rest.

‘Cause if people don’t get any explanation, they might get curious and investigate.

Buuut in terms of the cremation urn, I only explained that it’s one of the items related to the case.

I did explain enough to hint at the truth, but the explanation got tedious halfwaaay… I mean, I personally hadn’t reached a conclusion yet, anyway.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata serious %}
so in other words, kaoru [deduced] it, and reached the [truth] by himself.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata norsmile %}
that is incredible. i expect nothing less from the son of a [scholar].[^12]
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kaoru v2 %}
Thanks. That’s the best compliment I could ever get.

But I think Souma-kun figured out the truth, too.

That kid’s grown a lot more than we thought. He may look like an idiot, but he’s always strangely been clever.

I think he’s just always considerate of his seniors, so he won’t ask for more details if they don’t wanna talk about it.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata norsmile %}
ahh, that is just like him.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata awkward %}
but, yes, that is true… that boy would always look at me with [sparkles] in his [eyes], both back then and now.

it makes me want to look good and reliable in front of him… to [pretend] as if everything connected to my embarrassing [past] never happened.

that is exactly why [once again], i asked mikejima to [collect] this [cremation urn] for me.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kaoru v2 %}
I know I keep saying this, but how about doing it yourself? It’s something related to you, so why not do it without leaving it to someone else?
{% endbubble %}

## Epilogue 4

{% bubble Kaoru v2 %}
That part about you is exactly like your mom, Kanata-kun.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata serious %}
…? kaoru, have you met my mother before?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kaoru v2 %}
Nope, not once. I mean, it’s not like I really had any connection with you guys in the past.

It’s just that I can sorta imagine what kind of person your mother was, based on the little I’ve heard. I think she was probably just like you, Kanata-kun.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata serious %}
well, that is because she was raised in the same kind of [environment] as me.

she was raised to live her life as a [god], not a [human].
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kaoru v2 %}
And everyone couldn’t bear to see such a “pitiful person,” so they all poked their noses in to do something about it, I bet. Just like how Souma-kun and Mikejima-kun tried to support you and save you, Kanata-kun.

That might be the real truth behind the whole incident. And Kanata-kun, you might’ve been tracing after your mother’s life subconsciously.

After all, you also eventually quit being a “god” before I even knew it, yeah? Just like your mother did.

Don’t you think your current feelings would have a lot of overlap with your mother’s feelings when she quit back then?

It would’ve been so much easier to completely vanish without a single trace, without ever passing on a message. If you were to take into account how the people left behind would feel, yeah? Tidying up the aftermath is tough on them, after all.

But despite that, you two made sure to leave behind something.

Why do you think that is?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata smile %}
…ahh, i see. now i get it. thanks to kaoru, i think i finally understand my mother’s [feelings] back then.

i personally love everyone.

surely, my mother felt the same.

so she wanted to remain somewhere within the people she loves, didn’t she?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata smilesoft2 %}
that is why she left something behind. even if it is with something small — even if it makes those left behind have lingering feelings of sadness and regret.

she wanted to be on their minds — to be remembered.

it is because she wanted to remain in everyone’s [hearts] that she left something behind, yes?

that is all there is to it.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Souma curious %}
Shinkai-dono\~! Mikejima-dono\~! And Hakaze-dono, I suppose!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kaoru awkward %}
Is it just me, or am I the only one who got the “whatever” treatment?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata smile %}
fufu, if anything, it feels like you are getting [special treatment] from souma. it makes me feel jealous.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kaoru v2 %}
Ohh? You feel jealous of me, too? That kinda makes me happy.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Souma %}
What are you discussing? Regardless, look! The sky is crying!

In other words, it is raining! I believe it would be best if everyone were to take shelter from the rain in the club room, before all of you become drenched wet.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata serious %}
i am already [drenched wet], though~?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Souma yare %}
You truly are… You will only catch a cold again, Shinkai-dono. It worries me. You need to wipe your body and warm yourself up.

That is another reason why taking shelter is necessary. I would be grateful if you could help clean the club room as well, while we’re there.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Madara %}
Yup. It’s much more efficient to do things with other people’s help instead of all by yourself, after aaall.

I’ll personally help you out. ‘Cause that’ll make us even for when you helped me rescue Kanata-san in the paaast.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Souma curious %}
That is just like you to say, Mikejima-dono, but wouldn’t the favor given and the service received in return be unproportionate to each other…?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Madara grin %}
…Hahaha! ♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata curious %}
…? what is so funny, mikejima?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Madara smilesoft %}
Nah, it’s probably all just a coincidence, and there are no gods or ghosts in this world, but…

It’s as if your mom got worried seeing you all by yourself, so she sent rain down in hopes that everyone would mingle with you.

Even though that’s entirely impossible, the thought of it made me laugh.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata norsmile %}
fufu. yes, that’s right. mother is no longer a [god], so she cannot make [rain] fall.

but. mhm, i hope that’s true.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata smilesoft2 %}
—thank you, mother.

as you can see, i can assure you that i am living quite happily.

so please, don’t cry anymore.

## Translation Notes

[^1]: The word for depth here is <em>fuchi</em> (淵), the same kanji used in “deep abyss” (<em>shin-en</em> 深淵)
[^2]: “Transform” (<em>henshin</em>) is what tokusatsu heroes say before transforming into their hero form.
[^3]: In Japanese, this can also refer to an old man/woman, and is not necessarily a family member or relative.
[^4]: Combatants refer to the troopers of an antagonist group in a tokusatsu show, and are typically low-level. An example would be the <a href="https://kamenrider.fandom.com/wiki/Shocker_Combatmen" target="_blank">Shocker Combatmen</a> from Kamen Rider.
[^5]: Souma calls Kanata with “sama” to show respect to his status as a god.
[^6]: Young Souma calls Madara by “Mikejima-dono” just like present Souma, but as a young kid the <em>dono</em> is in hiragana, whereas present Souma says <em>dono</em> with the kanji 殿.
[^7]: He says <em>puka puka</em> in Japanese here, which can mean bubbling or floating.
[^8]: This is a classic samurai catchphrase from the old ages, typically used in stories set in those days.
[^9]: Here, Souma says <em>kami-sama</em> (God). This is different from the way Madara refers to young Kanata, which is simply <em>kami</em>.
[^10]: This is a motto that samurais live by. The quote comes from Confucius.
[^11]: As mentioned in Chapter 5, abyss can mean the deep sea, the same word as Kanata’s last name.
[^12]: Kaoru’s mother was a marine biologist.
