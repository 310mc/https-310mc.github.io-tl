{% bubble Souma kidnorsmile %}
I aaam~ free![^1]

<th>(Now, what to do! It is time to think, Souma! There is only half of my appointed free time left! That means, um, around thirty minutes!)</th>

<th>(I must use this time wisely on something— I must do *something!* Or it would be a waste!)</th>
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Souma kidsigh2 %}
…However, as of this moment, I am simply hungry.

I feel as though Father forgot about my meal.

<th>(What shall I do…? It is not possible to fight when you’re hungry.)</th>

<th>(Usually, Mother prepares the meal for me… However, she is soon to give birth to my adorable little brother.)</th>

<th>(Due to “pregnancy,” she cannot move. That is why it is an unavoidable matter. She cannot walk such long distances while dragging her heavy body.)</th>

<th>(—Even if it is the funeral of a prestigious person that our clan cannot disregard.)</th>
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Souma kidserious %}
<th>(Indeed, I have heard that someone passed away.)</th>

<th>(That person is said to be an important, highly-esteemed figure.)</th>
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Souma kidfrown2 %}
<th>(Ah, no… I will be reprimanded if I say “person,” won’t I?)</th>

<th>(Because I heard that that person is “God”.)</th>

<th>(…A funeral, for *God?* Does God die, too? Mm~?)</th>
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Souma kidnorsmile %}
<th>(Well, if God truly is to die, then surely they did! My father and mother would never be mistaken with their words!)</th>
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Souma kidsad4 %}
<th>(Uu, thinking is only making me hungrier. I am starving… Not even the great Taikō himself would expect someone to starve to death in this prosperous modern Japan…)</th>

<th>(Maybe I should ask Father to make food for me~… But he seemed busy, and he always says that a man mustn’t be in the kitchen.)</th>
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Souma kidserious %}
<th>(Mm, then I have no choice but to search for food on my own.)</th>

<th>(I should be able to find something nutritious, be it insect or beast.)</th>

<th>(Ah, no. Now that I look, there is food lined up all around.)</th>

<th>(Am I hallucinating…?)</th>
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Souma kidsmilesoft %}
<th>(I do not understand, but this must be divine grace! In other words, erm, God has come to help!)</th>

<th>(I will show my gratitude and eat well.)</th>

<th>(…Is it alright to eat this without permission? Will I be reprimanded? But there is nobody around for me to get permission…?)</th>

<th>(Besides… Uuu~ I am very hungry!)</th>

Thank you for the food.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Souma kidsigh2 %}
<em><th>(Munch, munch)</th></em>… Uuu, what a dense flavor. Mother’s meals are much gentler to the taste.

<th>(Ah! Someone is coming! Oh no, if someone sees me sneaking food, it would be shameful! It is a lowly deed that is unbecoming of a samurai son!)</th>

<th>(I-I must hide somewhere… The curtains hanging off that table should hide me effectively.)</th>

<th>(Hurry, Souma! Ei-yah—!)</th>

is someone there? is it mikejima?

{% bubble Kanata kid %}
…mikejima.

this is not… him. the smell is different.

<em><th>(licks)</th></em>… mm, the taste is different, too.

Eeeeek!? W-What are you doing all of a sudden!? Are you a youkai!?

{% bubble Kanata kid %}
who may you be?

{% bubble Souma kidworried %}
I-I ask the same in return — who are you? What are you doing here?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata kidnorsmile %}
kanata is not doing anything.[^2]

in a way, kanata is doing not doing anything.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Souma kidcurious %}
?????
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata kidcurious %}
do you not understand, human child?

are kanata’s words hard to understand?
{% endbubble %}

K-Katana? No, you said “Kanata,” correct? Is that—…?

Gwafuh!?

{% bubble Madara kidsmilesoft %}
Woooops, I got ahead of myself and punched him, but who even is this kid? Do you know, God?[^3]
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata kid %}
kanata is not god yet, so kanata does not know anything.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata kidglare %}
and. mikejima, you are late to return.

{% bubble Madara kid %}
Sooorry~ It was a liiittle tough to figure out a sneaky entry route—

## Translation Notes

[^1]: Young Souma speaks about the same as present Souma, in old-fashioned Japanese (*dearu*). Unlike present Souma, sometimes he speaks a bit more child-like, such as using words like *kana* (maybe) instead of a more formal/old-fashioned way.
[^2]: Young Kanata speaks differently from the present. While he does speak in hiragana only, there are no quotation marks around any of his words, likely due to how short his sentences are (so there's no need to separate the words from each other). He also refers to himself in third-person (*kanata* instead of his first-person pronoun in the present time, *boku*). Last but not least, he speaks in old-fashioned Japanese, as well as using an imperative, commanding tone, akin to a high-being ordering those below him. In comparison, present Kanata speaks in polite speech, including his requests (always saying *kudasai* when asking someone to do something).
[^3]: Young Madara speaks basically the same as present Madara, with his elongated vowels at the end of the sentence.
