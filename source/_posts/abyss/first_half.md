I aaam~ free![^1]

<th>(Now, what to do! It is time to think, Souma! There is only half of my appointed free time left! That means, um, around thirty minutes!)</th>

<th>(I must use this time wisely on something— I must do *something!* Or it would be a waste!)</th>
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Souma kidsigh2 %}
…However, as of this moment, I am simply hungry.

I feel as though Father forgot about my meal.

<th>(What shall I do…? It is not possible to fight when you’re hungry.)</th>

<th>(Usually, Mother prepares the meal for me… However, she is soon to give birth to my adorable little brother.)</th>

<th>(Due to “pregnancy,” she cannot move. That is why it is an unavoidable matter. She cannot walk such long distances while dragging her heavy body.)</th>

<th>(—Even if it is the funeral of a prestigious person that our clan cannot disregard.)</th>
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Souma kidserious %}
<th>(Indeed, I have heard that someone passed away.)</th>

<th>(That person is said to be an important, highly-esteemed figure.)</th>
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Souma kidfrown2 %}
<th>(Ah, no… I will be reprimanded if I say “person,” won’t I?)</th>

<th>(Because I heard that that person is “God”.)</th>

<th>(…A funeral, for *God?* Does God die, too? Mm~?)</th>
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Souma kidnorsmile %}
<th>(Well, if God truly is to die, then surely they did! My father and mother would never be mistaken with their words!)</th>
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Souma kidsad4 %}
<th>(Uu, thinking is only making me hungrier. I am starving… Not even the great Taikō himself would expect someone to starve to death in this prosperous modern Japan…)</th>

<th>(Maybe I should ask Father to make food for me~… But he seemed busy, and he always says that a man mustn’t be in the kitchen.)</th>
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Souma kidserious %}
<th>(Mm, then I have no choice but to search for food on my own.)</th>

<th>(I should be able to find something nutritious, be it insect or beast.)</th>

<th>(Ah, no. Now that I look, there is food lined up all around.)</th>

<th>(Am I hallucinating…?)</th>
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Souma kidsmilesoft %}
<th>(I do not understand, but this must be divine grace! In other words, erm, God has come to help!)</th>

<th>(I will show my gratitude and eat well.)</th>

<th>(…Is it alright to eat this without permission? Will I be reprimanded? But there is nobody around for me to get permission…?)</th>

<th>(Besides… Uuu~ I am very hungry!)</th>

Thank you for the food.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Souma kidsigh2 %}
<em><th>(Munch, munch)</th></em>… Uuu, what a dense flavor. Mother’s meals are much gentler to the taste.

<th>(Ah! Someone is coming! Oh no, if someone sees me sneaking food, it would be shameful! It is a lowly deed that is unbecoming of a samurai son!)</th>

<th>(I-I must hide somewhere… The curtains hanging off that table should hide me effectively.)</th>

<th>(Hurry, Souma! Ei-yah—!)</th>

{% bubble Souma kidserious %}
…? …?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Souma kidworried %}
<th>(What? Who!? A ruffian~!?)</th>

<th>(Who is this!? What strange attire…?)</th>
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata kid %}
is someone there? is it mikejima?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Souma kidcurious %}
<th>(Huh? Eh? What was that?)</th>

<th>(Their voice has a strange reverberation… I could not pick up what was said.)</th>
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata kid %}
…mikejima.

this is not… him. the smell is different.

<em><th>(licks)</th></em>… mm, the taste is different, too.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Souma kidworried %}
Eeeeek!? W-What are you doing all of a sudden!? Are you a youkai!?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata kid %}
who may you be?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Souma kidworried %}
I-I ask the same in return — who are you? What are you doing here?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata kidnorsmile %}
kanata is not doing anything.[^2]

in a way, kanata is doing not doing anything.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Souma kidcurious %}
?????
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata kidcurious %}
do you not understand, human child?

are kanata’s words hard to understand?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Souma kidshocked %}
K-Katana? No, you said “Kanata,” correct? Is that—…?
{% endbubble %}

    <p>Sound of a punch</p>

{% bubble Souma kidsurprised %}
Gwafuh!?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Madara kidsmilesoft %}
Whooops, I got ahead of myself and punched him, but who even is this kid? Do you know, God?[^3]
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata kid %}
kanata is not god yet, so kanata does not know anything.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata kidglare %}
and. mikejima, you are late to return.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Madara kid %}
Sooorry~ It was a liiittle tough to figure out a sneaky entry route—

    <p>Present time. First year of ES’s establishment, early February…</p>
</div>

{% bubble Kaoru awkward %}
Man, that was seriously a disaster, Souma-kun!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Souma sigh %}
…………
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kaoru v2 %}
That seriously freaked me out~ I show up to the club room after so long, and the first thing I see is you collapsed on the floor, covered in blood.

I thought a murder happened here, y’know? I almost called the police.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Souma %}
…You are unreasonably noisy as always, Hakaze-dono. Is there any way you could shut that mouth of yours?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kaoru serious %}
You don’t sound so good, Souma-kun. You okay? Are you anemic?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Souma yare %}
I am ashamed of myself. Of all people to see me in this unsightly shape, it is Hakaze-dono…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kaoru v2 %}
Aww, there’s nothing to be ashamed of, though~ It was just an accident, right?

Right, what was it… You were cleaning the club room, when something like an urn fell on your head, right?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Souma sigh2 %}
Mm… Truly a disaster.

Even though I actually conduct myself in a proper manner every day, unlike you…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kaoru v2 %}
I’ve been taking things seriously lately, too~ Really, I mean it! I’ve been so serious that my old fans have been spreading a theory that I’ve been replaced by someone else.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Souma frown %}
Hmph. You are obviously not someone else. You may have been frivolous for a long span of time, but you had virtue, as well.

If they are truly spreading such rumors, then it can be assumed that they do not know you as a person.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kaoru curious %}
Souma-kun, are you growing to understand me? *Me?*
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Souma frown %}
…No, I do not understand you. Not now, nor in the past.

A blockhead like me, able to understand others… Something like that is but a dream.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kaoru v2 %}
What’s wrong? You’re really gloomy~ There isn’t really anyone in the Marine Life Club as always, so are you feeling lonely all by yourself? Should I show up more often?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Souma glare %}
That is unwarranted help. How exhausting.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kaoru awkward %}
Um, I’m just worried about you…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Souma frown %}
I haven’t fallen so far down so as to need your worry.

Nevertheless, Hakaze-dono, perhaps there is purpose in your arrival.

Help me with tidying the club room. I was knocked unconscious by an unnecessary accident, so nothing has been cleaned up yet.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kaoru yare %}
Ehh~ What a pain…
{% endbubble %}

<div class="msr-narration">
    <p>Souma glares</p>
</div>

{% bubble Kaoru awkward %}
Ah, um, yes, got it, I’ll help.

Don’t glare at me, it’s scary… You’ll cause misunderstandings if you do that, okay?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Souma %}
I was not glaring at you. However, I could not help but stare at the urn that fell on me — I feel as though I’ve seen it before.

Ahh, I remember; it was the funeral venue of that day.

This urn looks exactly the same as the one in that funeral venue— No, rather, I feel that it is somewhat similar to it.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kaoru shocked %}
Ueh!? Hold on, *what!?* An urn from a funeral venue…? That means…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Souma %}
Indeed, this may be a cremation urn.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kaoru surprised %}
Ueeehhh… W-Why’s there something like <em>that</em> in our club room!?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Souma %}
Perhaps the previous club president, Shinkai-dono, left it behind accidentally?

No, no matter how little common sense he may have, there is no way he would casually take such an important item out of his household.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Souma frown %}
Mm~ What a mystery…

Actually, he is the very definition of mystery to me, be it now or long ago…
{% endbubble %}

{% img /img/es/scoutstory/abyss/2_2.jpg %}

{% bubble Kanata kidsleeping %}
zz, zz…♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Madara kidserious %}
God\~ God\~ Wake up!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata kidworried %}
ouh…

kanata has told you before, mikejima. kanata is not god yet.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Madara kidsmilesoft %}
Mhm, you’re not God, you’re a little baby. Sooo why were you asleep?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata kidcurious %}
kanata does not know why, either. kanata fell asleep without realizing.

kanata is easily influenced by humans. kanata is easily dyed, like water.

that is why, being by this sleeping child made kanata sleep… maybe.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Souma kidsleeping %}
…………
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Madara kidcurious %}
Who even is he? I punched him out of reflex ‘cause he was about to touch God, buuut…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Madara kidnorsmile %}
Well, whatever. Anyway, I got eeeverything prepared.

Just like I thought, the old men are starting to talk to each other at the banquet, to decide what to do next.

We might be able to sneak off to see the remains if we go now.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata kidnorsmile %}
kanata can meet mother?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata kidfrownshake %}
ah— no. kanata must not call her by “mother”. kanata will be scolded.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Madara kidfrown %}
It doesn’t make sense that they get angry over that. What’s wrong with calling your mother by “mother”?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata kidsad3 %}
but. mother is god.

……mother is god. so why did mother die?

do you know, mikejima?

kanata does not.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Madara kidnorsmile %}
I dunno why, either. I’m an idiot, after aaall~

I’m pretty incompetent, unlike my little sister. They always scold me while saying that.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata kidnorsmile %}
always being scolded. both kanata and mikejima.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Madara kidsmile %}
Mhm, that’s why we were able to become friends.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Souma kidfrownshake %}
Mm… Mmm~…?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Madara kidshocked %}
Uh-oooh, this kid’s about to wake up.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Madara kid %}
Should I hit him agaaain? Enjoy your time in dreamlaaand~♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata kidworried %}
c-cease doing anything scary. kanata shivers when seeing you hit humans.

this child has not done anything wrong. you must not hit.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Madara kidgrin %}
Sure, sure. As God commands~♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Souma kidsurprised %}
……Y-You two, who are you?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Madara kidsurprised %}
Oh crap! Ugh, now he’s awake!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Souma kidglare %}
Y-You ruffian… I will call over an adult!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Madara kidawkward %}
We can’t have thaaat…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Madara kidgrin %}
Fuhaha! Okay, I’ve got nooo choice! I’ll just have to keep your mouth shut — permanently~♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Souma kidscold %}
Y-You dare try to kill me!? C-Curse you, y-you barbarian!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Madara kidcurious %}
The heck… He talks weird.

God is also weird; am I the ooonly one here who’s proper?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Madara kidyare %}
I mean, I knew that already, buuut… Things really are crazy over here, huh…
{% endbubble %}

## Chapter 3

<div class="msr-narration">
    <p>A few minutes later. In the mansion, at the far end of the funeral venue…</p>
</div>

{% bubble Madara kid %}
Alright, mission start!

Right, God, listen carefully. We’re now undercover agents. We’re gonna sneak in without anyone noticing us, and destroy the secret weapon the adults are hiding.

I saw a movie like that once.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata kidcurious %}
movie… i do not understand, but what is important is that mikejima seems to be having fun.

kanata is having fun, too. does this mean… this is, fun?

kanata feels shaky.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Madara kidsmilesoft %}
That’s ‘cause God is usually holed up inside that dark liiittle den. Just being able to move your body around must feel good.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata kidsigh2 %}
it is tiring, though. kanata’s legs feel heavy.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Madara kid %}
I’ll carry ya on my back.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata kidnod %}
that is most helpful. mikejima is a good kid~
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Madara kidnorsmile %}
It’s just ‘cause I’d hate to get dragged down and fail the mission after how long it took to get here. It’d be especially bad if my parents caught us. They’ll probably get super angry at me.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata kidworried %}
kanata apologizes for such a troublesome request, mikejima.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Madara kidgrin %}
I don’t miiind. I get how you feel, aaand I’m having fun as well.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Madara kidserious %}
<th>(—The other day, “Kanata-kun’s” mom passed away — the one who was worshiped as a living god in our religion.)</th>

<th>(Today is her funeral. As for me, I’m trying to get Kanata-kun to at least meet with her remains, ‘cause the pitiful Kanata-kun unfortunately couldn’t get to meet her in her final moments.)</th>
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Madara kidsrsthinking %}
<th>(Yeah… I’m not wrong to do this, am I? This is justice, riiight?)</th>

<th>(I’m an ally of justice who saves pitiful kids.)</th>

<th>(I’m <em>nothing</em> like my father and mother.)</th>
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata kidcurious %}
…mikejima?

what is wrong? is kanata heavy?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Madara kidsmilesoft %}
Nope, you’re suuuper light! Are you sure you’re eating enough food?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata kid %}
kanata is eating, but… kanata is performing shōjin kessai.[^4]
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Madara kidserious %}
Shojin-what now?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata kid %}
shōjin kessai.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Madara kidgrin %}
Mhm, dunno it! I don’t think about things I don’t know!

I’ll look it up on the net later. Anyway, the remains should be in the room right at the end of the hall.

But it’s the remains of God, so there might be people patrolling the place in case someone tries to mess around.

If there’s anyone like that, I’ll act as a decoy and attract their attention.

That’s when you can sneak inside the room and meet with your mother, Kanata-san.[^5]
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata kidnorsmile %}
mm. that is most helpful, mikejima.

thank you for always being kind to kanata.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata kidsigh %}
kanata would like to repay you, but kanata is not god yet, so kanata cannot do anything. how useless…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Madara kidsmug %}
I don’t need any repayment! I’m just doing what’s natural to do as a human being! Heh~♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata kidnorthinking %}
i see. this is natural for a human being.

being kind to someone is natural.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata kidsmilesoft2 %}
then, kanata loves human beings.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Souma kidangry %}
<th>(…What are those two doing? They managed to run away earlier, but I am going to get an explanation from them this time!)</th>

<th>(They are sneaking about in the corners of this mansion… Are they thieves? Then I shall punish them for their misconduct! It will act as revenge for the uncouth behavior earlier, as well!)</th>
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Souma kidserious %}
<th>(However… Looking at them again, they truly are strange.)</th>

<th>(Especially that blue-haired child… What is that pompous attire?)</th>

<th>(It does not appear to be what a regular human would wear.)</th>

<th>(It is much more like that of an exorcist’s from an illustrated, fictional story; or a celestial maiden, or even a god—)</th>
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Souma kidcurious %}
<th>(…God? Ah, didn’t that child call oneself “God”…?)</th>
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata kid %}
human child.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Souma kidshocked %}
…!? Huh!? W-When did you appear behind me!?

A blunder once again! I did not notice any presence!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata kidworried %}
shh~… silence. kanata does not understand much, but it seems that it will be a problem if kanata is caught right now.

it is called hide-and-seek. do you understand?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Souma kidserious %}
Hide-and-seek…?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata kidsmile2 %}
mm. one must hide without being caught. look, this place should be good.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Souma kidcurious %}
I-I must hide behind this cabinet? Even me? Why?

<th>(Wait, is this child simply from the neighborhood? It seems that a hide-and-seek game is occuring—…)</th>

<th>(Oh yes, didn’t I find this child concealed out of sight earlier?)</th>
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Souma kidnorsmile %}
<th>(That is a relief, then.)</th>
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Souma kidfrown2 %}
<th>(No, no, no, wait. No normal child would be casually walking around in such strange attire.)</th>

<th>(There is something about this child that is not normal.)</th>
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata kidnorsmile %}
ah, mikejima is calling. so, kanata must go now.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Souma kidsurprised %}
Ah— Wait—
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata kidnod %}
there, there. ♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Souma kidcurious %}
…? W-Why are you patting me?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata kidnorsmile %}
does it no longer hurt? our mikejima was rude earlier, was he not?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata kidsmilesoft %}
but. please forgive mikejima.

because, mikejima is always doing the right thing.
{% endbubble %}

    <p>Back to the present…</p>
</div>

{% bubble Souma %}
That is everything that I witnessed.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kaoru yare %}
Mhm. I dunno if my comprehension level’s low, or your explanation’s bad, but it doesn’t really make any sense.

So what are you getting at…? Is it just that you met two strange kids at someone’s funeral long ago, or…?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Souma %}
Ahh, no, I forgot to mention their names, but… I believe the children I encountered were Shinkai-dono and Mikejima-dono.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kaoru northinking %}
Oh yeah, those two are childhood friends, aren’t they?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kaoru awkward %}
Kanata-kun often happily talks about “Mikejima” this or “Mikejima” that, so there was a time I was kinda jealous.

Not that there’s really any point to feeling jealous… I can’t win against something that’s been built up for so long.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Souma %}
Indeed… I could have also been in such a position, but I would continue to only cross paths with them, you see.

My family is not typically involved with Shinkai-dono’s household in the first place. Mikejima-dono’s household is full-time work, whereas we, the Kanzaki household, are much more akin to part-time work.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kaoru frown %}
I don’t really get it. You really are bad at explaining, aren’t you, Souma-kun?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Souma glare %}
You’re simply slow-witted.

Either way, that matters not… What is important here is the supposed “cremation urn” that hit my head.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kaoru curious %}
Ahh, yeah. So is that really a cremation urn?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Souma %}
I do not know… I mustered the courage to open the lid and check inside, but…

To my surprise, it was empty. There were no ashes or remains of the departed.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kaoru v2 %}
Ah, really? Whew. It’s not all gross or anything, but—

I seriously didn’t wanna think that we’d spent three years in this club room, without ever realizing that the remains of someone we don’t know were in here, too.

But really, I just don’t get it. What <em>is</em> this urn, then?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Souma %}
It’s unclear, but I believe it has some connection to Shinkai-dono’s household.

Look, it has their family crest— Well, I am not sure if I can call it that, but there is a symbol carving that identifies the urn as theirs.

It is considered impious for other households — or rather, for human beings — to use it.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kaoru awkward %}
You explain it like Kanata-kun isn’t a human being, huh…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Souma %}
I do not know how much you know about them, but Shinkai-dono’s family is a peculiar household.

And to the unusual Shinkai clan — The Kanzaki household and Mikejima-dono’s household are subordinates.

I would like you to understand those relationships between us, at the very least.

Shinkai-dono is like the lord, and we are like the vassals.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kaoru v2 %}
Mhm. We’re a pretty old household too, so I know there are some anachronic relationships like that to this day.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kaoru yare %}
We’re all modern kids, so it all sounds absurd, y’know~ But I know it holds a heavy weight to some people.

So yeah, even if it’s something you can’t understand, you still gotta respect it.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Souma v3 %}
That is the correct mindset to have. You have pleasant things to say sometimes, Hakaze-dono.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kaoru grin %}
Oh? Souma-kun complimented me! What a rarity, maybe it’ll even rain tomorrow?[^6]
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Souma frown %}
Do not make a fool of me… Regardless, this is a peculiar twist of fate.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kaoru serious %}
What do you mean? Could you not use such outdated terminology for everything?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Souma %}
There was a similar uproar back then, too.

A case that was supposed to contain the remains, ashes, or corpse of the deceased— was found to be empty when the lid was opened.

It may be a mere coincidence, but strangely, the scenarios overlap.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kaoru curious %}
Mm? I thought this was gonna be a locked-room murder, but it’s actually a vanishing body twist?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Souma curious %}
What are you talking about?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kaoru v2 %}
The drama I’m acting in is your typical mystery, so~
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Souma v3 %}
Fufu. It is easy to be influenced by the roles we play in our work. Whenever I work as an actor, I grow emotionally attached to the role I am playing, and become one with it.

I remember a specific moment when this occurred to me, as well. Just the other day, when I returned to my family's home, I accidentally uttered a harsh line from a role I had played in a movie—

And my mother and little brother were frightened of me, saying “Our eldest son became a delinquent!”
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kaoru v2 %}
Sounds like an interesting story, but we’re going waaay off-topic here~
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Souma %}
Mm, my apologies…

…As I mentioned earlier, it seems that at the time, Shinkai-dono and Mikejima-dono’s aim was to visit the remains of the figure who passed away.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kaoru serious %}
But the remains they were trying to meet disappeared — is what happened?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Souma %}
It seems so. When Shinkai-dono and Mikejima-dono opened the coffin and peeked in, they did not find any body laid to rest there.

Naturally, everyone in the area caused a huge uproar.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Souma frown %}
Because of that, not only were the two who secretly went to see the remains suspected of being the culprits who hid it— But I, also, was suspected, as I was in the vicinity.

I was severely chastised and interrogated, and for a while I was even forbidden to roam about freely.

And naturally, for that exact reason, I lost contact with Shinkai-dono and Mikejima-dono, whom I did not typically have much interaction with.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kaoru shocked %}
Woah, woah, wait. Isn’t that <em>way</em> too severe!? I doubt you were the culprits behind it, and even if you were, you were just *kids.*

You were *chastised…*? That’s so awful. It’s way too old-fashioned.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Souma yare %}
It was only as far as a spanking, though. It was the first time I saw my father with such a terrifying expression, that I have nightmares of it to this day.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kaoru curious %}
Ahh~ The more old-fashioned a family is, the scarier the dad, right? He comes from a time when the patriarchy was strong, after all. I totally getcha, it’s the same thing in my family~
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Souma smilesoft %}
Fufu. Perhaps we have a few things in common, more than expected.

Had I noticed sooner, we could have had some engaging topics to discuss.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kaoru v2 %}
True. We probably could’ve spent our days like normal high school kids, having fun badmouthing our teachers and parents.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Souma glare %}
There is not a single chance I’d ever badmouth my parents! I truly cannot get along with you after all…!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kaoru awkward %}
This kid’s real tricky…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Souma %}
Well, that is of no matter right now. This is simply in defense of my father rather than a continuation of the topic, but he was furious with me for a reason.

The missing remains belonged to a figure that, at the time, was worshiped as a living god for a religion.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kaoru northinking %}
Religion, huh… I did vaguely hear about how Kanata-kun’s family is something like that.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Souma %}
So you only vaguely know about it? Well, it is probably not an interesting story to get deeply involved with.

Regardless, since you are aware of that, I will cut the explanation short. To put it simply, it is not merely a story about how the remains disappeared.

It is about how <em>God</em> disappeared. The very foundation of our hearts.

It is only natural that it caused a huge uproar.

And to make matters worse… Shortly after that, further strange events began to occur—

“Written Statement of Repentance”

“I, Kanzaki Souma, failed to obey my parents’ instructions, and in my profli…”

P… Pr… Prof-li-ga-t…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Souma kidsmile %}
Ah, “profligate”. There it is. ♪

<th>(Mm, you can find anything in a dictionary.)</th>

<th>(I must use the correct verbiage, or my feelings will not be properly conveyed.)</th>

<th>(Perhaps it would be wise to carry a dictionary with me from now on.)</th>

<th>(A dictionary in my right hand, and the katana in my left.)</th>

<th>(Mhm, I would be unstoppable. ♪)</th>

<th>(Though, they are both too heavy for my stature, as I am still small…)</th>

<th>(And that katana — my family’s heirloom that I will one day inherit — is a heritage I can only gaze at from afar during Shinto rituals. It is forbidden to even touch it.)</th>
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Souma kidsmilesoft %}
<th>(However, I hope to someday become someone worthy of equipping such possessions.)</th>

<th>(A reputable samurai who rightly carries a sword on his waist.)</th>

<th>(And that is another reason why I must reflect on myself and train more right now.)</th>
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Souma kidnorthinking %}
Let’s see… “and in my profligate behavior, violated a taboo, and disgraced my family name.”

“Henceforth, I swear that I will reflect upon myself and amend my behavior, so that I never make the same error again.”

Mhm, it is complete. The content and brushwork are excellent — I am quite satisfied with this.

Now to deliver this to Fathe—

<th>(Mm? Is there a guest? Father is speaking to someone…?)</th>

<th>(I mustn’t disturb them, so I shall wait a bit. I do not want to be berated again.)</th>

…Oh, there is a cat in the garden.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Souma kidgrin %}
What a preciously adorable calico cat.[^7]

Now, now, you will not find fish here. You will need to go someplace else if you would like to hunt some.

You will get severely reprimanded if you trifle with a human’s belongings~ You naughty kitty.

<th>(Mm… I do not mean to eavesdrop, but Father’s voice is so loud that I can somewhat hear what they are discussing.)</th>
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Souma kidworried %}
<th>(…H-Hold on, my name was mentioned. How embarrassing…! Is he complaining about his inadequate son in front of the guest…?)</th>

<th>(Father~! I have properly reflected on myself! I will never repeat the same mistake again!)</th>

<th>(Please forgive me alrea— Mm?)</th>
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Souma kidcurious %}
<th>(“God”? Did you say “God,” Father?)</th>

<th>(—As I understand it, the strange child I encountered at the funeral venue that day is God.)</th>

<th>(That child certainly did have such an air, that the notion of it is explicable.)</th>
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Souma kidserious %}
<th>(And although my household is not to do with a shrine, but rather one of samurai, it seems that we have been involved in Shinto rituals for generations.)</th>

<th>(I have had the opportunity to observe many Shinto rituals myself, and I have gone through various kinds of training all for this very reason—)</th>

<th>(It is all to ensure that, when the time comes, I will hold the ritual dedicated to God safely.)</th>

<th>(Father has not stated any of this, but that appears to be the case.)</th>

<th>(And on that day, I unknowingly encountered an eminent being whom I will eventually serve.)</th>

<th>(An upper-class, superior being that is forbidden to speak to.)</th>
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Souma kidsigh %}
<th>(Therefore, it is only natural that I was reprimanded. Were this any generation earlier, even decapitation would be a lenient punishment — For I had done something unforgivable.)</th>

<th>(I have reflected on myself properly… I swear to never defile God’s eyes ever again.)</th>
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Souma kidsad4 %}
<th>(Ah, but that God was wearing a blindfold of some sort, so I was likely not visible to the eye…)</th>

<th>(Which feels a little lonely to think about…)</th>
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Souma kidnorsmile %}
<th>(God’s fingertips that touched my head that day were gentle, soft, and warm.)</th>

<th>(Even when I was not aware that that being was God — I felt something sacred towards that being.)</th>

<th>(Is that what God is meant to be?)</th>

<th>(If so, then is it not wonderful to serve and worship God?)</th>
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Souma kidcurious %}
…Mm?

<th>(Mm~? What has Father been talking about for the past while?)</th>

<th>(“Abisu”? What is “Abisu”?)[^8]</th>

<th>(Father and the guest keep saying that word.)</th>

<th>(There is an extraordinary air to their conversation… It is as if they are military commanders about to head to a great battle. How magnificent.)</th>

<th>(But what *is* “Abisu”? I have never heard of this word.)</th>
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Souma kidheh %}
<th>(Heh, however… In my hand is a dictionary!)</th>

<th>(I can search for any words I do not know immediately. It is crucial that I identify everything around me that I do not know, and grow to understand all of it.)</th>

<th>(A… Ab… Abisu. Abisu… Oh, there it is.)</th>

<th>(Its meaning is…?)</th>

<th>(Erm, it means “hell” in English.)</th>

<th>(It also means the “deep”— How do I read this kanji again? Umm, I believe I saw it in one of my books, and struggled with it even then, so I had to look it up on the dictionary as well…?)</th>

<th>(Ah, that’s right! “Abyss”! <em>Abisu</em> means the “deep abyss”!)</th>[^9]

<th>(The pitch-dark depths, extremely deep within the ocean.)</th>

bored\~ bored, bored\~ boooreeed\~

so bored, kanata could melt.

……what is mikejma doing.

god is bored, you know.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Madara kidnorsmile %}
—Did you call for this Mikejma here, O Holy God?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata kidsurprised %}
wah?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Madara kid %}
Just kidding. Heya, you suuure look bored, God.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata kidcurious %}
mikejima.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata kidnod %}
mikejimaa~…♪

—wah! unh?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Madara kidshocked %}
Are you alright!? You trip a lot, God… You a little kid?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata kidsigh %}
uu. kanata is still not used to this place… kanata does not know where everything is, so kanata tripped and fell.

it hurts… kanata hit one’s forehead. it is throbbing.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Madara kidfrown %}
If you’re God, then you need to bear with it.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata kidsad4 %}
mm… it is as mikejima says. kanata will bear with it.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata kidsobbing %}
<em><th>(sniff, sobs)</th></em>… but, it hurts… maybe bearing with it is, not possible…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Madara kidawkward %}
Ahh~ You’re bleeding… Don’t move, I’ll disinfect it.

I also get into fights a lot with my paren— I mean, the bad guys, and get injured. That’s why I always carry first aid with me so I can do basic treatment.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata kidcurious %}
injured? is mikejima alright?

kanata is the one who tripped, but mikejima seems to be in pain, too.

did mikejima’s father and mother scold mikejima again?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Madara kidfrown %}
Ahh~ Well, yeah, they’re still nagging me about what happened the other day.

Like, “why did you *ever* think it was a good idea to take the very being you’re supposed to protect outside?” and stuff.

My parents were also criticized a lot by other worshipers, apparently. So basically, they’re just whining ‘cause their reputation was damaged.

That’s basically what it means when you’re told to “never cause trouble for others.”
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata kidnorsmile %}
there, there.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Madara kidglare %}
…Were you even listening to me, God?

Don’t pat me. The disinfectant liquid on your hand is dripping down on me, and making my eyes sting.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata kidworried %}
sorry. but mikejima seemed to be suffering.

do not cry… mikejima did nothing wrong.

everything is kanata’s fault. because kanata wanted to meet mother.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Madara kidfrown %}
I’m not crying, and we didn’t even get to meet her in the end, which seeeriously sucks.

Nothing went right. The entire mission was a failure.

But… Why <em>did</em> the remains disappear, anyway…?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata kidcurious %}
kanata does not know. however, the chief priest[^11] — as in, father — said it was the abyss’s doing.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Madara kidcurious %}
I dunno or care if it’s Abyss or Ebisu[^12], but does it even <em>actually</em> exist in the first place?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata kidsigh %}
kanata does not know that, either… kanata is not god yet, so kanata does not know anything.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Madara kidfrown %}
Hmph… Whatever, anyway — You’re saying that I didn’t do anything wrong, but it <em>is</em> naturally my fault as well, y’know?

That’s why I got reprimanded. I broke a taboo, after all.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata kidserious %}
taboo… why is kanata not allowed to go outside?

is it because kanata could trip and get hurt? and therefore, everyone is worried for kanata?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Madara kidfrown %}
It’s probably ‘cause the air of mystique would fade away. God is distant, always hidden behind the bamboo blinds, or anything similar.

And ‘cause God can’t be seen, the delusions grow stronger, giving the impression that God is very sacred.

Those misconceptions by the worshipers are what keeps this religion alive, that’s all.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Madara kidnorsmile %}
That’s why you, who will eventually become God, are hidden from the world. ‘Cause if anyone were to meet you in person, they'd find out that you’re  a dumb and stupid kid, just like me.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata kidcurious %}
dumb? stupid? what do these words mean?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Madara kidgrin %}
It means pretty and cute!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata kidnod %}
ah, kanata understands… good, then. ehehe~♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Madara kidawkward %}
Mm~ God really is dumb… So dumb that it’s amusing.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata kidehen %}
praise kanata more. worship kanata more\~ ehe, ehe\~♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Madara kid %}
Haha. …Aaalright, I’m done treating ya. But as always, your hair is sooo long that it was hard to do. It’s a real hindrance~
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata kidworried %}
mm. kanata also thinks it is a hindrance.

when sleeping, kanata sometimes accidentally eats the strands, and it becomes difficult to breathe. it is a problem. kanata will die if kanata cannot breathe.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Madara kid %}
I’ll cut your hair in secret eventually.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata kidworried %}
it is not allowed. one must not cut one’s hair. nor take off this blindfold.

it is forbidden. if the taboo is broken, mikejima will be scolded again.

kanata does not want mikejima to be scolded… to be hurt or sad.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Madara kidsmilesoft %}
I see… Thank you.

But I really just can’t leave you as you are right now, y’know~?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata kidnorsmile %}
kanata is satisfied. it is boring, but mikejima makes it go away.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata kidsad4 %}
but. that is exactly why kanata was so scared that kanata might not see mikejima ever again.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Madara kid %}
You’re such a spoiled kid, God~ Do you feel lonely without me?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata kidserious %}
that should be obvious.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Madara kidnorsmile %}
I see. …Buuut the thing is, it’s actually forbidden to meet with God. I sneaked out of my cram classes again to come here.

I already understand every single thing from elementary school, so it’s boooring. That’s why I came over to play.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata kidworried %}
w-will you be alright? mikejima broke a taboo again? you will be scolded…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Madara kidgrin %}
I’ll be fine as long as they don’t find out~ Hahaha!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata kidworried %}
when kanata becomes god, kanata will change many regulations. kanata will make sure no scolding happens, even when mikejima and kanata are getting along together.

so wait a bit. it will be okay.

you probably only need to be patient for a little longer.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Madara kidsmilesoft2 %}
I see. Then I’ll wait without expecting too much.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata kidnorsmile %}
mm. keep that expectation.

it will all be okay. because god does not lie.
{% endbubble %}

## Chapter 7

{% bubble Kanata kidnod %}
<em><th>(munch, munch munch, munch munch)</th></em>…♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Madara kidsmilesoft %}
There, there, is it tasty? They juuust launched these snacks.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata kidnod %}
it is tasty. the things mikejima always brings are tasty, so kanata likes them.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Madara kid %}
Snacks, yeah?

Well, that makes sense — you’re not usually given any proper food, ‘cause you say you gotta do that shojin kessai…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Madara kidsmug %}
Ah— I know what “shojin kessai” means now, ‘cause I thoroughly looked it up!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata kidnorsmile %}
mm. kanata will become god. so shojin kessai is necessary.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Madara kid %}
When you become God, you might not be allowed to eat snacks anymore, y’knoow?

In fact, if I never snuck any snacks over here for you, I feel like God would’ve neeever gotten in contact with any snacks or entertainment.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata kidworried %}
mm… but, well, that is unavoidable. that is what it means to be god.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Madara kidyare %}
You’re completely brainwashed…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata kidsigh %}
…ah, kanata finished eating it already.

there are no more tasty things. sadly…

mikejima. even when kanata becomes god, will mikejima still bring snacks in secret again?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Madara kidnorthinking %}
Mm~ I might not be able to promise that, y’knoow? Once you become God, you’ll probably have way more security and surveillance here, so it may be a lot harder to get close to God, yeaah?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata kidnorsmile %}
it will be okay. because mikejima can do anything.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Madara kidawkward %}
I can’t do everything, though~? I’m not God, after all.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata kidsmilesoft %}
even if you cannot do everything, mikejima can do so many things that kanata likes.

mikejima~ do that again. the one mikejima likes.

the one called ‘ally of justice’. the interesting one of singing and dancing.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Madara kidfrown %}
Now that he’s satisfied himself with snacks, the next thing on the list is a show, huh… What a big shot~ He’s deeefinitely a God in that regard.

Also, you really like seeing me act like an ally of justice, dont’chaaa, God?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata kidnod %}
mm. it is fun, so kanata likes it.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Madara kidserious %}
But God, you don’t seem to really understand what an ally of justice is about, do you?

Allies of justice and idols are different — They’re not typically the type to sing and dance, y’knoow?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata kidnorsmile %}
but, they say interesting things, and do interesting moves.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Madara kidfrown %}
Well, it’s true that tokusatsu allies of justice also possess the characteristics of performing those sorts of shows.

After all, part of its business is to present something in a fascinating way to attract merchandise sales.

But the ally of justice I yearn to become aren’t existences meant to be for entertainment… They’re allies of justice who fight against evil — who crush the strong and save the weak.

<th>(……Unlike my father, who only colludes with evil while he puts on a mask of justice.)</th>
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata kidsmileconfident %}
then, that is the same as kanata.

after all, kanata’s duty is to defeat the evil things[^13], as well.

kanata is also what you call an ally of justice.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Madara kidheh %}
Heh! <em>You</em>, an ally of justice? When all you ever do is trip and cry?

When you can’t even walk unless I hold your hand? You, who’d probably immediately die if I wasn’t there to protect you?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata kidcurious %}
is it not okay? mikejima will also become an ally of justice someday, right?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata kidnod %}
if kanata were to also become ‘that’, then kanata and mikejima would aaalways be… together~♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Madara kidserious %}
………

…You’re gonna become God, aren’t you? Sooo isn’t it impossible for you to become an ally of justice in the future?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata kidsigh %}
ah, right. this is a problem. kanata cannot become both god and ally of justice… if only kanata could split into two.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Madara kid %}
Maybe we could pluck off your legs. A body miiight grow from them! ♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata kidworried %}
d-do not say something so terrifying. mikejima is mean sometimes.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Madara kidsmilesoft %}
You make it sound like I’m typically kiiind~
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata kidnod %}
mikejima <em>is</em> kind. mikejima is number one in kanata’s world.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Madara kidyare %}
<em>Me</em>, number one? The world God lives in has suuuch a tiny population, huh…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata kidsad4 %}
mm. there are not many people in kanata’s world. kanata is rarely able to meet family, and the worshipers are always far away.

that is why kanata is always lonely.

hey, mikejima… do not go anywhere.

stay by kanata’s side forever.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Madara kidgrin %}
Sure, sure~ If that’s God’s order, then I’ll gladly abide by it~♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata kidglare %}

## Translation Notes

[^1]: Young Souma speaks about the same as present Souma, in old-fashioned Japanese (*de-aru*). Unlike present Souma, sometimes he speaks a bit more child-like, such as using words like *kana* (maybe), instead of a more formal/old-fashioned way.
[^2]: Young Kanata speaks differently from the present. While he does speak in hiragana only, there are no quotation marks around any of his words, possibly due to how short his sentences are. He also refers to himself in third-person (*kanata* instead of his first-person pronoun in the present time, *boku*). Last but not least, he speaks in old-fashioned Japanese, as well as using an imperative, commanding tone, akin to a high-being ordering those below him. Present Kanata, in comparison, speaks in polite speech, including his requests (always saying *kudasai* when asking someone to do something).
[^3]: Young Madara speaks basically the same as present Madara, with his elongated vowels at the end of the sentence. Sometimes he speaks a bit more child-like than present Madara would.
[^4]: TBA
[^5]: This “Kanata-san” may or may not be a mistake, as young Madara has only been calling Kanata by “God” up until now (and “Kanata-kun” only in his head). For now I'll stick to the original script as is.
[^6]: This is said when something happening is so rare, that it might be a sign of an unlikely rain.
