<th>(Hmm… Guess it’s a no-go after all. Anzu-san isn’t picking up the phone.)</th>

<th>(That must mean she’s probably busy taking care of that well-known unit of hers, huh?)</th>

<th>(And here I was thinking she might have a job for me. I wonder what she’s up to right now?)</th>
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Yuta srsthinking %}
<th>(Well, since this is Anzu-san we’re talking about, maybe she’ll call me back once she notices the missed call…)</th>

<th>(Man, I’m just going around in circles at this point… I’ve been dropping by the stores whose flyers had caught my eye to ask if they had work for me, but…)</th>

<th>(It’s been one rejection after another so far.)</th>

<th>(I figured since our names are relatively well-known in the downtown area, I’d be in demand…)</th>

<th>(But I guess I really can’t do things on my own… It has to be 2wink.)</th>

<th>(Is this the extent of the strength I have as an individual…? Although, I guess 2wink isn’t all that famous, either.)</th>

<th>(If a shop’s looking for work, they’d rather work with a unit that is both popular <em>and</em> prestigious.)</th>

<th>(Even though I’m looking for a job in order to <em>gain</em> that popularity and prestige.)</th>
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Yuta sighfrown %}
<th>(Ugh… Nothing’s going well at all. How does Aniki typically find work?)</th>

<th>(To think I’d always be blaming Aniki when telling him to “find us some work already”, too…)</th>

<th>(I hadn’t realized how hard it was to actually <em>get</em> that work. I didn’t know a single thing.)</th>
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Yuta sad %}
<th>(…………)</th>
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shinobu grin %}
Nihihi. Yuuta-kun, you’re amazing~♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Yuta shocked %}
Huh, what? Sorry, I spaced out for a bit there! I didn’t hear a thing you said!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shinobu nod %}
Ah, I was simply thinking about how incredible it is that you can call someone on the phone without any hesitation.

Personally for me, when I decide to call someone, I need about three days to mentally prepare myself for it!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Yuta norsmile %}
Ahh… Is that why you barely call me even though I gave you my number, Shinobu-kun?

You’re welcome to call me like whenever, just to kill some time or something, y’know?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shinobu frown %}
Ahh, no, it is just—It’s quite difficult to let go of habits so deeply ingrained within me…

I’m terrible with phone calls. I just cannot help but feel anxious when we cannot see each other’s face while speaking.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Yuta norsmile %}
You say “see each other’s face”, but you’re always hiding yours under your bangs!

Now I’m all curious about what’s going on with that eye of yours! Can I take a look?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shinobu surprised0 %}
Eep—Spare me! Gosh, that’s very insensitive of you, you know…!?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Yuta surprised %}
I’m being intensitive!? I-I’m sorry?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shinobu angry %}
Uuu, you don’t have to apologize, Yuuta-kun. I am simply still too embarrassed to lay my entire face bare.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shinobu smile %}
You, on the other hand, are always so bold and confident; I really admire that~♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Yuta nod2 %}
<th>(Ahaha, it makes me happy how Shinobu-kun’s so impressed even by the most trivial things… This kind of thing is new to me, it’s like having a little brother.)</th>
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shinobu norsmile %}
In any case, I’m sure Anzu-dono’s busy, too. It’s almost time for StarFes, and then there’s the massive event “SS” that’s happening at the end of the year.[^1]

It isn’t only her—Isara-dono seems busier than usual these days, as well.

He’s an important member in the Student Council, after all. Not to mention that he’s also going to perform in SS as a member of Trickstar, the unit that will represent our school.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shinobu northinking %}
He truly is an incredible person…

To be honest, it is truly a mystery why he’s always made time for someone like <em>me</em>… Uuu, my body and soul shiver from the cold…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Yuta %}
Keep your spirits up, Shinobu-kun. I’m sorry, I feel like I’m making you walk around for no reason at all… I can’t find any work at all, so how about we call it and go home for the day?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shinobu v2 %}
If that’s what you prefer, Yuuta-kun, then it’s alright with me. I’m simply here to accompany you, so~?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Yuta %}
Oh, right. Do you wanna get dinner somewhere, then? I’ll treat ya to somethin’ for helping me look for work, okay~, how ‘bout it?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shinobu srsthinking %}
Mm, is this not an odd time for dinner?

I prefer having a small snack instead~ For you see, I am a ninja who manages fine without much food.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Yuta %}
So you’re a small eater, huh, Shinobu-kun? Won’t that stunt your height?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shinobu sigh %}
Uu~… But, but, a small stature comes in great use for infiltration missions, no?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Yuta smileconfident %}
Ah! They’re selling takoyaki over there! Let’s get that! Since I’m a big eater and you’re a small eater, we can probably split it just right! ♪[^2]
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shinobu worried %}
Ooh. Yuuta-kun, you sometimes drop conversation topics out of nowhere, don’t you…?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Yuta %}
Huh, do I? Hmm… I don’t usually have to say anything in particular for Aniki to understand me… So I guess I skip verbalizing at times?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shinobu v2 %}
Hwaah~, the two of you have such a wondrous connection as twins… I’m a little bit jealous. I’m an only child, you see.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Yuta sighfrown %}
Hm… It’s just that we’ve always been together growing up, so we just kinda understand one another.

It’s not like some supernatural telepathy or anything, you know? Sooner or later, we won’t know what the other’s thinking anymore.

Even now, I’m not sure if he knows what I’m thinking~.

It gets me really irritated all the time. It’s because we’re so similar that even the slightest differences bother me, you know?
{% endbubble %}

## Chapter 2

{% bubble Shinobu surprised %}
Hweeh!?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Yuta surprised %}
W-What is it? Don’t make weird noises out of nowhere, that scared me…!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shinobu v2 %}
Ahh, Yuuta-kun… Which means, the one I see across the street must be Hinata-kun, correct?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shinobu scold %}
My soul nearly left my body there, you know~! You were talking to me just a moment ago, and then it was as if you suddenly teleported all the way over there! I-I thought it was ninjutsu for a second…!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Yuta shocked %}
Huh? What do you mean by that… Wait, you’re right, that <em>is</em> Aniki over there, across the street!
{% endbubble %}

{% img /img/es/eventstory/christmaslive/line2-1.jpg %}

{% bubble Hinata grin %}
~……♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Yuta angry %}
W-What are you doing, Aniki? And what’s with that outfit? Is it Santa-san…? But it’s got horns, so a reindeer…?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Yuta hmphleft %}
<em>God</em>, now I’m angry! He’s doing some nonsense without telling me again!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shinobu awkward %}
<th>(I don’t feel as though Yuuta-kun’s any different, though… He was also doing something without telling his brother…)</th>

<th>(But I think he’ll get angry if I say that; I shall keep my mouth zipped here. I’m the kind of kid who can read the room.)</th>
{% endbubble %}

{% img /img/es/eventstory/christmaslive/line2-2.jpg %}

{% bubble Tetora fist %}
~……♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shinobu curious %}
<th>(Oh—I see Tetora-kun next to Hinata-kun!)</th>

<th>(Tetora-kun is, on the other hand, simply wearing the academy’s idol uniform~ But it looks a little too cold to wear by itself in this season, does it not…?)</th>
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shinobu sad2 %}
<th>(Uuu, it feels weird to be seen happily hanging out with a friend from class by a friend from my unit…)</th>

<th>(I don’t have a single clue how I’m supposed to act here… Ahh, I’m aware there’s more important things to worry about here, however!)</th>
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Yuta angry %}
<em>Aniki</em>…!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shinobu surprised %}
Uhyah—!? Yuuta-kun, you’ll get hurt if you run here! Some parts of the road are frozen over with ice! Wait a mome—W-Woah!?

<th>(Ooh… Yuuta-kun’s slipping through the crowd so smoothly! He must have really trained himself, whether in agility or something else…)</th>

<th>(I cannot allow myself to fall behind and lose! Nin-nin…♪)</th>
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora %}
Woah—? Someone’s rushing over toward us, Hinata-kun.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Hinata grin %}
Huh, what’s going on? Are we gettin’ robbed? Beat ‘em up, Tetsu-kun! ♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora %}
Nah, I can’t beat that guy up… It’s your li’l brother, y’know?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Hinata surprised %}
Ack, you’re right!

Y-Yuuta-ku~n? What a coincidence, meeting you here, huh? ☆
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Yuta scold %}
Don’t “what a coincidence ☆” me, Aniki! What is this? Why didn’t you tell me you’re working with, uhh… that guy from Ryuseitai?

Are you hoping to leave 2wink for Ryuseitai, or something?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Yuta hmphleft %}
Well, fine, not like I’ll stop you! I bet you got so sick of me always nagging at you, huh!?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Hinata awkward %}
No, that’s not… Aren’t you misunderstanding, Yuuta-ku~n?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Yuta glare %}
Then quit doing things that can be misunderstood every single <em>time</em>! If you’re gonna do something, then talk to me about it. We’re the two-in-one 2wink, aren’t we~!?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Hinata yare %}
No, umm? You’re wrong, this doesn’t count as cheating! I’m serious!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora %}
Calm down a li’l, ermm, the Yuuta-kun twi—Yuuta-kun.

You can’t just yell at someone without hearing ‘em out first. You gotta listen to what your big bro has to say too, ‘kay~?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Yuta glare %}
You’re just an outsider, so don’t stick your nose into this! This is a 2wink matter, a <em>family</em> matter!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shinobu cryalmost %}
*Huff, huff*…! I finally caught up… What’s the situation right now?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora grin %}
Ah, Sengoku-kun. ‘Suuup~ It’s not every day we meet around town, huh~♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shinobu srsthinking %}
O-Owh… It is because I can’t handle crowds… T-Tetora-kun, wh-what’re you doin’… doing here?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora curious %}
How come you’re stammering like that?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora grin2 %}
I bet it’s ‘cuz it’s too cold to talk properly, isn’t it\~? Ahaha\~ Lemme go getcha some hot coffee. ♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shinobu surprised %}
Ah, no! Leave that aside for now—Yuuta-kun’s strangling Hinata-kun, please stop him! I won’t be able to hold him back with my strength, so…!?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora angry %}
Oh, woah—Heeey~ You’re getting in the way of business by causing a ruckus in front of the store, y’know?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Yuta angry %}
Shut it! Aniki, you better have a good explanation!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Hinata worried %}
Nggh… W-Well, you see… It’s just a small part-time job! I didn’t have enough cash for the ingredients for the Christmas cake, you see!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Hinata smile %}
And you know~, I’m gonna make somethin’ <em>really</em> gorgeous this year! ☆
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora curious %}
Huh? But Hinata-kun, didn’t you say something ‘bout 2wink’s unit finan—Mmphh!?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Hinata angry %}
D-Don’t say anything! Please, Tetsu-kun!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Yuta hmphleft %}
Now *what* are you whispering to each other about? Well, whatever, like I care! What’s it matter what you do with the money you earn, Aniki! It’s Aniki’s business, isn’t it~?

And <em>I</em> get to have my own business, too! Let’s go, Shinobu-kun!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shinobu shocked %}
Huh? Huh? H-Hold on—… Go where? Awawa—?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora glare %}
Hey, hold it right there! Please don’t be so rough with my comrade! He’ll trip and get hurt if you keep pulling him so forcefully!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shinobu surprised0 %}
Owowowow, you’re being rough too, Tetora-kun! Don’t grab my arm so tightly, you’ll leave a bruise—Wait, my arms are going to come off at this rate…!?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora frown %}
Ugh~! This is gettin’ so chaotic, I dunno what’s even goin’ on anymore! Everyone, take a deep breath!

Or else I’ll make you zip it with my fists!

It’s almost Christmas, so don’t go doing somethin’ as stupid as getting all tense at this point in the year! If you don’t start bein’ good kids, Santa-san won’t come visit you!
{% endbubble %}

## Chapter 3

<div class="msr-location">
    <p><span><b>Location:</b> Park’s Live Stage</span></p>
</div>

{% img /img/es/eventstory/christmaslive/line3.jpg %}

{% bubble Hinata sad %}
…………
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Yuta hmphleft %}
…………
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki fist %}
Ah~ Ahem! I’d like someone to explain to me what’s going on, so that I can understand!

So, ermm, what’s the situation? Those two are from 2wink, right?

They always looked to be getting along, so why would they be fighting now? Nagumo, Sengoku, please explain it to me!

When I tried contacting you guys, you were gasping for breath asking for help, so I rushed over as fast as I could…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki frown %}
But I can’t really intervene if I don’t know what’s going on, y’know?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki grin2 %}
I feel a little proud of you all for relying on me, though! You can all rest easy now that the burning heart Morisawa Chiaki is here! ☆
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora yare %}
Please keep quiet, Taichou. Anzu-Anego is sorting out the situation by asking everyone for their part of the story right now.

Please don’t get in her way by causing a ruckus.

The one we called for help was Anzu-Anego when it comes down to it… You’re somethin’ like an extra here, so I’d like it if you stepped back a bit.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki cryalmost %}
M-Mm. Nagumo’s attitude towards me just gets drier and drier, huh…

In that case, I leave this all to you, Anzu. We’ve got our own side of things to prepare, mainly for the Eve’s Eve Live.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shinobu v2 %}
Taichou-dono~ What exactly is this “Eve’s Eve Live”? The name has an oddly nice ring to it~…?[^3]
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki grin2 %}
Mm. It’s a job; we’ll be performing a live show on a stage set up in this park.

It seems that some of our unitmates are likely to behave irresponsibly when left to their own devices, so… I asked Anzu if there’s any suitable work we could take on.

Anzu actually appears to be on break, too… But she still went around all over the place and searched for a job suitable for Ryuseitai.

That’s when she found this one. They were just about to consider canceling the live show because another unit, who’d been scheduled to perform in the live, announced that they would not be able to participate, after all…

It turns out, that unit has a member who caught a cold.[^4]

So we’re acting as their substitutes. You guys should maintain good care of your health too, alright?

Anyway, that job is known as the “Eve’s Eve Live”.

It’s apparently a live show intended to celebrate the upcoming StarFes, as well as advertise for it.[^1]

The goal is to attract an audience and promote StarFes.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shinobu northinking %}
Hmm~ So it’s like an opening act for StarFes? By the way, are we Ryuseitai not participating in StarFes itself?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki v2 %}
Ah, no, all units are meant to perform there. So of course, that means we’ll also participate.

But the main performers will be a different unit, and for the most part, we plan to put on our usual performance there.

That being said, the Eve’s Eve Live will act as a good rehearsal for that, won’t it?

Our schedule was getting jam-packed with things to do as of late, though…

So if it were possible, I wanted to give you all a proper break, but… Well, I’m sure it’ll be alright. We’re all still young, after all! ♪

But today was actually meant to be a day off from Ryuseitai activities, specifically… so you don’t have to force yourselves to join the live show, okay?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori sigh %}
Ahh, then I’d like to skip out on this… It’s cold anyway, I wanna go home and sleep…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora grin %}
C’mon, don’t say that! You’ll join us too, Midori-kun. The five of us together are Ryuseitai! We’ve even got just the right outfits for this, too~♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki v2 %}
Ooh, what’re those costumes? Eve’s Eve Live was a sudden job, so I didn’t really have the time to prepare everything.

I was actually planning to perform with our usual Ryuseitai uniforms, but this might change things…?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora niyaclosed %}
Heh-heh. Y’see, Taisho made some outfits for Hinata-kun. Except, he made waaay too many after getting a li’l too into it, apparently…

Do you think we could use these outfits for the performance?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki grin2 %}
Hm, they’re Santa outfits, perfect for the occasion! If we ask Anzu to tailor it to our sizes, it should be usable! Wonderful work, Nagumo! ♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora fist %}
It’s actually all thanks to Taisho. I didn’t really do anything. There’s a variety of colors and sizes here, so I think there should be an outfit that each of us can wear~?
{% endbubble %}

## Chapter 4

{% bubble Tetora smileconfident %}
Here you go, Midori-kun; the green-colored outfit’s for you…♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori frownshake %}
Uuu, so I’m also gonna participate in the end…? I’m not a fan of the green-colored Santa-san costume, since it kinda makes him seem like he’s an impostor…?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata v2 %}
how [colorful]~ it looks like a [coral reef]. mine will be~ blue…♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori curious %}
Ah—Shinkai-senpai, you were sleeping this whole time, but you’re awake now, huh…?

Are you doing alright, health-wise…? If you’re not feeling it, how about we go home together…?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata v2 %}
ufufu. i do not want to be the only one [left out]~ let’s work hard at this job… okay, midori? ♪

the five of us together are Ryuseitai, you know…♪

chiaki~ chiaki will be [red] as always, right? here you go~…♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki srsthinking %}
…………
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata norsmile %}
what is wrong, chiaki? you do not seem energetic…?

did you catch my [cold]…?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki angry %}
Ah, no… Nagumo, would you like to wear the outfit for Red this time?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora surprised %}
Huh? Where’d this come from…? I’m Ryusei <em>Black</em>, aren’t I?

There’s a black Santa outfit here, so I’ll be wearing this one, yeah~?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki angry %}
No, it’s just that I thought it’d be a good opportunity for you. After all, you seem to admire Kiryu—…admire Akatsuki. Plus, you’d much prefer the color red over black, right?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki sad %}
And yet, you’ve constantly had a color that barely satisfies your wishes pushed onto you. I’m sorry, I also had my reasons why I couldn’t just give up Red, but…

I’ve had you bear with it all this time, and I apologize for that.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora frown2 %}
Mm~… Well, yeah, I couldn’t stand a single bit of it at first. Every time I put on the black outfit, I felt so pathetic and frustrated with myself.

But the black spots on the sun are where the temperature is lower. And <em>that</em>’s what I am.

I’m still inexperienced, and I was lacking in lots of different areas. That’s why I couldn’t get into Akatsuki—That’s all there is to it.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora norsmile %}
So that one day I can burst into red flames… I’m currently getting a share of everyone’s coal and heat.

I’m still a greenhorn who can’t yet reach Taichou’s level, let alone Taisho’s.

And when the day comes that I wear the red outfit… I don’t want it to be just ‘cuz “the opportunity for it has come”; I wanna wear it once I personally feel satisfied and ready for it.

So, is it alright if we put this talk off ‘til next year?

I’ll be sure to grow strong by the day you graduate and leave, Taichou.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora fist %}
As for Santa-san, he always comes dressed in the color red.

And Red, the leading actor… is definitely you, Taichou. I appreciate how you feel, but I’m just not capable enough yet.

Right now, Ryusei Black suits me just right. I’ll gladly wear this outfit.

So you don’t have to be considerate over stuff that nobody asked for, y’know~? It doesn’t suit you at all to be like that, anyway.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki grin %}
Ah, I see… You’ve really grown, Nagumo. May I hug you?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora sigh %}
No, I don’t want it. What’s with you today? You’re kinda acting gross. You sure you didn’t catch a cold?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki smilesoft2 %}
Ah, no, sorry… Thank you, Nagumo—For growing up to be so big and strong.[^5]
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki fist %}
Aaalrighty then, I’ll wear the red outfit with much gratitude!

I’ll sing with all my might today, as Santa-san! For the sake of bringing dreams to all the kids out there! Fuhahaha…! ☆

## Translation Notes

[^1]: StarFes is a Yumenosaki Academy DreamFes that happens on Christmas, while SS is a huge-scaled event that happens at the end of the year, with units representing their respective school/agency participating. Trickstar acts as the Yumenosaki Academy’s representative in SS.
[^2]: Takoyaki (lit. fried octopus) are ball-shaped and cooked in molded pans, and typically are filled with minced octopus and other ingredients. They’re typically served in plates of 4-8, so they’re very splittable.
[^3]: In Japanese, the name is <em>ibu-ibu-raibu</em>, each word ending with <em>bu</em>, hence Shinobu’s comment on it.
[^4]: This is referring to Valkyrie. You can learn more about this in Star Festival, Holy Knights 2 and 3. Please check <a href="https://enstarsmasterlist.github.io/scoutevent" target="_blank">this masterlist</a> for a translation.
[^5]: Chiaki says something similar to Tetora a year later, in <a href="/motor_show/epilogue/" target="_blank">Motor Show, Epilogue 3</a>.
[^6]: He’s singing the lyrics from <em>kiyoshi kono yoru</em>, also known as Silent Night.
