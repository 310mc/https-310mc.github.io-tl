{% bubble Tetora fist %}
Alright, everyone! There’s not much time left ‘til the Eve’s Eve Live is over!

While we’d love to keep the enthusiasm up with more and more hype—Christmas Eve and the actual performance have yet to happen, so~

Let’s not overdo it and end things early so that nobody catches a cold!

But to anyone hoping for way more—don’t worry! We’d love to have you join us over at Yumenosaki Academy’s StarFes, on Christmas day!

As a present, we’ll bring even more passionate, glittering bright dreams to everyone there…☆
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki grin2 %}
Mhm! Wonderful MC! It’s so full of excitement, Nagumo!

You’re informing them about everything that needs to be conveyed as concisely as possible! There’s really nothing else I could teach you at this point, huh…☆

I’m so moved! I can feel my eyes begin to water! My tears are so passionately hot, not even the winter’s cold can freeze them! Fuhahahaha! ☆
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora frown2 %}
Taichou, you’ve been performin’ this whole time, so how come you’re still so energetic? Gonna be real with ya—It’s just getting in my way. I’d rather you not snatch the spotlight from your junior.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora smile %}
C’mon 2wink, you rush over here too! If you take too long, Taichou’s gonna snatch away all the good bits~

This guy always does that!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki sigh %}
Nagumo, why do you always say things that pierce deep in my heart… What can’t you stand about me!? Do you hate me!?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Yuta awkward %}
Ahaha, you just can’t help but have mixed feelings when someone more talented raves about you with such high praise, you know.

When the sun shines bright enough, the stars around it become overshadowed and invisible to the eye.

And then that sun comes around and tells you something like, “you can shine brighter than that!”…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Yuta norsmile %}
It’s hard not to feel angry, or rather, pathetic. You understand, don’t you, Tetora-kun?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora %}
Ooh, Yuuta-kun! The outfit suits you perfectly~♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Yuta yare %}
That’s ‘cause it was tailored to fit Aniki exactly. So it fits me perfectly as well. At least for now, as frustrating as that is.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Hinata grin %}
Well *I’m* happy that we can still wear the same outfits… We’ll get to make even more memories this year as just the two of us, right? ♪
{% endbubble %}

{% img /img/es/eventstory/christmaslive/yutabcg.jpg %}

{% bubble Yuta smileconfident %}
It’s no longer just you and I, Aniki. Come on, things aren’t the same as “back then” when we were on the streets, shivering in the cold. We’re surrounded by the many, many stars of Ryuseitai.

This year will probably be a much “warmer” Christmas than ever before.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Hinata niyaclosed %}
Though, with so <em>many</em> stars, it’ll be way harder to stand out! But if we huddle close and stand together, we can shine brighter than any sun!

Behold the brilliance of 2wink, the twin stars! Make sure to burn it into your eyes, everyone~! ☆
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Yuta %}
2wink, the two-in-one twin idols, are pleased to meet you! ☆
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora smilesoft2 %}
(…Whew, what a relief. They’re still a li’l awkward around each other, but… looks like they made up, huh?)

(Guess it was a good thing that I really ripped into them—Or well, more specifically, swinging my fist at ‘em.)

(I might’ve done somethin’ unwarranted for their sake, but… That’s how an ally of justice rolls, right… Probably, I dunno~♪)

We shouldn’t get in their way, huh? C’mon Taichou, how about we go and hand out presents to the kids~?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki grin2 %}
Yeah! ☆ You can count on me for that, it’s my field of expertise! C’mon kiddos, gather around~! Santa-san’s got gifts for you! Come and get them!

Theeere, there, there~♪ *(pat, pat, pat)* You kids must be so sleepy by now, so we’re grateful that you stuck around with us for this long!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki surprised0 %}
Ah—Hey, hold it, Kanata! Don’t give out live animals—! Where did you get those sea creatures from!?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata curious %}
ehh\~… [winter] is the season for [seafood], you know\~?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata v2 %}
here you go, a [sea cucumber] for you\~♪ and for you, a [sea anemone]\~…☆
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki scold %}
Stop right there, you’ll traumatize the kids! Nagumo, hold Kanata down at once! Sengoku, come with me! We’ll split the work between us to distribute the rest of the presents, alright?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shinobu v2 %}
Roger that~! However, Taichou-dono… The Eve’s Eve Live can be viewed for free, so there is barely any profit to this…

If we were to distribute presents as well, wouldn’t we make a net loss here?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki v2 %}
Mm? Oh yeah, true! But, well, the kids’ smiles are our reward! In that regard, Santa-san is the same as a hero! ♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Yuzuru %}
Hmm… You could simply make up for your loss at StarFes instead. By working at a deficit to put on a great display of hospitality as a way to entice people to attend, you can increase the profit production margin at the actual event.

It may appear as if you don’t think about these things in advance, I see that your methods <em>do</em> make quite a bit of sense. I’m impressed. Although, well, I suppose rather than calculated, it actually came naturally, perhaps?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki surprised %}
Woah—!? You scared me…! Ermm, you’re Fushimi from <em>fine</em>, right? I-I’ll have you know, this live show has been formally authorized…!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Yuzuru snicker %}
Fufu, even if it <em>were</em> unauthorized, I do not have the authority to intervene  as I am not a member of the student council.

That being said, even President-sama has given out silent approval for unauthorized matches.

More importantly, I had been told that Anzu-san would be here… Where could she be?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki northinking %}
Mm? You’re looking for Anzu?

She’s been busying herself with all sorts of things—from making preparations for the Eve’s Eve Live to tailoring our outfits, even setting up a merchandise booth and working as a vendor, so…?

I assume she’s decorating the Christmas tree at the moment.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Yuzuru sighfrown %}
Is that so? Goodness gracious, even though I had asked her to head into town hoping she would take a break for once…

I see she’s back hard at work before I even knew it.

If you turn your hobbies into a job, then you won’t have any refuge… However, well, it’s Anzu-san’s life; she can do as she pleases, I suppose.
