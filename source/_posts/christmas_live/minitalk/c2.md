I feel like lately, Nagumo's attitude towards me is just getting drier...

Compared to me, Anzu's pretty adored by Nagumo, huh...

A lot happened, but the sleepover party was extremely valuable!

For me, it was most especially a great opportunity to be aware of just how blessed I am to be surrounded by so many kind people!
