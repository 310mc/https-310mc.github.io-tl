By the way, Anzu, it's pretty late in the night… Are you sure it's alright to stay here?

I think Nagumo did mention something…?

              There's a chance some could toss and turn in their sleep, so I think the futon next to me is the most secure!

              You're dozing off… That's only natural; you've been working all day long after all.

              If you can't bear with the sleepiness any longer, you're free to sleep here for a little. I'll wake you up once your parents are here…☆
