{% bubble Chiaki grin2 %}
To everyone passing by! Merry Christmas! ☆

It’s almost time for the opening celebration of the StarFes performed by Yumenosaki Academy’s idols! Our performance, known as the “Eve’s Eve Live”, is about to begin!

Our performance is completely free to watch, so stop by whenever you like, no matter who you may be! We welcome you with open arms! ☆

We’re handing out warm drinks and other refreshments, too! Even gear to keep you warm from the cold! If you have any questions, please feel free to ask the Santa-sans at the venue!

By the way, I’m Morisawa Chiaki, from Ryuseitai! I’m the red-colored Santa-san… The typical Red Santa-san!

I’ll give a present full of warmth to everyone shivering from the cold, by singing with my burning hot red voice! Fuhahahahaha…! ☆

Come on, Sengoku! You introduce yourself too! You can use mine as an example to work off of!

You’re always hiding yourself behind our backs, but you should put more effort into standing out in the crowd, as well!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shinobu surprised %}
Wha—Eeep! No—You lose if you stand out as a ninja, like, erm…!?

It’s the same with Santa-san! If he’s caught by an occupant in their home while delivering presents, he’ll be mistaken for a robber, so…!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki fist %}
Don’t run away! You’ve got this! Recall all your experience up until now! Haven’t you grown stronger since then!?

If anyone can do it, it’s <em>you</em>, Sengoku! I believe in you! ☆
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shinobu srsthinking %}
U-Uuu\~…? I-I am Sengoku Shinobu! I’m the yellow-colored Santa-san—Known as Yellow Santa-san\~! Ermm, ermm…?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki grin2 %}
That’s perfect as is! Well fought! You’re such a good kid, Sengoku! Theeere, there, there~♪ *(pat, pat, pat)*

Yellow Santa will spread brilliance just like the illumination that paints the streets during the holy night! You can rest assured that each of you will get a whooole lot of sparkly radiance as a present from him! ☆

We appreciate your cheers! Thank you for the applause…☆
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata v2 %}
ufufu. the [illuminations] are so [pretty], aren’t they~♪

it is like the [very bottom] of the [sea]~ the [deep-sea fish] are twinkling\~♪ the [marine snow] is so fluffy\~♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki glare %}
Mm? It’s starting to snow! This isn’t good!

While it’s wonderful to have a white Christmas… There’s no roof over this stage, so we could slip if enough snow piles up.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori frownshake %}
Mm~ Judging by how the clouds are moving… We’ll be done with our live show by the time it starts to snow that heavily, I think…?

I’m way more worried about our guests; they look like they could catch a cold anytime now… Can’t we cancel the performance, or at least end it early…?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki v2 %}
You’ve really got no enthusiasm, Takamine! Show some energy! You’ll feel warmer if you sing and dance as much as possible!

Ignite your engine! Our Christmas has only just begun!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori sigh %}
Christmas hasn’t even started, though… You’re always, <em>always</em> in a rush with everything…

And you’re especially prone to getting sick right now, Shinkai-senpai, so please don’t push yourself, okay…?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata smileconfident %}
i will be okay~ i will simply [hold] shinobu in my arms. shinobu’s [body temperature] is high, after all~

he is like a [water-heating pad]~ warming up, warming up…♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shinobu worried %}
Wai—I cannot move like this! Please spare me, Shinkai-dono~!?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki yare %}
You’re free to mess about, but don’t get too rowdy now. The Eve’s Eve Live wasn’t originally a job for us…

So the stage is too narrow for five people to comfortably perform on.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori sad3 %}
Yeah, it <em>is</em> pretty cramped… I’m huge as it is, so I’m probably just getting in the way…?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki frown %}
Mm~… Nagumo isn’t here right now, as he said he had something to do, so there’s a bit of leeway at the moment.

But for performing on stage, three or four people is likely as far as we can go.

It’s because the unit that was scheduled to perform the Eve’s Eve Live at first was a duo, so the stage wasn’t set up to be too spacious.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata northinking %}
a duo… could it be, that person…? he takes the [day off] when the weather is [bad], so~

he is someone who loves [perfection], after all.[^1]
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki norsmile %}
Mm. That’s why I thought 2wink would be just the right people for this stage, but are those two doing alright?

If they’re in good enough shape to perform, I’d love to ask them to join the live show too, but…

They looked to be in the middle of an argument when we showed up, so maybe that won’t be possible. I’m from an entirely different unit, so while I’m aware it isn’t my place to be speaking on their behalf…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki scold %}
A Christmas that has kids with gloomy faces is the same as a Christmas tree without a star at the very top, y’know!

It just doesn’t feel complete at all…! They can shine so much brighter, I just know it!
{% endbubble %}

## Chapter 2

{% bubble Chiaki fist %}
In any case… Sengoku, Takamine, could you two go and check on how 2wink’s doing for now?

For the live show, we’ll rotate between two people performing at a time, and then three later!

If 2wink are doing well enough to perform, then we’ll ask them to rotate between us.

The optimal scenario is making it look as though it’s a joint live between Ryuseitai and 2wink.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori curious %}
I’m in favor of that, since I’d be able to take it easy by performing less, but… Are you sure it’s alright for us to split the achievements with another unit…?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shinobu srsthinking %}
Yuuta-kun might be against that…

It’ll look as though we’re inviting them out of pity, so he may reject it entirely… Or to be more specific, it appears he wants to make 2wink famous through the two’s strengths alone.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki yare %}
It’s true that it’d be help they never asked for… But they’re students from the same school as us; we may compete sometimes, but we can <em>never</em> allow ourselves to crush one another.

…I’m fed up with the idea of beating each other down.

2wink is a unit made up of first years only, right? They have no choice but to rely on other units’ help at the start.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki norsmile %}
That’s nothing to be ashamed of—Please let them know that.

Be sure to look out for Hinata-kun especially. Based on my own judgement… He’s bearing a much heavier, complicated burden than Yuuta-kun.

He’s only a first year, yet he’s acting as a unit leader, y’know? He must be going through abnormal hardships in order to protect his castle.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki nod %}
And yet… That kid’s always got a smile on his face. Unlike me, who was always crying when I had just become a leader.

I have to protect that smile. How could I call myself an ally of justice if I fail to do that?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki niyaclosed %}
Isn’t that right, you guys!? So go on now! Leave this place to Kanata and I for now, and head over to 2wink!

Go make a miracle happen! The kind you’d see on Christmas…☆
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori sigh %}
This guy really talks with energy alone and nothing else… I really don’t wanna do it, though… Being near anyone feeling down just makes me feel depressed along with them…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shinobu fist %}
I-It will be alright! I shall also do my utmost best together with you, Midori-kun!

We must make haste while the opportunity allows! Now, let’s depart! Yuuta-kuuun, we’re on our way~!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori surprised %}
Woah, woah—Don’t drag me with you~… Jeez, when did you get so aggressive too, Sengoku-kun…

And here I thought you and I were in this together, as people-shy companions… But instead you went ahead without me and made friends…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shinobu surprised %}
Huh— Um…? Was that not okay…!? “Friends” and “companions” are two different things… Or to be more precise, Midori-kun’s also a precious soul buddy of mine! ☆[^2]
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori sad2 %}
It’s fine, really… Friends are just troublesome to have anyway… Uu, why does this kinda feel like when a sibling brings home their lover…?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki grin2 %}
Mhm, go on now! I’m expecting lots from you, my comrades…☆
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata norsmile %}
are you sure it is okay, chiaki~? leaving it to the [children] alone…?

wouldn’t it be [faster] if you were to go there [yourself]…?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki grin %}
That may be so. But the ones who make up the next generation will always be the kids.

I can’t seem to stop myself from spoiling them a little too much… And if they end up getting into the habit of relying on their seniors every time there’s trouble, they won’t be able to sustain themselves on their own in the next school year.

Anyway, you’ll need to get fired up, Kanata. If you stay listless as usual, the audience will grow bored and leave, y’know?

It’d be awful there wasn’t a single audience member left by the time Nagumo and the others come back.

Let’s solidify our foundation and maintain things as they are now—All so that we give a present to our juniors: a stage where they can shine as bright as possible.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata v2 %}
yes, yes, i understand~ ‘senpais’ have it so rough, don’t you think~… i cannot move my [body] much when it is cold.

but i have to at least [pretend] to be a [good kid]… or [santa-san] will not come visit me.

i suppose i have no choice~… let me show you all my [serious] side~♪[^3]
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki grin %}
Yeah! If possible, show that serious side always! You’re far too capricious most of the time!

Well, it’s alright, though… It’s time! Let’s start the Eve’s Eve Live!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata v2 %}
okaaay~ everyone~ merry christmaaas~♪
{% endbubble %}

{% img /img/es/eventstory/christmaslive/chiakibcg.jpg %}

{% bubble Kanata v2 %}
it has been a while since the last time we [sang] as just the two of us, hasn’t it\~… chiaki\~♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki grin2 %}
Mhm! The passionate bloodstream of my younger self is flowing back into me! Let’s sing with everything we’ve got, Kanata! It’s time to wish upon a star! Merry Christmas…☆
{% endbubble %}

## Translation Notes

[^1]: This is referring to Valkyrie.

[^2]: He says soulmate, and in Japanese, this can be used to refer to someone who walks down the same path of fate/goals as you, or to someone you have deep connections with from a previous life. As an interesting note, Ryuseitai sings lyrics similar to this concept in one of their songs, <a href="/bokura_no_stella">Bokura no Stella</a> (set 1 year and a half after this story).

[^3]: He’s referencing a classic Kaoru line, seen in <a href="https://ensemble-stars.fandom.com/wiki/Melody_in_the_Dark_(Lyrics)">Melody in the Dark</a>.
