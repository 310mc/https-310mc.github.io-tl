<th>(Huh? Is that… Otogari-senpai over there?)</th>

<th>(Why’s he standing right at the door to the café…? Is he debating whether or not to go inside?)</th>

<th>(Since he’s someone I know, I don’t think I should ignore him… But I’m not close enough with him to greet him, either… What do I do now…?)</th>

<th>(I guess I’ll stand here and wait for him to move.)</th>

<th>(……)</th>

<th>(…………)</th>

<th>(…Uhhh, I don’t think he’s gonna be moving anytime soon.)</th>

<th>(But the café isn’t even packed, so why isn’t he going in?)</th>

<th>(I can’t just stand here waiting… I should greet him and go inside already.)</th>

H-Hello…?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Adonis %}
Oh, Takamine.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
What’s wrong? Is there something on your mind…?

<th>(Ah, crap— I spoke more than necessary ‘cause he seemed to be at a loss over something. I was only planning to greet him and move on with my life…)</th>
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Adonis %}
Mm, I came here to try the new desserts they added to the menu, but I can’t decide which one to eat.

I suppose I could get both, but I wouldn’t be able to savor them nearly as much with my attention split between the two.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
<th>(Whaaat, that’s *it…*?)</th>

Um… Then how about we each order one? I’m actually here for a parfait, myself.

And if either of us wanna try the other’s dessert, we could always share a bit…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Adonis %}
Does that mean you’ll eat with me? Thank you. You’re very kind, Takamine.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
U-Um, I haven’t even done anything yet…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Niki %}
Welcome~!

Oh, it’s the veggie boy and the meat boy![^1] Feel free to take a seat wherever you like~♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Adonis %}
Shiina-senpai calls you the veggie boy, I see.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
Yeah, it's ‘cause I deliver veggies here sometimes… And you’re the meat boy, huh? I kinda feel a connection…♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Niki %}
Takamine-kun, thanks for the new dessert idea you submitted to our contest the other day!

Everyone agreed to add your Mascot Character Parfait to the menu! You’re totally gonna be trying it out today, right?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
Umm… Otogari-senpai, may I get the Mascot Character Parfait?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Adonis %}
Of course, go ahead. I thought the cute animal-designed ice cream was an impressive idea—

But it never occurred to me that you might’ve been the one behind it. You’re incredible, Takamine.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
Oh, no… I just thought of all my greatest dreams and put them together into a dessert, that’s all… It’s way more impressive that they made my idea a reality…

<th>(Otogari-senpai really goes right to praising, huh… He’s so genuine about it that it makes me feel awkward…)</th>
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Adonis %}
Shiina-senpai, I’d like the Pretty Pudding a la Mode.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Niki %}
Coming right up~ I’m about to take my break, so could I come eat with you guys after I make your dessert?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
Huh? Are you asking me…?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Niki %}
Nahaha, who else would I be asking? ‘Course it’s you two.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
But we’ve barely talked before…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Niki %}
Mmm? Is there some kinda problem?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
I mean… I guess… not, but…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Niki %}
Alrighty, then I’ll take that as a yes! I’ll whip ‘em up for you in a jiffy.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
Um, okay…

<th>(Ughhh, I didn’t get the chance to refuse. His pushiness is kinda scary…)</th>
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Heading %}
Ten minutes later
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Niki %}
Here they are! Two Mascot Character Parfaits—one for Takamine-kun, and one for me— and one Pretty Pudding a la Mode~!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
Wow, it’s so cuuute…! I’m amazed at how you managed to make every single detail of my drawing a reality… Man, it’d be such a waste to eat this.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Niki %}
It’s tiiime to feast~!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
Eep!? He sliced the mascot’s face in half…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Niki %}
This is the most efficient way to eat it~♪ *<th>(Nom, nom)</th>*
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Adonis %}
Shiina-senpai, your manner of eating is quite pleasing to the eye; you ate so much of it in one clean bite.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
<th>(T-That was traumatizing to watch… I’m just gonna focus on my parfait for comfort…)</th>

<th>(Alright, time to take a photo, and—there… This really feels like a dream come true; I didn’t expect to actually win the contest.)</th>
{% endbubble %}

{% img /img/es/idolstory/party_animal_invasion/cg.jpg %}

{% bubble Midori %}
<th>(I wanna indulge in this moment for as long as I can, but my family’s always told me that the Wasteful Ghost would haunt me if I waste my food…)</th>[^2]

<th>(I’ll eat it once the ice cream starts to melt. For now, I’ll enjoy looking at it for as long as I can…♪)</th>
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Adonis %}
You look really happy, Takamine.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
Huh? Y-You think so…? I love mascots, and, um… I’m sorry if you think that’s creepy.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Adonis %}
Not at all. It makes me happy to see someone else enjoy what they love from the bottom of their heart.

Don’t mind me. Please keep enjoying yourself.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Niki %}
*<th>(Gobbles, gulps)</th>…* You really do love mascots, huh? You wrote super passionately about them in your contest entry.

Oh, speaking of mascots—Did you check out the mascot character bakery that opened up recently?

I stopped by to check their menu out the other day, and they had a huge variety of stuff. It was pretty cool!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
Um, I did wanna visit it, but… When I was out walking the other day, people kept coming up and telling me about how they’ve been supporting my work, and stuff…

So I’ve been trying to be careful about when I go out… It doesn’t help that those sorta places usually have lots of girls, too…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Adonis %}
I know how you feel, Takamine. I have a hard time going to cute shops, myself.

Though, I’m also quite interested in that bakery…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Niki %}
Then I’ll make their Mascot Cake for you and Otogari-kun the next time you drop by.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
What, is that really alright with you?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Niki %}
Yeah! It’ll be my thanks for delivering meat and veggies to the café all the time~♪

Besides, if it’s just for nutrition, then I can eat on my own, but—

It’s way tastier to eat food with other people, yeah~?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
U-Um… Thank you…

<th>(Shiina-senpai scared me at first ‘cause of his party animal vibe, and he wouldn’t stop getting close to me…)</th>

<th>(But if there’s something we could enjoy together, maybe it won’t be so tough to talk with him…?)</th>
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Rinne %}
Wassuuup~ Ya boy Rinne’s here~♪

I wiped out my whole wallet on pachinko, so gimme somethin’ to eat, Ni—Oh, what’s this?

Well, if it isn’t Otto~ and Midorinrin! You two seem to be eatin’ somethin’ tasty!

Why dontcha share a bite or two with your bro here? C’mon, I’m only askin’ for a li’l…♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Adonis %}
Is “Otto~” meant to be me?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
*“Midorinrin”…!?* Urghhh, party animals really do freak me out…!
{% endbubble %}
