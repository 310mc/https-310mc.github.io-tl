Anego, thanks so much for preparin' a lot for us this time around!

We also made sure to get ourselves ready for this live show.

We all got a lotta coaching from Midori-kun for the Tropical Live.

            It was hard more than it was fun, honestly~…

            Midori-kun was like a demonic drill sergeant, to the point it's almost unbelievable he's usually way more passive…

            We're gonna perform with mascots, so he taught us how to give off a more soft energy. But Morisawa-senpai and I couldn't get it down right…
            {% endbubble %}
            {% bubble Tetora frown %}
            I had no idea it'd be so tough to bring out a soft atmosphere.

            Hmm, I've never thought 'bout how a mascot character feels, but… I think I'm startin' to get it.

            I hold nothin' but respect for all the mascots for being able to behave in a soft, relaxed way.

Thanks to this job, I've gotten a much deeper understandin' of mascot characters.

Oh yeah, I actually got curious 'bout 'em and looked 'em up a li'l, and I found an interesting character.

It's a mascot that does martial arts, so I felt a connection~♪

            {% bubble Tetora awkward %}
            You mean a collab like this one? I'm sorta interested, but…

            I don't have as much love for mascots as Midori-kun does, so I feel like it'd be rude of me.

            {% bubble Tetora v2 %}
            This mascot is similar to me…? Is that somethin' to be happy 'bout?

            But it's a mascot that pours all its energy into training, so it's not so bad bein' compared to it~♪

            I know right!? Its charm point is how hard it works as a martial artist!

            I couldn't watch its journey to getting the black belt without tears in my eyes, y'know…!

This outfit is meant to match with "Tropical Island Troppeys," right?

But it's still made to look cool, so I like it! Most importantly, Midori-kun's super happy 'bout it too.

You made it, right, Anego? That makes me so happy~♪

            I can't thank ya enough, Anego. I can't wait for the performance to start!

            We're gonna do our absolute best to bring out the charms of "Tropical Island Troppeys" to the max!

            Really? I'm so happy to hear that from ya, Anego!

            Now I *really* feel like we're gonna have awesome work as Yuruseitai in the future~! Please pay close attention to Ryuseitai's powered up form!

            {% bubble Tetora awkward %}
            You'll make an outfit that's much more closer to what a mascot's like? I do think that'd have an impact on the audience, but…

            Personally, I think this outfit is perfectly balanced, y'know…? Midori-kun might be happy 'bout that idea, though.
