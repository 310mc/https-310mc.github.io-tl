Uu, it's not here either… Where the heck did I drop it…?

It wasn't in the office's hallway, nor in the TV studio… At this point, I'll have to call the police station to report a lost item…

Woah—! Anzu-san…!? Please don't scare me like that…!

Are you also interested in this mascot character, Anzu-san?

Pop-dayuu's getting a lot of attention on social media~♪ I've been watching their videos lately myself.

I just got recently got me this keychain, so I'm really glad you found it, Anzu-san.

            It goes to show how important it is to let people know what your favorite things are.

            It's 'cause you were aware that I like mascots that you thought to pick it up, so… I'll keep declaring my love for mascots to people…

This mascot has been trending on social media lately…

Their name is "Pop-dayuu"; their face is a music symbol.[^1]

I've only watched performances of them, but I hope I can meet them for real one day…

            Actually, I heard Pop-dayuu is gonna come to the shopping mall soon…!

            I can show you, then. I have it on my phone, so…

            Look! Can you believe that something like *this* can produce such music..? It's no wonder they're trending as a master of the shamisen.

            Really…? I feel like the cuteness this mascot has is different from Shinpai-senpai's soothing air…

            But I guess the soft expression is sooort of similar to him…?
