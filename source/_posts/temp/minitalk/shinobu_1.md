Ah! Anzu-dono~! I was not aware you were in the StarPro office!

…Hmhm, so you just finished a meeting. Please do rest now!

I just finished my job, so I came to complete a survey for a variety show I will appear in soon. I made sure to fill the survey with my answers~♪

            Fuheh, I am sure the person who made this survey would be pleased to see that I wrote a lot~♪

            I may even be able to seize another job through this, you never know!

The upcoming show I will perform in will be about entertainers demonstrating a peculiar cuisine specialty.

I will have to make the food in the studio itself, so I am a little nervous…

Ah, of course, the cuisine I will be making is hyorogan![^1]

<div class="minitalk" character="Anzu">
    <div class="minitalk-option">
        <div class="minitalk-option_header">
            …Would that be considered a cuisine?
        </div>
        <div class="minitalk-option_content">
            {% bubble Shinobu v2 %}
            Of course! You have to cut the ingredients, mix them, crush them, and then roll!

            You have to cook them on a fire before mixing them, so they're the perfect cuisine for this~♪

    <div class="minitalk-option">
        <div class="minitalk-option_header">
            It suits the theme perfectly.
        </div>
        <div class="minitalk-option_content">
            {% bubble Shinobu v2 %}
            Heh~♪ Hyorogan isn't anything peculiar to me, but it is a peculiar cuisine to the world…

            Thus, I hope to convey the beauty of ninjas through hyorogan!

            {% bubble Shinobu v2 %}
            Hyorogan isn't very widespread, so I am sure it will have an impact on the viewers.

            I hope this will be a wonderful opportunity to make people learn all about the beauty of hyorogan~♪

Everyone will taste-test the food made in the show…

So I would like to make an especially tasty type of hyorogan this time.

I will borrow the dorm's kitchen for a while and practice a lot until the show!

            Huh!? You would like to help me!? That'd be a gamechanger~!

            However, you cannot enter the dormitory… So I would like to ask you to taste-test it once I've made it!
