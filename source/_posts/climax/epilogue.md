<div class="msr-location">
    <p><span><b>Location:</b> At the fountain (White Day)</span></p>
</div>

{% img /img/es/eventstory/climax/epilogue1_1.jpg %}

{% bubble Eichi smile %}
Anzu-chan, the moon is pretty tonight, isn’t it?

Fufu, looks like it’ll be a while until the sun is up.

Tori and Yuzuru worked really hard and got through the first half with a good score, so… *fine*’s turn in the festival will be quite a bit later.

I wonder what kind of repayment those kids will give Wataru and me, and to the other seniors who’ll be leaving? I'm thrilled to find out.

Fufu, of course you, as the producer, know exactly what *fine* will be doing in the second half, but…

“Don’t tell me! I’ll imagine it myself!”

That was my attempt at imitating Tsukinaga-kun. I’d prefer it if you didn’t take away the blissful moments of gazing at a present and imagining what could be inside of it.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Eichi curious %}
…Anzu-chan?

Oh my, I was wondering why you weren’t responding. You’ve fallen asleep.

It did seem like a lot of hard work for you once again… You ran around doing all sorts of things for multiple units.

But that’s exactly why you should wake up after we’ve reached the auditorium for the second half of the festival.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Eichi smile %}
Your beloved idols are all waiting to give you the gifts reserved just for you.

If you sleep through that and miss it, they might be disappointed.

Fufu, but at the very least, you should relax and rest up until that joyful moment begins.

I’ll carefully carry you bridal style, so that you don’t shake about as we get there. This is my White Day gift to you.

Ahh… For once in a long time, I feel like I can sleep soundly tonight without any worries.

One day, when I sleep forever — when I die — I want it to be with this kind of feeling.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Subaru %}
………
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Eichi %}
Hm? Hello there, Subaru-kun. What a coincidence that we meet here.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Subaru %}
Ah! Heya, Eichi-senpai! Good evening~☆
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Eichi angry %}
Shhh… You really don't pay attention to your surroundings, do you? Anzu-chan is sleeping, so could you stay quiet?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Subaru surprised %}
Woah—! Sorry. Wait, why're you carrying Anzu? Were you two on good terms?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Eichi %}
Yes. Well, I want to think that we were at least able to become friends.

Fufu, you know… It seems like Keito is unusually going all-out this time around.

So the Student Council duties were delayed a bit, and Anzu-chan and I tried to finish up the rest of it at the Student Council office.

I caused Keito a lot of trouble, so I wanted to pay him back, even if a little.

In any case, we finished most of the work, and it was about time for the second half of the festival to start. That’s why the two of us were happily heading to the auditorium.

But on the way there, she started crouching down… I was worried for a second, but it looked like she just fell asleep.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Subaru %}
Hmm, I see. Wanna switch places, Eichi-senpai? You don’t have much strength, right? Isn't it rough for you to carry someone all on your own?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Eichi %}
No, it’s fine. You must be busy too, what with helping UNDEAD and all…

So just leave this to your bored senior~♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Subaru %}
Alright. I’ll leave it to you, but bring her back later, okay?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Eichi %}
I will. I almost want to keep her for myself, but love is something to be shared.

Fufu, we’ll obviously get cold if we keep standing around and talking in a place like this. Let's each head off to where we should be before we catch a cold.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Subaru %}
Okay then, see ya~♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Subaru curious %}
……Actually, Eichi-senpai.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Eichi %}
Hm? What is it, Subaru-kun?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Subaru serious %}
Did you have fun in the three years you were here?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Eichi smile %}
Of course. All the days I spent here were shining and glittering more than a jewel ever could.

I'm sure the rest of you students will also get to enjoy a bright, youthful life, just as I did — perhaps even more than I ever did.

Ahh, that makes me jealous.

…Oh, that’s right. *Yumenosaki Academy’s Top Idol* is my title, but…

Is it alright if I entrust that title to you? Until Tori has fully grown up?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Subaru %}
Hm? I don’t really want something like that, though.

But I like to take what I’m given~♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Eichi awkward %}
I see… Ahh, that’s a relief.

Unlike Valentine's Day, the gift you give on White Day is likely to make the person happy in the end anyway, but it doesn't change the fact that it makes you nervous.

Fufu, well then, see you later. It’s a shame, but it’s time to part.

Once you’re done with what you have to do, come over to the auditorium. It seems that Ryuseitai has something interesting planned.

So you should come to watch and enjoy your senior and junior of the same club in their iconic moment.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Subaru grin %}
Mhm, I totally intend to watch over that.

Heheh, Chi~chan-senpai’s number one favorite may be Takamin and all, but…

It still does frustrate me a little that Takamin gets to have everything for himself.

Not to mention, it looks like he’s gonna become the exact kinda hero Chi~chan-senpai hoped for—

So… maybe I should become the exact kinda idol Chi~chan-senpai hoped for.

That’ll be our repayment to him, and today will mark the memory of that first step.

I’m pretty hyped, Eichi-senpai.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Eichi grin2 %}
Me too, Subaru-kun. Ahh, doesn’t it make you so glad to be born?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kaoru v2 %}
Kanata-kuuun! Moricchi~!

Over here, over here! C'mon, Ryusetai’s up next, y'know~♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata smile2 %}
kaoru. …your eyes seem [red]. were you crying?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kaoru v2 %}
Huh!? Why're you so sharp sometimes!? You’re usually a thickheaded alien, y'know!?

I confessed to Anzu-chan knowing I’d be rejected, and lo and behold, I was~! So let me off, alright!?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata v2 %}
ahaha, poor you.

…but, well, our [fight] has probably only just begun.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kaoru v2 %}
Yeah, Sakuma-san also told me something like that~ Just what I’d expect from an Eccentric — You guys have similar ways of comforting people~♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata v2 %}
fufu. kaoru, you will work with rei as an [idol] from here on out, right? i will cheer you on.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kaoru v2 %}
Thanks. You too, Kanata-kun. If things with your family ever gets rough, run away to my place.

You’re always welcome, okay? I’d be good at taking care of someone if it’s only you.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata v2 %}
fufu, for you of all people to be pushing yourself… but thank you.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kaoru v2 %}
You don’t have to thank me. You’re my friend, y'know?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata smile3 %}
yes. …did everything go okay with souma? i am sorry for leaving you to [deal] with everything.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kaoru v2 %}
Yeah. There was one point when it was a bit worrisome, but I think everything's okay for now.

It seems like he got through the first part of the live safely, and now he and the other two from Akatsuki are going to peacefully have fun with the second part.

Heheh, Souma-kun is a real goody boy, after all. If he can’t be happy, nobody can.

…Woops, looks like I’m off. My good pals are still overexcited, they’ve been prancing around even after our live’s been over.

Honestly, they’re such a handful~♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata smile %}
fufu, good job, kaoru. good boy, gooood boy~…♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kaoru v2 %}
Ahaha, the only people who called me a good boy from beginning to end were… my mom and you, Kanata-kun.

Thank you. To be honest, it made me pretty happy.

Right then, bye bye. See you another time, Kanata-kun.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata v2 %}
yes, we will meet again somewhere, kaoru.

…chiaki. you were very [quiet] for once; are you tired?
{% endbubble %}

{% img /img/es/eventstory/climax/epilogue2_2.jpg %}

{% bubble Chiaki idle %}
Ah no, I just thought it’d be rude to interrupt. Even I read the room sometimes, Kanata.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata v2 %}
whaaat~ that is [news] to me.

more importantly… shall we at least [greet] the [children] together?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki v2 %}
Alright, then let’s go to the dressing room backstage. Hopefully they aren’t fighting again.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata v2 %}
i am sure they are [alright]. it seems like they were able to safely [get through] the [first half] of the live.

i am sure they are [having fun] performing after making up~♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki v2 %}
I hope so… Oh, we don’t even need to go backstage; they’ve already shown themselves!

Heeey, my comrades! We’re a little late, but we’re here to cheer you on! ☆
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora angry %}
…Ryusei Punch!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori smile4 %}
Ryusei Kiiick~♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shinobu v2 %}
Ryusei Shuriken~☆
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki surprised %}
Gwah!? W-Why did you suddenly charge at me, my comrades!? Were you brainwashed by the enemy!?
{% endbubble %}

{% img /img/es/eventstory/climax/epilogue2_3.jpg %}

{% bubble Tetora angry2 %}
What “enemy”… You’re both late! We were worried you wouldn’t even come, y'know!? Just what took you so long!?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki surprised %}
Huh? Huh!? Sorry! The people in the shopping district took a liking to us somehow, and we ended up singing on an outdoor stage!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki grin %}
The two of us sang a duet together after so long~♪

Fuhaha! Worry not, Takamine! The greengrocer store is also thriving! ☆
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori sad2 %}
Ughh, there you go again with doing needless—… You’re always like this…

I guess I can’t really complain though, not when you did it in my place…

Were you able to get things done without any problems…? It does sound like it was a great success, though…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki grin %}
Yep! Basically the festival guy, a former Ryuseitai member, helped us out! In the end, we gave all the work to him and rushed right over!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori curious %}
Festival guy… Ahh, that weirdo…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata v2 %}
yes, that [rogue].
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki grin %}
Yeah, he caused me a lot of trouble when he just went and left Ryuseitai.

So at the very least, before school ends, he’s helping us out right now as a former brother-in-arms who wore the same uniform.

That aside! There are no problems over on that side, so you can enjoy yourselves in the live show without any worry!

We’ll be watching you from the audience! Watching over your very lives that inherited the heart of justice…!

Ahh, just seeing your majestic selves makes me feel like I'm about to burst into tears!

Hang in there, Ryuseitai, do your best! Don’t lose now, Ryuseitai, do your best!!

<th>(Heheheh. For a while there, I was unsure how this would go, but we may actually be able to get through Repayment Festival to the very end.)</th>

<th>(What a relief~ But it is still not the time to be slacking around.)</th>

<th>(In fact, it is going to get rougher from here on out… For the coming days after our seniors graduate…)</th>

<th>(Just thinking about it now makes my stomach hurt…)</th>
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shinobu sad %}
<th>(And to be honest, Tetora-kun and Midori-kun have not completely made up, either.)</th>

<th>(Midori-kun arrived pretty late, so we decided to leave the talking for later and just do our best for now…)</th>

<th>(We quickly rehearsed together and rushed everything up until this point.)</th>

<th>(With how much of a mess it has been, it is truly a miracle we managed to get past the first part…)</th>

<th>(Of course, that is only how we feel about it mentally. Our actual performance has been going fine.)</th>

<th>(We have grown. No, actually, with everyone’s strength combined, we managed to overcome many hardships…)</th>

<th>(Those hardships united us as allies with a bond stronger than friends or family, and has helped us hone ourselves.)</th>
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shinobu smile %}
<th>(With every dance step, every song, we grew closer, stronger… Whenever I remember all of that, I start to really feel like we have changed.)</th>

<th>(So maybe… we'll be okay. I'm sure of it.)</th>
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shinobu angry2 %}
<th>(At the very least, that’s what *I'm* going to keep believing in.)</th>[^1]

<th>(This isn't our last time or anything.)</th>
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora smile3 %}
<th>(…Ahaha, it’s not every day that I see Shinobu-kun with a serious look on his face.)</th>

<th>(That’s how much we’re on his mind, I bet. He’s so concerned ‘bout us that he can’t even mess around.)</th>

<th>(Shinobu-kun’s looks are surprisingly dignified. He’s manly, even.)</th>
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora sad2 %}
<th>(If he wore stylish clothes and pulled his hair up like how his beloved Isara-senpai does… He would pull it off perfectly and thrive just fine the traditional idol way.)</th>

<th>(And yet, despite that, he continued to stay by our side. Even if he was all alone, he would continue to enjoy what he loves to the very end…)</th>

<th>(And continue enjoying life as himself, as a master of his own castle.)</th>

<th>(Isn’t that so cool? I admire that ‘bout him so much.)</th>
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora awkward %}
<th>(I dunno if someone hollow like me… is even qualified to lead guys as cool as Shinobu-kun and Midori-kun…)</th>

<th>(But I’ve been asked to take up the commander role. For the first time in my life, I’ve been tasked with something that is seen as, “something that can only be entrusted to you, Nagumo.”)</th>

<th>(So I’m going to take risks and devote my whole self to this.)</th>
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora smile4 %}
<th>(I’m clumsy, so I can’t do things right at all.)</th>

<th>(It won't go according to how I hope, like it did for Taichou or Taishou, or even a hero from a tokusatsu… not even like a protagonist from a story.)</th>

<th>(But… No matter how much I fail, no matter how muddy I get, no matter how pathetically hard I cry… I won’t run away anymore. I’ll stand firm.)</th>

<th>(A loss isn’t a loss if you refuse to accept defeat to the very end.)</th>

<th>(Even if no one cares  me anymore, even if I become hated, and the people around me leave…)</th>

<th>(At the very least I, as part of Ryuseitai, will stand my ground with the legacy of my seniors.)</th>
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora grin2 %}
<th>(Even if the only thing I can do is to stand tall. Just like what Taishou told me ‘bout how Taichou was in the past… I’ll keep fighting without giving up.)</th>

<th>(Even if people laugh at me and say I’m incompetent, I’m sure at least Midori-kun and Shinobu-kun'd accept me for who I am. They’ll come rushing to me, picking me back up when I’m ‘bout to fall.)</th>

<th>(No, I’m sure they’d even fight alongside me. I can believe in that, right?)</th>
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora smile5 %}
<th>(And in reality, Shinobu-kun has always been by my side. Midori-kun came back too, even if it took him a while.)</th>

<th>(The bonds we’ve sewn and strengthened together with everyone throughout this whole year… They’re not fragile at all, but tough and invincible.)</th>
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora grin2 %}
<th>(This isn’t dependence, it’s *trust*. I’ll take this to heart, and keep saying how I feel from now on!)</th>

<th>(I won’t hold back anymore, I won’t go easy on anyone, I won’t fear the idea of being hated.)</th>

<th>('Course, it’s still scary, but I shouldn’t run away 'cuz of that. That’s not what it means to be a hero…)</th>

<th>(Yeah, that’s right, *I* wanna be a hero too.)</th>

<th>(I wanna be a cool man among men. Even if it’s difficult for me right now, one day, surely…)</th>
{% endbubble %}

{% img /img/es/eventstory/climax/epilogue3_1.jpg %}

{% bubble Midori idle %}
…Tetora-kun.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora v2 %}
Hm? What’s up, Midori-kun…?

We’re in the middle of our performance, y'know? Talking isn’t allowed.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori smile %}
Ahaha, you're sounding like a leader…♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora curious %}
Do you have a complaint ‘bout that? Ah, could it be that you wanted to be the next “Ryusei Red” or something?

You’ve always been real close with Taichou, after all… It wouldn’t be strange if you’ve been thinking of inheriting that color all along.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora hmph %}
But it’s *not* allowed. I’ve been aimin' for the red color for a long time.

I’m not giving it away, not even to you.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora grin %}
If you've got any complaints, then we'll take it to a match and decide things with our fists, mano a mano!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori sigh %}
You’re so wild… I’m fine being Green, in fact it’s a color I fairly like…

And besides, I don’t really wanna fight…

I mean, I’ve always been this way… I’ve never really had a fight with someone before 'cause I’d always run away before it could've happened…

So I’m not really used to this, I feel conflicted inside, and a lot feels wrong…

But just this once, I thought to myself that this isn’t something to run away from and let slide…
{% endbubble %}

## Chapter 4

{% bubble Midori frown %}
Actually, even if I did try to run away — Morisawa-senpai, Shinkai-senpai, or Anzu-san…

Someone will interfere and grab me by the neck to say, “come over here already!”, and pull me back to the problems I should face head-on…

But… Just relying on others to do that for me is so childish, and I hate it…

I may be a good-for-nothing guy who’s only physically grown up, but I’m not a baby or an infant…

My actual mental growth was slow, unlike my body's… Once again, I’m a dunce who took forever to come rushing back to all of you…

But I love you all, I wanna be together with you all… Someone like me may just be a huge eyesore, but I wanna stay by everyone’s side…

I told you that you’re neither my family nor my siblings, but I wanna amend that…

People who’d get that angry just for my sake — even if they aren’t my family — are people I should treasure just like family, if not more…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori sad2 %}
If I had left things like that and ran away, I would have never been able to show my face to anyone ever again…

It'd be unforgivable just to keep breathing… And then I really *would* get depressed and die…

So please, let me be by your sides. Even if this is only a dream, I don’t wanna wake up from it yet.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora grin2 %}
Ahaha, it’s too late to be modest now after everything, Midori-kun.

Have we ever once said “Don’t come with us” or “Go away” to you?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori v2 %}
Huuuh? You *did!* You told me I should’ve just disappeared!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora surprised2 %}
Wha—!? Sorry, I wasn’t thinking straight back then and ended up saying somethin' I didn’t mean!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori hmph %}
Didn’t mean it, huh!? It hurt me so much, I could’ve died…!!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shinobu surprised %}
H-Heeey, you two!? No fighting! We’re still in the middle of our live, you know~!
{% endbubble %}

{% img /img/es/eventstory/climax/epilogue4_1.jpg %}

{% bubble Kanata v2 %}
hehe, that’s right~ if you were to [chatter] during [combat]… you would immediately die~♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki grin %}
Yep! It’s just as Kanata said! This is extremely important, so carve it into your hearts! How long are you planning to let the filler arc run!? It’s time for you to get back on track with the live!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora surprised %}
What the…!? Huh? Taichou? Shinkai-senpai?

W-Why're you two on stage? And you’re even wearing clothes that match our outfits for Repayment Festival…!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki smug %}
Is there any problems with that? We’re also Ryuseitai, at least for now!

Heheh. Takamine said something particularly interesting, so when I asked Anzu about it…

Oh, to be clear, it was while I was giving her something for White Day!

Anyway, so it seemed like she had already prepared outfits for us, too… It was her who sewed Ryuseitai's outfits this time.

Because she thought to herself, “It'll probably be the five of them on stage like always.”

So she said, “I ended up making outfits for all five of you\~” with her tongue stuck out like she was giggling! It was cute\~☆

That face she made was definitely on purpose! Is she one of those cute villain ladies who appear in tokusatsu or what!?

In any case, there are outfits for us too, so it’d be a waste not to wear them, wouldn’t it?

And besides, this may be the last chance for the five of us to be on stage together.

It'll be the last memory we make together. But if we’re in your way, then we'll step back.

But I *really* just can’t sit back and watch anymore!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki frown %}
Ahhh, it was really rough for me this time around! I wanted to say something, to do something!

I wanted to spend all my energy being busy! To fix all your problems, like I always did!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki grin %}
I love you guys so much! But it’s because I love you that I shouldn’t be carrying you around and spoiling you forever!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata v2 %}
that’s right, chiaki~

if you get too involved with the aquarium’s [fish], then they, like the [children], will die by the [stress]. we should only be watching from afar.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata smile3 %}
fufufu, it was also rough on me to only be [watching], though.

i am [relieved]. you three will be [alright] even if we are not here… you will be able to weather any [storm].

it is sad to say [goodbye], but i now look [forward] to our [next meeting] after you have grown to be even more [splendid].

*puka, puka…♪*

{% bubble Midori smile5 %}
Ahaha… These two never miss a chance to take the spotlight, huh…?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shinobu curious %}
W-What should we do? Tetora-kun…?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora smile3 %}
Well, it’s fine, isn’t it? We’re wrapping things up anyway.

And our audience would want it to be the five of us together as Ryuseitai.

At least once, I want them to witness a miracle: the five of us together here, in our gallant glory.

We'll have to get used to Ryuseitai being just the three of us, but that's not until later, right?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora awkward %}
Us three won’t be able to fill the leading roles by ourselves just yet, so I’ll gratefully let our seniors interfere this time around.

Besides, it’s a blessing to know we’re not fightin' alone.

But y'know, you two were meant to be our audience…

You haven’t done any practice, right? You sure you can sing and dance alright?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki grin %}
Fuhaha!! Don’t look down on us, Nagumo! We’re veterans holding three years of experience and hard work in the mud!

It's been a while since our last transformation, but with it, we'll be able to fight on the same level as you guys!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata v2 %}
that’s right~ there is no need to talk about trivial things. instead, focus on what you [must] do.

let's make our [guests] excited as we always do… together~♪

now then, let's begin from what we all [know]… what we always [promise] to do~♪
{% endbubble %}

## Chapter 5

{% bubble Kanata v2 %}
hello! we are ryuseitai! thank you for coming over to see our [live]…♪

all of you probably know [who] we are, but it is a [standard] for us to do this, so~ first, we will begin with our [introductions].

the blue flame is the mark of mystery! i have come from the blue sea~♪

ryusei blue! shinkai kanata…☆ *<th>(sparkle)</th>*
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shinobu v2 %}
Ahaha, it is unusual for you to be the one to take the initiative, Shinkai-dono.

If we are talking about speed, that would be my area of expertise as a ninja, you know~ But oh well, I will leave it to you so you can look cool~♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata v2 %}
fufu, i am sorry for taking your [forte], shinobu~♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shinobu v2 %}
No problem at all~! To be a ninja is to take three steps back and stay behind others as their shadow.

But even so, I don't want to be forgotten.
{% endbubble %}

{% img /img/es/eventstory/climax/shinobubcg.jpg %}

{% bubble Shinobu v2 %}
Actually… So that I am not forgotten, so that people will not say they don't even know whether I'm here or not… I, too, will loudly and magnificently introduce myself.

The yellow flame is the mark of hope! A single miracle shining into the darkness!

Ryusei Yellow! Sengoku Shinobu…☆

C’mon, c’mon! You do it too, Tetora-kun, Midori-kun! ♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora sad4 %}
Uu~myu… I had a plan for how we were gonna do this, though… Now that everyone’s just doin' as they please, it’ll be tough to get everything back on track.

But that *is* the usual for us anyway.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora grin2 %}
I dunno if I can do things as properly as Taichou did… but I’m gonna burn the flames of justice I inherited to their limit and do my absolute best.
{% endbubble %}

{% img /img/es/eventstory/climax/tetorabcg.jpg %}

{% bubble Tetora v2 %}
As a member of Ryuseitai — No… As the next commander to lead Ryuseitai—

I’m gonna shine bright like the sun. Today, tomorrow, and forever onward. I’ll burn a bright red.

But just for today, I’ll respect that our seniors are here, and introduce myself like this:

The black flame is the mark of effort! The burning fighting spirit, stained with the soil of the earth!

Ryusei Black! Nagumo Tetora…☆
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki grin %}
Fuhahaha! ☆ In my eyes, you’re already dazzling bright like the burning red sun!

Protect Ryuseitai and this world’s peace… Future Taichou!

If anyone can do it, it’s you.

Black absorbs all light, and you can now take all of that stored up energy and let it explode as you please.

I'm sure *you* will be able to use that strength properly.

<th>(…Woops. I shouldn’t be fascinated by the sight right now; I have to introduce myself, too.)</th>

<th>(I’m no longer a kid whose eyes glisten as he watches heroes being heroes—)</th>

<th>(—Because I was able to become the hero I've always longed to be.)</th>

<th>(Heh~♪ Time to introduce myself with the loudest voice and the best smile in history!)</th>
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki shocked %}
The red flame is——Gwah!?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori angry %}
………
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki curious %}
Huh? Um, Takamine? Why did you kick my butt?

Did I do something wrong!? Are you angry!?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori sigh2 %}
Hmph… Well, I *do* dislike the way you're walking on eggshells around me… You don’t have to worry so much, jeez… You’re way too late for that, anyway…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori serious %}
Morisawa-senpai. I’ll at least be honest with you now. I owe you a lot for this whole year.

You may have always been annoying, suffocating, clingy, gross, loud, unpleasant, troublesome, and really gross, but—
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki surprised %}
You said it twice! You said “gross”‬ twice!!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori smile5 %}
But. I think I was also an unpleasant junior who was always lazy and kept snapping back…

So, well… Let’s just call it even.

All the kindness you’ve given me — Even if I spent my whole life trying, I don’t think I could ever fully return the favor. But at the very least, I'll prove to you that your year didn't go to waste.

Thanks to you, even I’ve changed a little… and I'll show that to you now.

When we first met, you asked me, “Won't you become a hero?”

And I never gave you an answer… But now I'll answer you not with words, but with actions.

Even if I did say it with words, you wouldn’t listen anyway…… So please watch my transformation closely.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki grin %}
Ah! That's *Kuuga!* That's *Kamen Rider Kuuga's* line!
{% endbubble %}

{% img /img/es/eventstory/climax/midoribcg.jpg %}

{% bubble Midori smile4 %}
Shut it.

The green flame is the mark of compassion—

The great nature that grows infinitely! Ryusei Green, Takamine Midori…!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki smile3 %}
<th>(Takamine.)</th>

<th>(Ahaha, you finally properly introduced yourself… Even though you always said it was too embarrassing and you didn’t get it… You whined that you didn't want to do it, only doing it as you pleased…)</th>

<th>(So that's your answer, Takamine. Ahh, I'm glad. I'm so relieved.)</th>
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki cry %}
<th>(Ahaha… No good, I really didn't want to cry until after graduation, not in front of the kids at least… But my vision is getting blurry already.)</th>
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori frown %}
Hey, come on now… This isn't the time to be crying, please finish what you have to do. We'd like to hear your usual catchphrase.

Please shine in your own way, as you always have — within the center of everyone.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori smile %}
I never really disliked seeing that… Morisawa-senpai.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki smile4 %}
I see, so that’s how it was all along… That’s good, I’m glad. Ahh, I’m just so glad.

I truly feel rewarded. To be a hero means to not ask for anything in return… but if I’ve been loved and thanked, and brought a smile to someone who was crying—

Then there was value and reason to the desperate fight it took to reach here after all.
{% endbubble %}

{% img /img/es/eventstory/climax/chiakibcg.jpg %}

{% bubble Chiaki smile4 %}
Thank you.

The red flame is the mark of justice! Burning bright red, the sun of life!

Ryusei Red! Morisawa Chiaki!

With the five of us together! We are *Ryuseitai…!*

## Translation Notes
[^1]: He says *boku* here for “I” instead of *sessha* (the typical way Shinobu talks as a ninja), and doesn't end his line with *de gozaru*. The same goes for the lines before and after this one.
