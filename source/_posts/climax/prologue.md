~…♪

*puka, puka…♪*
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kaoru %}
Heyaa~! I’m bored so I came over to hang out! ☆

Hm? Ohh, Kanata-kun! You look like you’re in a good mood~♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata %}
heyaa~… i am not particularly in a [good] mood, kaoru.

i am actually pretty [irritated]. it is very [noisy] outside.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kaoru %}
Ahh, yeah, while on my way here, I saw the Basketball club having a farewell party for the third years.

They’re in that basketball court outside.

They were partying pretty hard, so I guess the noise is reaching all the way here. Moricchi’s stupidly loud, after all.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata %}
moricchi… that is about chiaki, yes?

ufufu, you started [calling] him by that name at some point. it is [wonderful] to see you getting on good terms~ i am almost jealous.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kaoru %}
Heh, if you’re so jealous, maybe I’ll start calling you by “Kanacchi”~♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata %}
please do not joke around.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kaoru %}
Ehhh…!? Sorry, was that overly-friendly? Mmm~ I don’t really get what sets you off…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata %}
hehe… i am just joking, [kaocchi]~♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kaoru %}
Ehh~? Man, you’re always toying around with me…

I don’t really want people to get *too* friendly with me, so I’d rather you call me by my first name.

I know it’s my own fault, but everyone’s been kinda keeping their distance from me…

I mean, even my *family* doesn’t talk to me without attaching a title to my name.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata %}
wouldn’t a girl gladly call you “kaoru”?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kaoru %}
Yeah, I always tried to make sure that girls call me like that as much as possible. It sure makes me wonder what was going on deep inside my head…

But lately I’ve been thinking a lot about stuff, and, well… I’ve stopped meeting up with girls now.

At this point, my emotional comfort is just you and Anzu-chan.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata %}
eh~… that is not something i could really help with.

if you want [emotional comfort], i recommend gazing at the [fishies] and [jellyfishies]. we call it [aquatherapy]. *puka, puka…♪*
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kaoru %}
Mm, yeah. I think when it’s just looking at them through the fish task, it does give me some comfort now.

I think I’m finally starting to understand your feelings a little, Kanata-kun. It took all the way until graduation season, though.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata %}
really? it feels a little less [lonely] to have someone with the [same feelings] as me.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kaoru %}
Mhm.  …But uh, they really <em>are</em> loud out there, huh? I feel like I can’t relax; that party is going off the *rails.*

Knowing the kinda person Moricchi is, parting ways must be kinda sad for him. I wonder if he’s balling his eyes out…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata %}
chiaki wouldn’t cry.

fufu, how about we call over souma and have our own [farewell party] for the [marine bio club]?

i would like to [hand] the [fish tanks] over to souma’s care, as well.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kaoru %}
Mm~… Thing is, I think he hasn’t been showing up lately…? My classmate Hasumi-kun has been worried about him. I don’t think anybody knows where he is right now.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata %}
really? i wonder what is wrong… souma gets easily restless, so it is [worrying].
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kaoru %}
I’m sure he’ll be alright, won’t he? He’s a tough kid when it comes down to it. We can always just support him as his seniors if things are unstable.

Heh, I’d like to do something upperclassman-like for once~♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata %}
fufu, that’s true~ let’s do something that lets him return the favor. i would like to ask him to [take care] of the [fish tanks] starting next year.

but it may be far too many for him to [take care] of all on his own…

so as sad as it may be, i will have to [euthanize] half of them.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kaoru %}
Wh—Did you just say <em>euthanize!?</em> No, don’t! You can’t dispose of living beings just like that…!

You say some shockingly cold-hearted things sometimes, Kanata-kun…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata %}
fufu. we are the [children] of [monsters], after all.

it is [unnatural] for a sea creature to live on land.

if one will only cause trouble, and only be a burden… it means it is time to say [goodbye], yes?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kaoru %}
No, no! It’s completely natural for us to cause trouble and burden each other. That’s how everyone lives, including you and I.

If you hold yourself back from everyone, you won’t even be able to breathe.

And you hate being suffocated — don’t you, Kanata-kun?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata %}
………
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kaoru %}
Besides, if it’s too hard for Souma-kun to manage the aquarium by himself, how about we show up again after graduation then?

I’ll probably be a little busy with work, but I could come visit every once in a while to pass the time~♪

Let’s keep visiting him over and over like shameless graduates, until the club gets new members.

So yeah, no need to force yourself to get rid of stuff and say goodbye to avoid being a “nuisance,” right?

Well, I’m in no position to say that, considering I’m still in the middle of sorting out my own personal matters. …Everything is easier said than done, huh? ♪
