Personally, I want to participate in Repayment Festival, no matter what…

I want to reassure Taichou-dono and Shinkai-dono before they graduate.

I want to show them we've grown so that they can graduate without any fear…!

							Mm… I assume Tetora-kun and Midori-kun feel the same.

        But it feels like neither know how to bring the topic up, and that is why things have been awkward.

        I have to be the one to bring the topic up…!

On that day, I tried to catch up to my seniors as soon as possible, but I failed to…

It really reminded me just how little stamina I have.

I was trying my best to build my stamina up, but it appears that it wasn't enough!

        Having stamina is fundamental as an idol, too~♪

I was worried what would happen for a while, but it seems like we will be able to get through today~♪

Tetora-kun does not seem to be in top-shape, so I am a little concerned about him…

But I shall make sure that I accomplish my duty as part of Ryuseitai…!
