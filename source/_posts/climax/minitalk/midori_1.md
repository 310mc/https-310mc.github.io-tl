Why do I have to go to the basketball court when it's so cold outside…

I just wanna go home and relax…

        But this is the last time we're together, so I'll suck it up and go.

        We'll celebrate our upperclassmen's graduation and have fun with sweets and stuff.

        It almost doesn't feel real that they're graduating, though…

Hello, Anzu-san. What're you doing here so early in the morning…?

Yes, I'm helping my family with the store.

If you're looking for a particular shop, I can help you.

        But avocado isn't a vegetable, actually. It's a fruit.

        They're always next to the veggies, though, so people tend to confuse it for one.

Ah—! I'm so sorry. I was thinking about something while walking, so I didn't notice you…
