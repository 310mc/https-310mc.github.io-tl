Anzu-dono\~ Good morning\~☆

Mm, I'm helping Isara-dono with Student Council work.

I'd do whatever I can for Isara-dono's sake! ♪

There hasn't been any Ryuseitai activities lately, so I haven't been seeing Tetora-kun and Midori-kun as much…

Our classes are different too, so at most, we just phone call or spot each other on the corridors.

Are they both coming to school every day…?

							Mmm… I've been avoiding doing so as my reason to see them is far too trivial, so I would only bother them…

        But I don't want to be incapable of talking to them ever again…!

        I'll try to go visit them now~♪
