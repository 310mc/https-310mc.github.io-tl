You and Sengoku-kun were way too panicked…

You just ran off out of nowhere.

And then even brought over some troublesome people…

Everyone is working hard in preparation for Repayment Festival, huh…

All for the sake of conveying their gratitude through their performance…

Ahh, please don't worry about me.

Our seniors really will graduate, won't they…

A lot has happened the past year…

But the reason we were able to remain as the five of us is also thanks to you, Anzu-san.
