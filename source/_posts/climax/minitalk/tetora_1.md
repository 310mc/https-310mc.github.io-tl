'Sup, Anzu-Anego! ☆ Thanks for all your help in the Dragon King Competition!

Thanks to you, I got to express every bit of my feelings to Taishou!

        You had to do so much back in Chocolat Fes for us, like how to make chocolate and stuff…

        Please don't overwork yourself too much, or you'll hurt yourself.

        I may be the next commander of Ryuseitai, but I can't decide on things with my opinion alone.

        Please give me more time to see if we'll participate or not.

Ossu! Thank you for coming over to the dojo!

But Taishou isn't here right now. He's busy dealing with somethin' in his unit.

{% bubble Tetora awkward %}
But if I'm to be honest, I wish we could've trained a bit longer before he graduates…

						It's 'cuz I've been training as much as I can so I can be on par with Taishou.

        I think I was able to show him I've grown lots in the Dragon King Competition.

        It's all thanks to Taishou and my seniors in Ryuseitai that I've grown this much…♪

        I'm still nowhere near that point, not even on the same footing as him!

        So I'm gonna grow stronger and stronger!

…Hm? Why're you staring at me? Is there somethin' on my face?

I seem more mature? Even you're saying that, Anzu-Anego?

Seng—Shinobu-kun also said something like that to me. Did I really change that much~?

      Yeah, as in Sengoku-kun! I've decided to start calling him by his first name.

      I didn't know what timing would be right to change how I called him at first.
