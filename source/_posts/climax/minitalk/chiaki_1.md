Anzu! What’s up? What are you doing here?

O*ho*, have you come to see the gallant figure of this basketball captain?

This may be your last chance, so let it imprint right into your very eyes…☆

              Mhm, you were looking for Akehoshi for something, I see.

              He’s gone to buy himself a drink, so he isn’t here.

              He’ll likely be back if you wait around, though.

Ooh, Anzu! You're here at just the right time!

Truth is, I was on my way to the Student Council Office with Kanata, but we strayed off somewhere in the middle…

Have you seen him anywhere?

              I see. Just where did he go off to?

              …Oh, the figure I see over there looks to be Kanata?

              Anzu, sorry for stopping you for this! Farewell…!

              Ahh, honestly, I can’t take my eyes off of him for one second.

              Oh well, if I wait here at the corridor, we’ll surely meet each other again.

              Would you like to chat until Kanata comes back? ☆

              Hmmm? Is he looking through the window…?

              If I remember clearly, you can see the fountain from that window, right? Honestly, he can be troublesome when it comes to this.

              …Woah!! I think he’s planning to dive in from here!! I-I’m going to go stop him…!!

Huh, there really are heart-shaped ornaments wherever you go…

Oh right, it’s going to be white day soon. I almost forgot!

Anzu, what do you want as your white day gift?

              And I’ve left Repayment Festival to the kids, since it's junior-focused…

              So I'm sorry to say that there isn’t any work I can give you.

              But sadly, there’s nothing I’m doing for my unit right now.

              Alright then! How about I go find out if there’s anything you could do…♪
