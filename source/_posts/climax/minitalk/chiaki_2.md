I’m being asked to take jobs after graduation by the people I work with in the industry.

Thanks to their help, I won’t have so much trouble with work for awhile.

Tenshouin lent me a hand too, which has helped me become one step closer to my dreams.

              I can’t become a hero in a tokusatsu show just like that.

Mm, I can’t believe Takamine saw me that day…

I’m embarrassed at how hard I tried to put up a front to be cool…

It actually makes me look pathetic instead, doesn’t it…?

              Graduations really are sad.

I thought those three would be fine on their own, but there were a few moments that were cutting it extremely close.

But they aren’t kids anymore. I’m sure they’ll be able to take care of Ryuseitai.

And Kanata and I will be able to graduate without any worries…☆

              Graduating and leaving your beloved kids behind really feels lonely, though…

              To be honest, what I really want from the bottom of my heart is to spend more days with you and Ryuseitai in this academy.

              Kanata and I both believe in that!
