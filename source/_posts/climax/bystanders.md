{% bubble Kaoru v2 %}
Huh~ So you’re gonna be some sorta multi-talented entertainer after graduation, Moricchi?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki frown %}
I’m not sure what to call it exactly, but I’m mainly going to be performing idol activities. Fortunately, there are a lot of people in the industry who are willing to get in touch with me.

I’m going to be packed with work as soon as spring starts.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki v2 %}
But I just can’t bring myself to abandon the dream I’ve had since I was young…

So I’d love to play the role of a hero in a tokusatsu show as well, and even appear in an educational program to inspire children.

Thanks to Tenshouin doing the best he can for me, I think I’ll have a good starting point.

Although, I’m not yet capable of expanding myself to accomplish so much, and on top of that, to succeed in every single thing I try.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kaoru v2 %}
It’ll be fine, won’t it? Hard work should be rewarded, right? If people like you can’t make their dreams come true—

If *you* can’t be happy, then people like me are screwed~♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki angry3 %}
What’s that supposed to mean…? What are you going to do after graduation, Hakaze? Did you actually give it any thought?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kaoru v2 %}
Huh~? Sounds like you don’t have faith in me… I’m 100% gonna pursue an idol career. I already managed to convince my parents and brother about it.

My sister is fully supporting me, too.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kaoru frown %}
Thing is though, my family is *extremely* practical~

They told me that if I don’t succeed even after putting in the effort, I should give up on being an idol once and for all.

And then, I should take over the Hakaze family business. I mean, I’m thankful that they have a plan B prepared for me, but…

I didn’t really *ask* for their help… So maybe I feel this way ‘cause I’m in a rebellious phase of some sort…?

I was prepared to be disowned, but it just feels like I’m getting supervised instead…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kaoru awkward %}
Anyways, it’s kinda hard to do things on my own, so I’m hoping Sakuma-san could join me.

I asked him if he’s interested, so we’ll see what happens… It’s his life in the end. I can’t force him.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki grin %}
I see. Well, I’m sure you’ll be just fine. You’re so full of talent that I’m almost jealous.

I mean, if *you* won’t become an idol, who else will? Good luck out there! If you ever need help, you can always count on me.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kaoru v2 %}
Ahaha, you sure act big, huh\~? Well, as fellow graduates, let’s continue to support each other\~
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki idle %}
Speaking of which… You reminded me when you mentioned Sakuma — What do you think Kanata is going to do after graduation…?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kaoru idle %}
Huh? Wait, you don’t know either? I haven’t heard from him, so I was a little worried…

I really thought he would’ve told you something.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki sad3 %}
And <em>I</em> thought that he would have told <em>you</em> all about it… You didn’t hear anything either? Really…?

I wonder if he’s going to be alright… He could just disappear without a trace the moment we graduate.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kaoru frown %}
I can totally see that happening~. …Even though we’d be more than happy to help if he just talked to us.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki frown %}
<em>Honestly</em>… The word “distant” was made for Kanata.[^1]
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata sigh2 %}
…are you two [badmouthing] me~?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki shocked %}
Whoa— You scared me! What’s the matter, Kanata? Why are you crouching down? Do you have a stomachache?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kaoru v2 %}
Ahh~… Since the inside of the fountain has been decorated for Repayment Festival, Kanata-kun can’t have his *puka puka* time, right?

That’s why he’s gazing at the water with an annoyed look on his face, with his hand touching the surface…♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki v2 %}
It’s still chilly out, so I don’t think you should be soaking in the water in the first place… Okay, Kanata? If you miss moisture, we can go to a nearby bathhouse together…♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata frown %}
i do [not] like hot [water]~…

uuu~ how dare they do as they [like] to the [fountain] without *my* [permission]… this is unforgivable.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki v2 %}
But the fountain belongs to the school. They don’t need your permission either way, do they?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kaoru v2 %}
…Hey, Kanata-kun~ Haven’t you told Moricchi about your household?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata thinking2 %}
no, not really~ chiaki is chiaki in the end, so…

i do not think he would [treat] me any differently whether i explained it or not.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata smile2 %}
if that is the case, then i do not want to give him something so [heavy] to bear.

and if he already knows but is [pretending] not to, then i prefer to [respect] that [gentle lie].
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kaoru v2 %}
Huh, I see… You cherish Moricchi a <em>lot</em>, don’t you? ♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata frown2 %}
mm~… i am just protecting him, as he is still a [child]. he cannot do anything without me.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki idle %}
That’s what <em>I</em> should be saying. I was talking with Hakaze earlier about this but — what do you plan to do in the future?

It’s already March, so I’d like to believe you’ve decided on a career path by now…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki grin %}
But if you haven’t, then until the little guys from Ryuseitai catch up with us—

How about you and I temporarily team up as a duo? Like Kamen Rider No.1 and No.2![^2] ♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata smile3 %}
fufu. that is also a wonderful idea. i would have loved to do that…

it is all going to be okay, chiaki, kaoru. i also want to continue living on the [surface] with everyone, so…

i will make sure to get through somehow.

i will fight against my unreasonable [fate], and save my [world]. i am a hero too, after all.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kaoru frown %}
You’re saying it all so vaguely… You just have to make it sound mysterious, huh?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata v2 %}
fufufu. the [ends of the universe] and the [bottom of the ocean] are humankind’s last [frontiers], after all~…♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki idle %}
You’re dodging the topic again… Call for me if you need help, Kanata. Whether it’s at the ends of the universe or at the bottom of the ocean, I’ll always come rushing to your side.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata smile %}
okaaay~ i will gladly call for you. i have not told you this before, but…

i have always been a [huge fan] of you, chiaki.

i will call for you even if i have no [reason] to, so… please come see me, okay? [promise] me, chiaki.
