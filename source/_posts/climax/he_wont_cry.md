{% bubble Subaru %}
Ta~kamin? Why’re you so spaced out? You tired?

Then again, you’re <em>always</em> like that! Ahahahaha! ☆
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori idle %}
………
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Subaru curious %}
…Heyy~? At least answer me! Let’s communicate with each other!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori surprised %}
Fwah? Ohh, sorry, Akehoshi-senpai… I’m always up early, so I get sleepy by this hour…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Subaru %}
Oh~? Are you a li’l kid or something? Ahaha! ☆

I get up early in the morning too, ‘cause I have to walk Daikichi! We’re the same, huh? Isn’t it so nice to share something in common?[^1] ♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori sad %}
Hah… Umm, well, my family owns a greengrocer store, so… They always make me help out every morning with preparation, like lining up the vegetables for sale…

Even when I stay asleep, they just force me to wake up… Though I can’t sleep much either way ‘cause of all the noise downstairs…

We live in the shopping district, so it’s really lively in the morning…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Subaru %}
Oh yeah~ You help out at home, huh? That’s amazing! Lemme praise you! There, there, there~♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori v2 %}
Please don’t pat my head… You’re as insanely touchy-feely as <em>that</em>, aren’t you…?

You’re both so similar, it’s almost like you’re brothers…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Subaru %}
As touchy-feely as “that”…? Ohh, do you mean Chi~chan-senpai? Aww come on, no need to say something so vomit-inducing as that, y’know! ☆
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori worried %}
I didn’t go *that* far!?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Subaru %}
Ahaha. Sometimes I do wish I could be more like Chi~chan-senpai, though. But there’s just no way I could get along with anyone and everyone the same way he does.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori srsthinking %}
I know, right… I mean, he doesn’t even mind connecting with people who don’t really fit in, like you and me…

He’s basically kind to just about anyone, isn’t he…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Subaru angry2 %}
Whoa, you just grouped us together, didn’t you? Into the “zero friends” group! You little rascal\~! Don’t lump me with you\~!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori worried %}
Ehhh…? First you say you’re glad we share something, now you’re annoyed we do…?

I don’t get you… What did you want, anyway…?

I doubt you have any interest in me… I know we’re in the same club, but we haven’t really ever talked to each other, have we…?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Subaru grin %}
Mm\~… That’s ‘cause ever since you came to school, Chi\~chan-senpai’s only had his eyes on you, soo\~

Maaaybe I’m a little jealous or something…♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori curious %}
Huh…? What does that mea—
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki grin %}
Akehoshi! Takamine! What’s up, what’re you guys up to!? Are you sitting around and having a nice chat!? Sounds fun! Make some space for me! ☆
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori surprised %}
Gah!? Hey, watch it… Please don’t jump on me out of nowhere… You almost broke my spine…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Subaru angry2 %}
Yeah! We’re used to it by now, but you’d get arrested if you hugged a stranger out of nowhere, y’know?

Officer~! This man is a pervert!
{% endbubble %}

{% img /img/es/eventstory/climax/wontcry1_2.jpg %}

{% bubble Chiaki grin %}
Heh! ♪ It’s still a little chilly, so you’ll start to feel cold if you don’t move around!

That’s why your senior decided to be considerate and share his warmth with you through a hug! Squeeze, squeeze~☆
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori sigh %}
Actually, it’s *freezing* cold… A farewell party’s fine and all, but why’re we having it outside…?

I feel like it would’ve been better if we had it in a restaurant, or at least inside the gym with the heater on…

Basketball courts are small anyway, so it’s really crowded and suffocating with this many people around…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki grin %}
What’s that? You’re in pain, Takamine!? Alright then, let me perform the lifesaving technique I learned from Kanata! I’ll give you oxygen through mouth-to-mouth…☆
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori surprised %}
Gahhh!? Get your face away from me, you weirdo! I’ll seriously call the police…!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Subaru curious %}
You haven’t been drinking or anything, have you, Chi~chan-senpai?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki grin %}
Nope! I’m underage! I think I’m just getting a little too excited!

Ahh, I can’t control myself! I feel like hugging and kissing every single person I see!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori v2 %}
You better cut it out soon, or I’ll tie you up with rope…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki grin %}
Oh, that sounds like the perfect hero crisis! I’m intrigued! But I’d rather you refrain from doing that for now!

For you see, as a final parting, we’re having a match between the graduates and underclassmen!

We’re on a basketball court, after all! Doing nothing but eating snacks and chatting would be a little too sad, right?

This is the *Basketball* Club’s farewell party, so let’s play basketball!

Fuhaha! You guys should also change into your uniforms and join us! Let’s have a final showdown! Come on now, let me feel your growth firsthand…☆
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori sad2 %}
Mm~… Sounds tiring, so I’ll pass…

I’m annoyed enough that you dragged me here when I’m not even the type to go to parties…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Subaru %}
Oh, sure. I’m in!

Heh… I’m gonna give you a good beating as payback for everything you put me through the past two years… Chi\~chan-senpai\~♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki grin %}
Ooh, I’m excited to see you try! I won’t be beaten by a fledgling so easily, Akehoshi! ♪

You should join us, Takamine. I’d be happy if you could at least cheer me on.

This might be the last time you see me in a basketball uniform in all my glory, y’know? Make sure you burn it straight into your very eyes! Fuhahaha! ☆
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori frown %}
Ehhh… I feel like if *that* was burned into my retinas, I’d never be able to get a good night’s sleep again…

<th>(It’s tiring… I feel exhausted just watching people play…)</th>
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori frown %}
<th>(As tiring as it is to have so many people in the club, it ended up being in my favor this time, ‘cause I barely got a chance to do anything…)</th>

<th>(Everyone wanted to have a final match with Morisawa-senpai, I guess…)</th>

<th>(All the underclassmen are fond of him, after all… The only ones who rebelled were me and Akehoshi-senpai…)</th>

<th>(Maybe I should’ve been a little nicer to him before everything was over…)</th>

<th>(But I dunno, even that feels waaay too late… I should leave that to the juniors who were always attached to him, in that “I love Morisawa-senpai! ♪” way…)</th>

<th>(Considering we share the same club and unit, and all… Man, why did he get so involved with me, anyway…?)</th>

<th>(Meh, anyway… I was expecting something way more sad for the farewell party, but…)</th>

{% bubble Midori srsthinking %}
<th>(Morisawa-senpai was also laughing the whole time…)</th>

<th>(I thought he was gonna make us all cry with a big speech retelling our past memories or something…)</th>

<th>(But in the end, nobody shed a single tear — everyone was just laughing until their whole bodies hurt… It didn’t really feel satisfying somehow…)</th>

<th>(Well, it’s not like we’re parting by death or anything, so I guess this is how it goes…?)</th>
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori worried %}

<th>(Is the club having some kind of after-party…? I bet they still don’t wanna part ways… Man, they’re so energetic…)</th>

<th>(Wait, no, it’s too quiet for that… Weird, did they just forget to turn off the lights…?)</th>

<th>(Uuu~ It’s so hard for me to shake off these kinda thoughts… Maybe I’ll grab my bag quickly, and then take a quick look on my way home…)</th>

## Chapter 3

{% bubble Chiaki smileconfident %}
…Hmm? Ohh, that surprised me!

So it was you, Takamine! What’s up, what’s wrong!? Are you on your way home?

You shouldn’t stay around for so long, y’know! Go back home, brush your teeth, and go to bed!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori worried %}
Ah—… Um, no, I just left my bag in the classroom, so…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori srsthinking %}
<th>(Huh…? I guess Morisawa-senpai wasn’t crying after all…?)</th>

<th>(He’s got that usual dumb-looking smile on his face… Ah wait, but there’s traces of tears around his eyes…)</th>

<th>(Did he just stop himself from crying and force a smile in the short time he noticed me and turned around…?)</th>
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori frown %}
<th>(You’re *always* like this.)</th>
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki grin %}
What’s the matter? You don’t seem well! Are you sleepy? Sorry for keeping you up late for the farewell party!

Ah, I remember now! Weren’t you always too scared to walk alone at night? Alrighty then, let me take you back home!

Wait for me, I’ll be ready soon!

Heh! ♪ Just to let you know, I was cleaning the gym as thanks for all the wonderful memories it gave me the past three years!

Showing our gratitude is important, Takamine! Both as a hero and an idol!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori curious %}
Morisawa-senpai.

……Is everything alright?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki grin %}
Hm? Is what alright? I don’t know what you’re referring to, but worry not, Takamine! My engines are always at full throttle for the sake of protecting the peace of the world!

Fuhahaha…!! ☆
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori sad %}
…I see.

<th>(Ahh… I wonder why I feel this way…? Morisawa-senpai hasn’t even done anything wrong…)</th>

<th>(But seeing that smile of his irritates me to no end for some reason…)</th>
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori idle %}
<th>(Morisawa-senpai, why’re you smiling…? You, who loves everyone and is loved by everyone in return… How can you even be smiling right now…?)</th>

<th>(Graduation is supposed to be something upsetting, so agonizingly lonely and sad…)</th>

<th>(Yet… Are you really gonna try and look cool while parting ways, until the very end…?)</th>

<th>(No… Even before all this, you’ve always been—…)</th>
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki curious %}
Takamine? Heeey, what’s wrong? You look like you’re feeling down…? You’re a handsome guy, so seeing you all silent and blank-faced is terrifying!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori sad4 %}
No, not really… I’m just a little tired, sleepy, and irritated…

………
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mao %}
Heeey, Subaru! I’m guessing the farewell party’s over by now?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mao sigh %}
Sorry! I really wanted to join, but I had a ton of Student Council work to do~!

You know how the Repayment Festival is in two weeks? And how unit activities’ll mainly be done by the second-year students starting with that festival, yeah?

Since everyone’s so new to this, there’s been a lotta trouble, and I’ve been busy dealing with it.

And to top it off, both the president and vice president are seriously thorough when it comes to these things…

So now I’ve been handed over all the tasks, and have been entrusted with full authority. They won’t even give me any advice!

It’s like, completely up to us underclassmen now. I feel like we have a very bleak future ahead of us at this rate, but I’d like to adapt to it somehow as soon as possible.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Subaru %}
Ahaha, wow, Sally~ It’s not every day I see you complain, huh?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mao %}
Lemme vent a little~ I have to act like the big guy now, as the next Student Council President…

So I’m always presenting myself as a proper leader and stuff when I’m at the Student Council office.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mao frown %}
If the boss complains, the subordinates are just gonna get anxious, right?

So, I’ve been holding it back and working through everything as fast as I can, but I guess a lotta those worries started building up inside me.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Subaru %}
Ohh~ Seems rough for you. There, there, let me pat your head~♪

Ahaha, it sounds busy at the Student Council, too. Good work out there!

Trickstar’s a unit of only second-year students, so nothing’s really changed for us. It’s pretty peaceful actually.

But the other units are bustling with stuff they need to get done, huh?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Subaru frown %}
Like, I wonder what Ryuseitai’s gonna do, since they won’t be able to say their signature line, “The five of us together~” anymore.

And like, today… From what I could tell, Chi~chan-senpai and Takamin were both acting a little off.

So since I was kinda worried, I tried my best to talk to them, but…

I’m just not good at that sorta stuff. I’m impressed that Chi\~chan-senpai can do it so easily. And you too, Sally\~♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mao %}
Haha, it’s fun taking care of people. At the same time though, the more attached you get, the harder it is to say goodbye.

It gets unbearably gloomy around this time, and it sucks.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Subaru %}
Yeah. But well, we can’t stop the clock, can we… The least we can do is part ways properly—

And to say goodbye with a smile, so that our seniors won’t have any regrets when they leave.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Subaru frown %}
It’s pretty hard to do it right, though~ Takamin is terrible at smiling, for one thing.

On the other hand, Chi~chan-senpai’s smiling a lot more than he used to last year. …Aren’t those two kiiinda similar?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mao %}
Really? I personally think they’re the exact opposite… What kinda world do you have to be in to perceive it that way~?

Well anyways, it’s pretty late by now, so let’s go home.

We were supposed to hand gifts to our seniors in the club today… Since we promised we’d buy them together.

But I’ve been so busy that even *that* got delayed… I feel really bad.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Subaru %}
It’s fine, really! As long as we make it before they graduate.

This wouldn’t have been the right timing for emotional graduation gifts anyway…

It was pretty much the usual fooling around we do in the club… It’s almost hard to believe that even *that* will no longer be the usual for us soon.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Subaru awkward %}
Hey Sally~, graduation really does suck… Even *I* have to push myself to smile all the time.

## Translation Notes
[^1]: “I’m so happy/It’s so nice to share something in common” is a typical phrase Chiaki says to others.
