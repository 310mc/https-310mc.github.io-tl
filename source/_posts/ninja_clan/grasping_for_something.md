## Chapter 1

<div class="msr-location">
    <p><span><b>Location:</b> Classroom 2-A</span></p>
</div>

{% bubble Tetora serious %}
Uumyu… I had no idea somethin’ so serious was happening while we were just sitting here, messing around playing a game.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shinobu sad %}
Uu… <em>Sniffs</em>, I can’t believe he’d ask such an unreasonable request from me in such a short time… It’s awful.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora serious %}
Don’t look at it that way. You can’t give up before trying, Shinobu-kun!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shinobu frown %}
What’re you on about!? You know all too well how it’s been for me, don’t you? I haven’t been able to get a single club member no matter how many times I’ve tried promoting it!

I’ve participated in a joint live to present a great track record in the club, as well as trained in noticeable areas to catch people’s attention—

I made posters advertising the club as a friendly place to be in, and I even had Midori-kun help me take a club introduction video showcasing ninja arts—[^1]

I’ve done every single idea I could think of, and it still wasn’t enough~!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori northinking %}
Video… Oh yeah, we did do something like that, huh?

That legendary video was super popular in the club presentation, but it still didn’t get you any new members…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shinobu frown %}
It had no impact as a video showcasing ninja arts, either… People these days are too used to video-streaming websites…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori smile %}
Yeah, nowadays there are hundreds of videos trying to one-up each other to be the next viral thing.

You got a lot of people asking for photos and autographs after that, right?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shinobu frown %}
I’m not some viral streamer!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori smile %}
Why not try making a channel, though? It’ll promote your club, and if you get popular, you’ll make lots of money.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shinobu worried %}
I want club members, not money~!

<em>Sigh</em>… I’ve lost hope after so many attempts…

The only thing I can do now is watch helplessly as my precious Ninja Association fades into dust…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora angry %}
No! It’s too late to give up!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shinobu worried %}
Huh?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora v2 %}
Aight, change of plans! Our meeting’s gonna be about how to save the Ninja Association!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shinobu surprised0 %}
Huh? Huh!? A-Are you sure…!? But I’ll be taking away your time…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora v2 %}
Oh c’mon now, Shinobu-kun! There’s no need to hold back with us!

And didn’t I tell ya before?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shinobu worried %}
Huh? What?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora v2 %}
Dontcha remember? When you mentioned you wanted more club members, I told you that I’d do anythin’ for you in order to make that happen, since we’re so indebted to you.[^2]

You’re fine with that, right, Midori-kun?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori smile %}
Mhm, sure. We have time before our on-campus live show, so we don’t *have* to sort it out by today.
{% endbubble %}

{% img /img/es/eventstory/ninjaclan/tetoraorigcg.jpg %}

{% bubble Tetora v2 %}
Yeah, and besides! If one person can’t think up somethin’ on their own, then with three people we’ll have three heads to brainstorm with—

Which means we’ll be three times smarter!

We’ll be invincible together! We’ll turn as smart as a supercomputer, and come up with somethin’ good, don’tchu worry!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori sigh %}
This is already sounding brainless, though… Also, I don’t think that’s what a supercomputer does…

Like, are you imagining it like a handy cat robot who can do anything or something…?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora v2 %}
Huh? Am I wrong? I thought they were like, super duper intelligent computers or somethin’.

Anyway, the details don’t matter! The point is, we’ll make it through with the three of us!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shinobu awkward %}
Tetora-kun, Midori-kun… Thank you so much…!
{% endbubble %}

<div class="msr-narration">
    <p>Time passes…</p>
</div>

{% bubble Midori northinking %}
Ermm… So according to Isara-senpai, he’ll work it out for you somehow as long as you get at least one club member?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora v2 %}
Yep, so we just need to think up a way to make someone join.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shinobu curious %}
Umm…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora v2 %}
Mhm, go ahead and speak your mind, Shinobu-kun!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shinobu curious %}
If only one person is enough, then wouldn’t enlisting either of you in my club do the trick?

I would prefer to perform activities with a new member, but this is a dire situation, so I don’t mind either of you acting as a ghost member, since you already have your own clubs.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori sweat %}
Ehhh… I don’t think you should do that…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shinobu curious %}
Huh? Why not? I thought it would be the fastest way to solve this issue…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori serious %}
They’re gonna instantly be able to tell that we aren’t doing any activities in your club.

Sure, your club would be saved for <em>now</em>… But wouldn’t you fall into the same problem again down the line?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora serious %}
Yeah, and we shouldn’t cheat the system. You might get harsher treatment for it, like stricter inspections.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shinobu northinking %}
Mmm, I would not want that happening. I would only throw even more trouble on Isara-dono…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora serious %}
Yeah, so let’s just figure out a way to get you a new member!
{% endbubble %}

## Chapter 2

{% bubble Shinobu frown %}
While I understand the solution, I’m not sure where we could even start…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori northinking %}
Hmm… Ah—Why not invite one of the Ryuseitai-N newbies? If they’ve joined our unit, surely they’d wanna join in on your activities, too?

This doesn’t sound so hard to solve after all~♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shinobu sad %}
………
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori worried0 %}
Huh? Why’re you making that face? Did I say something wrong?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shinobu frown %}
…I have already attempted such a thing before, back in April. I tried asking each and every one of them, without any luck.

To make matters even worse, my desperate act to invite any of them into the club was sent in as a complaint, that Tetora-kun even had to order me to stop~!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora awkward0 %}
I-I’m sorry ‘bout that. You desperately trynna get them to join was starting to freak ‘em out… I *had* to do somethin’ ‘bout it.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori curious %}
Ehhh, it was *that* bad…? I guess this idea’s a bust, then.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora curious %}
Also, I’m curious. Did you ever have a promotion that succeeded in gathering a huge number of people? I know they didn’t join in the end, but like, the one that got the most amount of people interested?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shinobu sad %}
I did have something like that, but…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori serious %}
Oh, you did? That makes things easier, then. We can just polish that idea up some more to make it into something even better. Is it the one that showcased what kinda activities you do?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shinobu %}
No, I mean Scroll of the Elements, the joint live from last year. Remember when we had a handshake event after the performance?

I was told that I could hand out flyers about my club, so I did as such. That’s when I received many questions and requests from people wanting to observe the club.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora surprised0 %}
Whaaa!? Why didn’t you get someone new from there, then!? That’s such a waste!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shinobu frown %}
Uuu… I was pleasantly surprised to receive so many responses, but…

It was mostly old people who were interested in the Ninja Association, and they could barely walk on their own.

They wouldn’t ever be able to do backflips and other nimble moves.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora serious %}
Oh yeaaah… We did have a lot of old people as guests back then, ‘cuz of the location and theme of the performance.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shinobu frown %}
Mhm, so while I enjoyed chatting with them about ninjas and historical plays over tea, I politely rejected their offer to join.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori sigh %}
To be fair, it wasn’t the right place to do that sorta thing anyway… You need *students* in your club, so why’d you try inviting people over in *that* live show…?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shinobu worried %}
No, I understand that too, I swear!

It was a desperate measure! I was hoping the old people would pass my flyer onto their grandkids or teens in their neighborhood, and that they would spread news of how interesting my club activities were.

However, I sadly miscalculated the part where they would think *they’re* allowed to join the club, too.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori worried0 %}
It’s like a telephone game gone wrong, huh…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shinobu frown %}
I was surprised by it, too…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori serious %}
But I can really tell just how many times you’ve attempted to get new club members. And it still wasn’t enough to get someone…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shinobu frown %}
Exactly… I’m at my wit’s end…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora northinking %}
Hmm… We’re not gonna get anywhere like this, huh? Shinobu-kun, how about you try going back to the basics?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shinobu curious %}
Basics…?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora v2 %}
That's how karate practice works! Once you’re more capable of moving your body in a certain way, you start wanting to practice applying that to new martial arts, right? But you reach your limit pretty fast like that.

That’s when you go back to the fundamental steps! You may notice somethin’ you weren’t able to recognize in the past!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shinobu %}
While that may possibly help, how am I supposed to do that, exactly?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora v2 %}
Basically, you should try to get new members through one of your very first ideas.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shinobu curious %}
…? Ermm, but isn’t the whole problem that I’ve attempted so many things and still haven’t found any success? Wouldn’t the same happen again…?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora v2 %}
Yeah, I know it didn’t work out for you, but…

Rather than repeating the same thing, try and think about *why* it didn’t work out. And then you can improve the idea from there and try it again!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
Ahhh… so basically fix what didn’t work out, and give it another shot?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora v2 %}
Yup! There’s no point doing this in a delicate way. You just gotta pour your passion in and convey the beauty of ninjas to everyone with all you’ve got!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori curious %}
Wow, just what you’d expect from a musclehead… But well, he’s got a point. You’re trying to find someone like minded, so doing it the classic way might work…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shinobu v2 %}
A-Alright…! I’m honestly terrified and have no confidence in this, but… I’ll at least try!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora v2 %}
Yeah, yeah! You got this, Shinobu-kun!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
Actually, wouldn’t it be a good idea to ask our seniors for help, too? The more ideas, the better, right…?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora v2 %}
You’re right! We’ll have more options to choose from that way.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shinobu surprised0 %}
Huh!? But both of them are extremely busy… and I would only feel horrible for dragging them into my personal problem…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora v2 %}
What’re you talking about? They may be idols, but their real job is to be the heroes of justice!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori smile %}
Yep, not to mention, heroes are supposedly the type to come rushing to the rescue for anyone in need.
{% endbubble %}

## Chapter 3

<div class="msr-location">
    <p><span><b>Location:</b> Meeting Room</span></p>
</div>

{% img /img/es/eventstory/ninjaclan/3ch3.jpg %}

<div class="msr-narration">
    <p>Next day…</p>
</div>

{% bubble Tetora curious %}
Shinkai-senpai and Morisawa-senpai are late… Isn’t it about time for our meeting?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shinobu curious %}
Indeed… Did they have a job to deal with all of a sudden?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora northinking %}
Hmm, I think they’d contact us if it was somethin’ like that, though.

Midori-kun, didn’t you send them a message yesterday?

Are we sure the date and time is correct? What if they got the time mixed up…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori v2 %}
I said I did already, didn’t I? And I *did* get the timing right.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora %}
Huh, okay, that’s weird then… What did you even send them, anyway?
{% endbubble %}

{% img /img/es/eventstory/ninjaclan/midoriorigcg.jpg %}

{% bubble Midori smile %}
Ermm… My message was—Ahh, here, this one.

Basically, I said, “I, Eggplant Baron, have taken your Ryusei Yellow as hostage. He’s trembling in fear, waiting for you to rescue him from his worries, eeeggy-eggy-eggplant LOL”

“If you want him back, then make sure you come to ES’s meeting room at 1 PM tomorrow. You better show yourself no matter the cost, or consider your Ryusei Yellow doomed to face his troubles forever.”

“P.S. If you truly can’t make it, then let me know, or ELSE.”
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora surprised0 %}
How will they get what’s going on like <em>that</em>!? Isn’t this basically just spam!?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori smile %}
I figured something like this would work best on those two…♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shinobu frown %}
I feel as though the reason they aren’t here yet is because they didn’t understand the situation based on that message…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori curious %}
Ehh~? Nah, I’m sure it’s fine, they got the gist of it. Hopefully…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora frown %}
You lost your confidence by the end, Midori-kun…
{% endbubble %}

<div class="msr-narration">
    <p>Time passes…</p>
</div>

{% bubble Tetora serious %}
…Fifteen minutes have passed by now, and they’re still not here.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori northinking %}
That’s weird… Wouldn’t you typically come over if you got a message like this? Not me, though.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora serious %}
Yeah, no. I’m telling you, dude, your message just sounded like a prank to them.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori sigh %}
I thought they’d gladly come if I sent it like that, though…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora serious %}
Aight, I’ll have to make a phone call to see what’s goin’ on.

I’ll leave the room for a sec—
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki hidden %}
Fuhahahaha! Fuhaaaahahahahahaha!!! ☆
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata hidden %}
fufufu, fufufufufufu~♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora curious %}
Hm?
{% endbubble %}

{% img /img/es/eventstory/ninjaclan/3ch3_1.jpg %}

{% bubble Chiaki v2 %}
Heroes always arrive in the nick of time! The wind howls, the sky rages — Ryusei Red!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata v2 %}
the water dances, the waves jump — ryusei blue~☆
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shinobu %}
Ah! Those catchphrases are from Hurricaneger!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori sweat %}
They said it so confidently, but I can barely see them posing in the hallway from here…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki v2 %}
Heh! ♪ Typically I’d go for my Ryuseitai catchphrase, but I came here with Kanata only, so! We went for something that specifically matches Ryusei Yellow’s interests![^3]

Though, it feels sloppily-done with the two of us alone… and we’re still wearing our civilian clothes.

We should definitely be doing this with the proper set-up. Sorry to ask this, but could we change our clothes first and start over?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori v2 %}
…Enough, just get in already.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata v2 %}
yes, let’s do so, chiaki~ we [cannot] keep them waiting any longer.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki v2 %}
Hm, good point… Right now, we should focus on talking to our juniors above all else!

Alright, so! What’s wrong, Sengoku!? There’s something troubling you, right? You can consult us all you like!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shinobu surprised0 %}
Huh!? You were able to figure out why we asked you to come here through that fishy message alone!? I’m surprised.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki v2 %}
Hmm? Ahh—well, it wasn’t entirely clear, but…

Worry not! It made enough sense to me! ☆
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata v2 %}
fufu, i understood it, too\~ i thought it suited us very well\~♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori smile %}
You see? I told you it’d work perfectly on them.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora frown %}
Don’t look so smug ‘bout it… You wouldn’t typically understand a message like that, so make sure to type it up properly next time, ‘kay?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki surprised0 %}
Ah, wait, that reminds me! The message was one thing, but you *really* didn’t need to attach a photo of an entire box of eggplants after it!

Why did you go with an eggplant baron!? Weren’t there plenty of other options among all the vegetables!?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori serious %}
Huh? Didn’t you always say that the stronger the enemy, the better? So I chose something powerful enough for you to struggle with.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki frustrated %}
Gghh!? That isn’t how I expected my words to be interpreted…!

But it *is* true that I struggled to hold back from blocking you on sight, even when I knew it was you behind the message…!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori v2 %}
Ex<em>cuse</em> me!? You’ve got some *nerve* to complain about our high quality eggplants… How about I send you a box for yourself, huh?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki worried %}
I-I don’t want it! I really, really don’t!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori smile %}
There’s no need to hold back…♪ I’m indebted to you time and time again, so it’ll be like a summer gift.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki worried %}
I-I’m not holding back anything, though…? While I’m grateful to receive a repayment gift from my junior, I quite honestly would rather you refrain from sending me a box!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora awkward0 %}
Aight, aight, let’s stop here! This is just ‘bout eggplants now. We’re supposed to talk ‘bout Shinobu-kun’s concerns today!

But I *am* glad to hear you understood the message, despite how fishy it sounded. I thought you’d brush it off as a prank at first.

I was actually just ‘bout to call you guys, in case you really weren’t coming.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki awkward %}
Sorry about that. I assure you we were trying our best to finish our work as soon as possible to get here.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shinobu worried %}
Huh!? You two really *were* busy after all… I deeply apologize for asking you to come here despite that…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata v2 %}
fufufu~ there is no need to worry about that, shinobu.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki v2 %}
Exactly! Our jobs are important, but what’s even more so is rushing to the rescue when our comrades are in a predicament~☆

Now then, feel free to speak to us!
