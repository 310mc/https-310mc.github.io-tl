Ooh, this village really brings back a lot of memories for me. The last time I was here was for the Scroll of the Elements performance.

We still have time before the live show, so how about we go around the place for now?

Oh! There's a samurai walking about! It's like we've been taken back to the era itself~♪

            I think I'd have fun acting as a samurai sheathing a katana, punishing the wicked and protecting the weak!

            I had a lot of fun going around the place during Scroll of the elements! Oh, and I remember how flashy Kanata's ninjutsu was.

            The most exciting performance was when Sengoku jumped through a ring of fire. I remember the cheers like it was yesterday!

            Yeah, me too. You prepared a lot for us today, after all!

            We had to practice for this performance alongside the one for MDM, but we all worked hard for it, so I'm sure it'll go well!

Mhm! Does the outfit look okay like this, Producer!?

It's light and durable, and it even glows! It's fun to wear~♪

This surely must've costed a lot of time and money to make… Did it?

            Mmm, your "alright" doesn't always equate to that, though…

            Don't overwork yourself, okay? Everyone, including me, would worry sick if you crashed down.

Alright, the performance is starting soon. But before that, I'd like to express my gratitude, Producer.

Thank you so much for doing everything in your power for Sengoku's sake. Sengoku tends to repress his emotions subconsciously, likely because the time when there was nobody who accepted him for his interests, but…

I can tell he's enjoying himself a lot right now. I'm so glad you were here for him.

            Heheh, I'm happy to hear you say that. Takamine, Nagumo, and Kanata all did their very best to make through the harsh practice—all for Sengoku's sake.

            I'm so glad everyone in Ryuseitai was here for him. I really, really am.
