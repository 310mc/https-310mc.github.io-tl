Uumyu… How the heck did our seniors understand what they needed to do through "eggy-eggplant" alone?

Maybe I'm the weirdo here… I do need to keep my common sense in check at all times, to be fair…

No, no! It can't be *me* who's weird here~!

            Huh? You know 'bout it, Anego?

            Midori-kun sent a fishy message to Morisawa-senpai, but he managed to understand it just fine, and I don't get how…

{% bubble Tetora %}
Huh? You helped Midori-kun out with packing up eggplants in a box?

Ahaha, he *seriously* sent Morisawa-senpai eggplants? I thought that was a joke…

Ryuseitai was able to meet up together after so long, and we had a li'l discussion 'bout eggplants.

            I dunno… I haven't heard anything 'bout it.

            Ohh, you made it into mapo eggplant? I bet spicy mapo would be great to have in this weather~♪

            The main reason we gathered was to talk 'bout Shinobu-kun's worries.

            Huh, you already know 'bout how the Ninja Association might disband? Ohh… So Shinobu-kun told you himself.

But maaan, the Student Council must seriously be driven to a corner if they're actually planning to disband the Ninja Association…

Shinobu-kun worked sooo hard for his club all this time…

I know exactly how much heart and soul he put into it, so I wanna do whatever I can for him.

            You're right! We performed with Akatsuki back then.

            I remember when Kanzaki-senpai brought his horse, Saigoudon. That was a real surprise!

            Oh yeaaah, something like that happened, right?

            Midori-kun told me 'bout it. Shinobu-kun got super excited by the thought of finally finding a real ninja scroll, yeah?

            Oh yeah, that was part of his training. He used to practice the Cloning Jutsu and the Invisibility Jutsu, too.

            I think he used to do a Channeling Jutsu, too, but I don't really remember what he was trying to channel, exactly…? Do you remember, Anego?
