Producer! I'm so glad I found you, I was looking for you!

T-The truth is… there was a box in front of my dorm room yesterday…

On it said "to Morisawa-senpai", and… the name of *that*…

            Um, you know, the… Ugh! Find the courage within you, Morisawa Chiaki…!

            Y-Yeah… Exactly, I received eggplants…

            I can only think of one person who'd do this, but I didn't expect him to *actually* send me a box…

{% bubble Chiaki frown %}
Someone could trip if I left the box in the hallway, so I shoved it inside my dorm for the time being, but… I can't get the courage to open it up.

I'd honestly rather avoid seeing or touching it altogether, but…

It'll just rot if I leave it as it is…

            {% bubble Chiaki frown %}
            Good idea… There's a couple of people who cook in the dorm's kitchen often, so maybe I could hand it to them, instead.

            But that means carrying the box… Ughhh, so I can't avoid touching *that*, can I…

            Yeah, you're right… I shouldn't waste all the farmers' effort in growing these.

            I need to think up a way to get rid of them before they rot, or I'll feel bad…

Well, either way, thank you for hearing me out.

I'll do something about the box by today. I have to just see it this way: This is actually my *lucky* day!

Heroes grow stronger the more powerful the adversary! I'll make sure to overcome this obstacle, no matter what it takes!<!--強い困難に立ち向かうほど成長する-->
