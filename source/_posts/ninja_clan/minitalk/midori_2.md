I'm so sorry for making you help me with packing in the eggplants.

I'm going to be sending this box of eggplants to Morisawa-senpai.

I sent him this type of urgent message the other day, but he arrived late to our meeting anyway. So this is going to be his punishment.

            Yeah, it's as it says: eeeggy-eggy-eggyplant. It's Eggplant Baron, after all.

            Oh, yeah—Could you draw me a picture of Eggplant Baron, Anzu-san? It'd help boost my spirits.

            Well, it'd definitely work as one for Morisawa-senpai.

            But I heard heroes grow stronger the more powerful the adversary, so maybe he'll tear up with joy for the opportunity.<!--強い困難に立ち向かうほど成長するそうですし、むしろ泣いて喜ぶんじゃないですかね-->

            Hehe, aren't they? I chose the absolute best we had in our greengrocer.

            You can tell how fresh it is from the smooth and silky feel, and the green calyx is clearly in good shape\~ I can guarantee its tastiness\~♪

{% bubble Midori %}
Whew. I packed a lot inside, so it's heavier than expected…

I'm sorry to ask this of you, but could you please press the button on the elevator for me? My hands are tied carrying this box.

I'm gonna carry this over to Starmony Dorm, so I'd like to go to the lobby.

            No, please don't worry about it. I'm delivering this many vegetables all the time, so I'm used to it.

            Plus, I'd get scolded if I make you of all people carry this for me…

            Hmm… But we'll reach the lobby pretty quickly, won't we…?

{% bubble Midori smile %}
Alright, we'll have to part ways here. Thank you for your hard work, Anzu-san.

I'll be placing this box in front of Morisawa-senpai's room. I'm excited to see how he'll react…♪

Oh, and this eggplant is for you. It's my thanks for helping me out, so please take it.

            Don't worry about it~♪ I can guarantee its quality, so please eat it while it's still fresh.

            You'd definitely enjoy them fried or in a vegetable stew. Oh, I also recommend mapo eggplant.

            Hmmm… I wrote "Eggplants" in huge letters on the box, so… He'll likely jump the moment he sees the box, for starters.

            He may not even try opening it… But, well, I'll see what I'll do when that happens.
