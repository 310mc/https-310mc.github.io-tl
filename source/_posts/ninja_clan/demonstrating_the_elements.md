## Chapter 1

{% note location %}
**Location:** Garden Terrace
{% endnote %}

{% img /img/es/eventstory/ninjaclan/5ch1.jpg %}

{% note narration %}
**Time:** Next day
{% endnote %}

{% bubble Tetora v2 %}
Aight, show us the outfits you’ve designed, Shinobu-kun!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
What style did you go with…?
{% endbubble %}

{% img /img/es/eventstory/ninjaclan/5ch1_1.jpg %}

{% bubble Shinobu v2 %}
Uuu… I need to show it now…?

I rarely ever design outfits, so it’s a little embarrassing…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora v2 %}
There’s nothing to be ashamed of! C’mon, it’s better to make use of your time and show us now instead of being embarrassed!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shinobu v2 %}
V-Very well, then… Here goes nothing! Tadah\~! This is what I came up with\~☆
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora v2 %}
Ohhh~! This is pretty neat, actually! I can easily tell what the concept is based on.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori smile %}
Mhm, it looks good. It’s so cute…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora v2 %}
Huh? *Cute?*

Ah—! You’re talking 'bout the frog doodle next to the outfit, arentcha?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori smile %}
Mhm, it’s so cute. Shinobu-kun, can I tear that part out and have it for myself…?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shinobu v2 %}
Oh! You like my partners Peachy and Thunder? Then allow me to draw you something more refined instead of this simple sketch later!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori smile %}
Huh!? You sure!? Yaaay~♪ Promise me, okay?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora v2 %}
Heeey! We’re already getting off-topic! We need to finalize the modern ninja outfit by today, okay?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
Ah, you’re right. Sorry. I lost track ‘cause of the cute frog…

Umm… I think this design looks pretty good, but maybe it still has the classic ninja style…?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora v2 %}
Hmm… Good point. How ‘bout you make the main part of the outfit more like a sporty ninja attire? It could be a jacket or somethin’ instead.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shinobu v2 %}
—!! That’s a great idea! It’d look so stylish!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori worried %}
Ehhh…? Where the heck did that advice come from…?

I thought you had no interest in fashion like me…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora v2 %}
Nah, I really don’t have any interest in it either, but my roommate Narukami-senpai is pretty fashionable, so she gives me advice 'bout a lotta things. That’s why I know a bit 'bout this stuff.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori sigh %}
Whaa…? Don’t just leave me all on my own…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shinobu v2 %}
Tetora-kun, Midori-kun, I tried changing the design based on that idea; what do you think?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
Ah, it looks good. It really feels more modern now.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shinobu v2 %}
Hmm… But now that I’ve adjusted the clothes, the shoes and such need to match with it, too… Like… this… Maybe?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora v2 %}
Looks awesome! Let’s fix up the decorations on the outfit itself, too!
{% endbubble %}

{% note narration %}
Time passes
{% endnote %}

{% bubble Shinobu v2 %}
—Whew! This should do it.

Hm…? I feel like someone greeted me just now…?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora v2 %}
Ahh, Anzu Anego! Wassup~!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
Good afternoon. Ahh, you’re asking if this is an outfit design? Yeah, it is.

Huh? Um, the reason we’re working on it is ‘cause—
{% endbubble %}

{% note narration %}
Time passes
{% endnote %}

{% bubble Shinobu v2 %}
—and so, I’d like to combine ninjas with the current age, in order to promote the Ninja Association.

That’s why we were thinking up a modern ninja outfit together.

Huh? It sounds interesting?

Ehehe~ I have more confidence in the idea now that I heard that from you, since you’re a wonderful ES producer! ♪

What will we do with this outfit? Hmm… I haven’t decided what to do yet, actually.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
Yeah, hmm… This doesn’t have anything to do with on-campus jobs, since it’s club-related… and we can’t ask our agency if there’s a job we can do for school club activities…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora v2 %}
There’s not much we can do, so we’re stuck in a rut.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shinobu v2 %}
Huh? You may have a good idea for combining ninjas with the modern era…? Really!?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
What would that be…?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shinobu v2 %}
Hm, hm… Ermm, so there’s a trial session booked for a live show that utilizes AR over at ES?

And you’d like us to do this project with it?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora v2 %}
Oh hey, that’s pretty cool. Isn’t AR like, a super awesome thing?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shinobu v2 %}
T-This is the best thing I could ever ask for…! Are you *sure* you’re alright with our project being used for it!?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora v2 %}
Then let’s make this project even better now while taking that into account!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
Huh? You’ll help us sort this all out later?

Ooh, isn’t that nice, Shinobu-kun? We should be able to do way more if Anzu-san helps us out.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shinobu v2 %}
Really\~!? I’ll think up lots and lots of ideas, then\~!
{% endbubble %}

## Chapter 2

{% note cw %}
**Content Warning:** Brief mentions of stalking.
{% endnote %}

{% note location %}
**Location:** Historical Village
{% endnote %}

{% img /img/es/eventstory/ninjaclan/5ch2.jpg %}

{% note narration %}
**Time:** Day of the performance
{% endnote %}

{% bubble Chiaki v2 %}
Heeey, Anzu!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata v2 %}
we’re over here~

…? what’s wrong? you seem surprised.

yes, exactly~ i was able to come on time without any detours~♪ is it really that unexpected?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki worried %}
Hold on, Kanata. That’s only because I happened to stop you in time before you dipped in the pond, and brought you over here.

You would’ve definitely taken that detour had I not found you.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata pout %}
hmph! you’re so boring, chiaki. anzu-san is praising me for being early for once; can’t you let me have this moment?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki awkward %}
I don’t think there’s any merit from being complimented for this, though… Plus, you shouldn’t soak in water in a public place. You’ll startle the customers.

Oh, speaking of—Thank you so much for helping out Sengoku, Anzu!

I never expected that we’d get another chance to perform here![^1] And it’s even an official job from ES!

Mhm, I’ve heard that this is to experiment with AR live shows. I’m super excited to see what it’ll look like! ☆
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata v2 %}
if we succeed with this experiment, we’ll be able to perform so many other things~ i’d love to have a live show within the ocean. *puka, puka~♪*
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki v2 %}
That sounds interesting! Plus, we’re a flashy action unit, so we should be compatible with this trial.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata v2 %}
hm? ahh, you’re right, anzu-san~ the three of them are late, aren’t they?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki v2 %}
Hmm… Takamine’s likely rooted in front of the souvenir shop in the village.

Remember when we struggled to get him out of there after we were done with Scroll of the Elements?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata v2 %}
oh, i remember~ there are so many of midori’s beloved mascots in there, after all.
{% endbubble %}

{% note narration %}
Screen fades to another place in the area
{% endnote %}

{% bubble Shinobu v2 %}
Yaaay! ♪ This village really is so much fun to be in~!

I arrived here much earlier than the appointed time, so I went around the place to check things out—

And I just couldn’t hold back my excitement from being here! It’s like I went back in time to my favorite era!

Mhm, it feels like my wings are being spread for the first time in a while~♪

<th>(We had recently been practicing for both the MDM[^2] and the Ninja Clan live show…)</th>

<th>(And now we’ve finally gotten through MDM, which was a very important event… so perhaps it’s also because I’ve loosened up a little?)</th>

<th>(—Ah! I shouldn’t relax too much. We’ll have our live show soon. I’ll leave that for after the performance is over!)</th>

Alright then! I’m going to do my absolute best to make people recognize the charm of ninjas today\~! Hip hip hurray\~! ☆

—Hm? The two people standing in front of that store are… Midori-kun and Tetora-kun?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora frown %}
Midori-kun, it’s about time we go meet the others, y’know! We gotta get going fast!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori angry %}
…Shh. Be quiet, Tetora-kun. I’m trying to decide between which Hanzou-mon[^3] plushie I should buy.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora curious %}
Decide between them…? Aren’t they the same?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori smile %}
No, they’re not! Look at them more closely! This one is kinda baby-faced, and this one is smaller and round, right? They’re so cute!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora v2 %}
…Erm, they look the same to me…?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shinobu v2 %}
Tetora-kun, Midori-kun, you were both here already?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora v2 %}
Ah, Shinobu-kun! Wassup~!

Were you about to head to the meeting spot, too?

I met Midori-kun at the entrance, so we were gonna head over together… But then he stopped in his tracks at this souvenir shop.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
Ermm… Which one should I go with…? I can’t decide…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora v2 %}
How about you decide on one after we finish with our live show? You’re just gonna keep on going at this rate.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
Yeah, I guess I’ll do that… I’ll keep thinking about which to take home with me.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shinobu curious %}
I agree with Tetora-kun! If you’re still indecisive, you could go with the one that truly feels right f—Hm?

……<em><th>(staring)</th></em>
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora v2 %}
What’s up, Shinobu-kun?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shinobu thinking %}
Hmm, I felt a gaze on me again…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
Again? You’ve been saying that a lot these past few days.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shinobu v2 %}
Indeed. But there’s nobody around, so it must truly just be my imagination. I’m sure I’ve gotten a bit more sensitive to my surroundings, that’s all.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora worried %}
I can understand feeling that way once or twice, but you’ve felt this way a bunch of times by now… You sure it isn’t something serious? Like a stalker or something…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shinobu v2 %}
Ahahaha, no way! Nobody would get anything out of trailing after me!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori worried %}
Huuhh…? I don’t think that’s the problem here…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shinobu v2 %}
I’ll be alright! That aside, we should hurry over to the appointed meeting place~ We can’t keep our seniors waiting!
{% endbubble %}

## Chapter 3

{% note location %}
**Location:** Ninja Clan Stage
{% endnote %}

{% img /img/es/eventstory/ninjaclan/5ch3.jpg %}

{% note narration %}
**Time:** Before the performance
{% endnote %}

{% bubble Tetora v2 %}
It’s ‘bout time for the performance. I can hear a lotta noise from the audience! Is it alright if I take a peek or two~?

Let’s see what’s goin’ on… Gotta be discreet…

—! Shinobu-kun, look over here! We’ve got a full house! And the stage looks awesome! It’s a whole other league when ES is involved with the implementation, huh~

We specifically invited students from our academy to watch this time around, so we should be able to promote ninjas to people who’d be interested in joining the Ninja Associati—
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shinobu sad %}
………
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora v2 %}
Huh? You were so energetic just a sec ago, what happened? You don’t look so good.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shinobu sad %}
………
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora worried %}
Umm, Shinobu-kun? Are you okay…?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
Ahh, I think he got nervous when he realized this stage will make it or break it for the Ninja Association.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora awkward %}
Well, I almost wanna say there’s no point in being nervous, but is he going to be okay…? We’re gonna be performing real soon.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
I don’t think we’ll make it through if he doesn’t loosen up anytime soon…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora v2 %}
Hm? You’re actually doing pretty okay, huh, Midori-kun? You’re usually the one who’s super nervous before a live show.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori smile %}
Oh, yeah, it’s ‘cause everyone’s gonna be wearing goggles for the AR live show.

I usually get nervous feeling everyone’s eyes on me, but knowing everyone has goggles on helps reduce the anxiety.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki v2 %}
Alright, it’s about time we head out! Are you all ready!?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shinobu surprised %}
Y-Y-Y-Yes!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki worried %}
Urmm… Are you going to be alright, Sengoku?

You’re the center of this performance, and we’ll be performing a lot of action moves—

So I’m not sure if we’ll be able to support you properly if you freeze in place midway…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shinobu worried %}
I-I-I-I’ll b-b-be okay…! I’ll make sure to exhibit my prowess in this live show…! In this very live show~!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki awkward %}
U-Uh-huh. Are you sure you’re okay? You’re shaking…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata v2 %}
shinobu, peace\~☆ come on, do it with me, peace\~☆
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shinobu worried %}
…? L-Like this? Peace…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata v2 %}
yes, now bring your hand down here… okay everyone, do a peace sign with me, and then connect your hands together like this.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki v2 %}
Alright, then… Like this?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora v2 %}
Uhh? This good?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
Umm… do you mean like this? —Hm? Is this… a star shape?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata v2 %}
exactly. fufufu~ it’s like a starfish, how cute.

shinobu, this is ryuseitai~ every corner represents one of your comrades.

so take a deep breath and relax, relaaax~♪ remember, you won’t be standing on stage all on your own.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shinobu v2 %}
Shinkai-dono…

I’m not alone——…

Mhm! I’m alright now!

I’ll absolutely make sure to demonstrate my prowess in this live show!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata v2 %}
yes, that’s the spirit~♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki v2 %}
Aaalrighty then! It’s time to commence our “Ninja Association Promotion” mission! Let’s go!
{% endbubble %}

{% note narration %}
Scene change to the front stage
{% endnote %}

{% bubble Shinobu v2 %}
“♪\~♪\~♪”
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora v2 %}
<th>(Ohh~! He’s like an entirely different person now! He’s super light on his feet!)</th>

<th>(Shinobu-kun’s action moves really are the coolest out of everyone!)</th>
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori smile %}
*<th>(whispering)</th>* Shinobu-kun looks more relaxed now. He’s doing an even better job than he did during practice.

*<th>(whispering)</th>* The crowd is loving it.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora v2 %}
*<th>(whispering)</th>* They really are! He should definitely be able to get people interested in the club—There’s no way they wouldn’t be inspired by him!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori sigh %}
*<th>(whispering)</th>* But I feel like the better his performance, the more likely my sloppiness will stand out… which kinda scares me.
{% endbubble %}

{% img /img/es/eventstory/ninjaclan/tetorabcg.jpg %}

{% bubble Tetora v2 %}
*<th>(whispering)</th>* What’re you talking about! Instead of making yourself look bad, just match your pace to the performance itself!

*<th>(whispering)</th>* C’mon now, let’s get this place hyped up, too!

“♪\~♪\~”
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
<th>(Ah—he’s gone. Gosh, I wouldn’t be struggling here if that was easy to do, y’know…)</th>
{% endbubble %}

{% img /img/es/eventstory/ninjaclan/midoribcg.jpg %}

{% bubble Midori %}
<th>(But I know Shinobu-kun loves ninjas the same way I love mascots, and that’s what made him work so hard all this time…)</th>

<th>(So I guess I’ll do what I can to help him out…♪)</th>

“♪\~♪\~♪\~”
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shinobu v2 %}
“Shuriken throw, woosh woosh! ☆”

<th>(Nishihi~♪ They’re all surprised by the optical illusion of shurikens flying at them.)</th>

<th>(What do you think? What do you all think about my beloved ninjas!? Aren’t they so cool!?)</th>

<th>(Ninjas are those who devote themselves to their lord, and conceal themselves within the shadows of history!)</th>

<th>(It’s impossible not to love such awesome figures!)</th>

<th>(Courage is necessary to be able to tell others about your own interests, for it’s sad to be rejected or have nobody find interest in it.)</th>

<th>(But my love for them only grows stronger each passing day, so I won’t stop expressing how I feel about them!)</th>
{% endbubble %}

{% img /img/es/eventstory/ninjaclan/shinobubcg.jpg %}

{% bubble Shinobu v2 %}
“I am Ryusei Yellow, Sengoku Shinobu! I adore ninjas, and act as the inheritor of the ninja spirit!”

“Do any of you wish to join me in being a ninja~!? Please come on over to the Ninja Association at Yumenosaki Academy for more information!”
