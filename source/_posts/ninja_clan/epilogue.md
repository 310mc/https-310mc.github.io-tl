………

……Nobody is showing up.

<th>(It’s been a week since the performance, which means today is the deadline that Isara-dono gave me.)</th>

<th>(If I don’t manage to secure at least one new member by today, the Ninja Association will be disbanded forever.)</th>

………

…Mm. Not much I can do anymore… Saddening as it is.

<th>(But I’ve done everything I could—I had everyone’s help in bringing out the best of the best from me.)</th>

<th>(It is truly a shame that it still brought no success, but… I can proudly say that I tried as hard as I could.)</th>

<em>Sigh</em>… I’ll no longer be able to call this empty classroom my hangout, huh…

Ah—

Ahaha, the marks on this part of the wall take me back~ Those are from the time I accidentally slipped during a backflip and scratched it.

One of the teachers scolded me for that when they found out… It was really terrifying~

………

…and I won’t even be able to have memories like that anymore…

I’m satisfied knowing I did as much as I could, but… It’s still rather depressing…

…Getting lost in my thoughts won’t do me any good, however.

Mmm. Alright, it’s about time I report to Isara-dono.

—? Umm? Did I hear a knock on the door just now…? Did Isara-dono grow tired of waiting for me and came over instead?

Yes, who is it~? Is it you, Isara-dono?

<th>(…? Um…? Who is this person? Based on his necktie, he must be an upperclassman, but I don’t recognize him…)</th>

<th>(—Hm? I could’ve sworn I’ve seen him somewhere, though… Very recently, even…)</th>

Ah! Now I remember! You’re from ALKALOID!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mayoi %}
Y-Y-Yes! M-my d-deepest apologies. Yes… I’m Ayase Mayoi from ALKALOID…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shinobu v2 %}
Ahaha, I couldn’t recognize you at all in your student uniform. I apologize for not immediately recalling who you were!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mayoi %}
Huh!? No, nonono! It’s all my fault for being barely noticeableeeee…!!

I’ll be sure to make my presence clearer by constantly making noise!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shinobu v2 %}
Ah, erm… That would simply cause trouble to others, so I think it’s best to avoid doing that…

That said, why are you here, Ayase-dono?

This may be an empty classroom, but it’s currently being used by the Ninja Association.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mayoi %}
Y-Yes! T-That is why I’m here…

Umm… H-Here, p-please take this…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shinobu v2 %}
Hm? This says… “Club entry form”…?

Ahh, you’d like to be enlisted? And here I thought I was being evicted from this room in order to disba—

Wait, *what!?* Y-Y-Y-Y-You’d like to be <em>enlisted</em>!?

Does that mean you’ll join me!? In the Ninja Association!?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mayoi %}
Y-Yes…!

I’ve been enthralled by you ever since I saw you at the MDM[^1], Shinobu-kyu—I mean, Shinobu-san. Since then, I’ve had my eyes on you twenty-four-seven!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shinobu v2 %}
…? Had your eyes on me…?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mayoi %}
I-I-I-I’m s-s-s-so sorryyyyyy!! I-I misspoke!! I swear to you I wasn’t tailing after you to eavesdrop or peep at what you’re doing, reallyyyyy!!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shinobu v2 %}
D-Don’t worry! I wasn’t thinking anything like that.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mayoi %}
Umm… Oh, yes, I know—You see, I was following your activities, Shinobu-san.

I eventually discovered that you were going to perform a live show, so I went to watch it.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shinobu v2 %}
Huh!? You even watched our performance!?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mayoi v2 %}
Yes, of course I would! I gazed at every single movement you performed until it was burned straight into my very eyes!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shinobu v2 %}
You were watching with that much enthusiasm!?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mayoi v2 %}
Yes! With as much passion you could possibly imagine! How you look while singing and dancing with all your might is so out of this world and adora—

No, no, what I *<em>mean</em>* is… I was moved—Yes, that’s the word. My jaw simply dropped upon seeing your performance, Shinobu-san.

Your never-ending love for ninjas even instilled a deep interest in them within me.

That is why I gathered up my courage and came here in hopes of joining the Ninja Association…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shinobu curious %}
………
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mayoi %}
Eeep…!! I-I was a bother all along, wasn’t I…!? I-I-I’m so sorryyyyy!! I’m so sorry someone as lowly as me wishes to join your cluuuubbb!!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shinobu v2 %}
No, not at all~! I’m so happy… I’m super duper happy!

Let’s talk all about ninjas together from here on out!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mayoi v2 %}
Yes! If possible, I’d love to talk about you with ninjas!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shinobu v2 %}
Hm? What was that about me?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mayoi %}
Ahh, no, it’s nothing. It was simply a slip of the tongue… Please don’t mind me.

Um… Does this mean that you accept me as a club member…?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shinobu v2 %}
Of course! It’s very nice to meet you, Ayase-dono! I hope we can get along!

I welcome you to the Ninja Association!

## Translation Notes

[^1]: MDM happens at the end of August and is shown in the first main story of ES!! era. During Ryuseitai's performance, there was a scene of Mayoi spotting Shinobu performing. You'll find it in part 5, chapter name Hostage.
