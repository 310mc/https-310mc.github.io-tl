{% bubble Chiaki srsthinking %}
Hmm… I see.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata v2 %}
so you had to deal with all of that~? it must have been [rough] for you, shinobu.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shinobu sad %}
It really was… I can’t just sit by and watch my club fall to ruins… So I must do whatever it takes to keep it alive…!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki serious %}
Alright, I understand what’s happening now. So you called us over to think up a plan on how to achieve that?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori serious %}
Yeah, basically.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora v2 %}
We tried to work it out on our own at first, but we couldn’t come up with anything good enough… so we decided to go back to the basics!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki curious %}
Hmm, what would that be?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora v2 %}
We promote the Ninja Association as sincerely as possible one more time!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata neutral %}
mm~? what would be [different] about that? hasn’t shinobu been doing [that] all this time?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora v2 %}
Yeah, he didn’t make anything out of those ideas, but there’s gotta be a reason behind all that!

So we’re gonna brainstorm what went wrong, make improvements on the idea, and try it again!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shinobu v2 %}
Yes, exactly. The reason we called you here is because we’d like you to share your knowledge with us.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata v2 %}
ehh\~? we do not need to do it this way; it is too slow. if you so [desire] it, i would make sure to do [something] about it for you, shinobu\~♪

but please do not [hate me] no matter what happens, okay…?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori worried0 %}
Um, what’s that supposed to mean!? You’re scaring me…!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shinobu surprised0 %}
Shinkai-dono, let’s do this peacefully! Peacefully~!!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora curious %}
…What’re you even planning to do?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata v2 %}
fufufu~ i am only [joking]~☆ so no need to worry.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shinobu frown %}
Uuu… your jokes are bad for the heart, Shinkai-dono…

I did almost consider carrying out a nefarious plan like Shinkai-dono at first from the shock of the situation, but…

I established the Ninja Association because I love ninjas. So I want to enlist a member who would enjoy ninjas with me!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki v2 %}
Mhm, I understand how you feel, Sengoku! Comrades, right? It’s always nice to have comrades~!

I used to struggle to find friends that are fans of tokusatsu in the past, personally…

But fear not, for those feelings will be enough! You’ll find hope in this situation through your passion alone!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shinobu v2 %}
Huh…?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki v2 %}
I mean, just look around you!

I struggled for a long time to find tokusatsu friends, but now I have so many of them surrounding me…!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora curious %}
Ermm…? I’m not necessarily a tokusatsu <em>fan</em>, though…?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori sigh %}
Why’s he talking like we’re part of the same group…? I mean, sure, I know a bit more about them now, but that’s about it…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki surprised0 %}
Huh!? W-What do you mean by all that…!? Didn’t we talk passionately about it in our school year together!?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori curious %}
That’s ‘cause you always mention it to us after every Sunday… so we just so happened to follow along…?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora serious %}
Yeah, and if we couldn’t watch the episode in time, you’d explain what happened in so much detail that we wouldn’t even need to actually watch it to catch up.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata v2 %}
i personally enjoy seeing chiaki having [fun], so…♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora v2 %}
Anyway, we may not be *fans* of it, but… It’s fun once you get down and watch it, and it gets really intense with its turning points. So all in all, I got more interested in ‘em!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki v2 %}
Mhm! I can tell we pick up on things a little differently, but either way, you understand the charm of the shows!

That’s why I’m sure there’s someone out there who shares the same passion as you, Sengoku. There’s no need to fret!

We’ll find a breakthrough together!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shinobu v2 %}
Morisawa-dono…

You’re right! There’s no chance for me to save my club if I do nothing…

But the chances will rise if I at least try!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki v2 %}
Exactly! That’s the spirit~! ☆
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shinobu worried %}
But what should I do then, exactly?

I tried to promote the Ninja Association in as many ways as I could possibly think of… but it seems to always attract the incorrect set of people.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki serious %}
Hmm… Let’s see here…

—Do you like how ninjas look, Sengoku? Or do you like the very being of a ninja?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shinobu curious %}
Huh?
{% endbubble %}

## Chapter 2

{% bubble Chiaki v2 %}
I’d like to know what ninjas personally mean to you.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shinobu curious %}
Ermm…? Are you asking me if I like a regular person wearing a ninja outfit, or if I like the concept of ninjas who conceal themselves?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki v2 %}
Hm…? That’s one way to put it… But yeah, something like that.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shinobu v2 %}
Then there’s only one way I’d answer that!

It’s because to me, the very form of ninjas and the weapons that they use are cool! But most of all, I think the way of the ninja is a super cool lifestyle!

They endure any and all hardships, and never reveal themselves in the front lines—They devote their all to their lord and carry out their duty to the very end! That’s what I find so cool about them!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki smilesoft2 %}
Mhm, then the solution is simple. You’ll just need to show off those charms to the right people, in the right location.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora curious %}
…? What does that mean?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata frownshake %}
gosh… chiaki expresses things in such a [roundabout] way.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki awkward %}
Ahh, sorry, my bad. Basically, I considered where the issue lies…

And I’m wondering if the problem may be that he hasn’t been expressing the charms of a ninja to the right market.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
Market…? Umm, so it’s like if you tried advertising vegetables in a butcher’s shop?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki v2 %}
Yep. What sort of image do you guys have of ninjas?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori curious %}
Huh? Uhh, I dunno how to answer that on the spot…

Um, I guess I think of historical plays…?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora northinking %}
Shinobu-kun is always talking ‘bout ninjas in every single way, so I never really considered it.

But I guess it’d be their history, or like, historical plays… Basically, the old stuff.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shinobu v2 %}
That makes sense, considering the historical village in Scroll of the Elements fits the era of ninjas more than, say, downtown or something.

So that was the problem?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki v2 %}
I believe so. If I were to use tokusatsu as an example—

Tokusatsu shows go way back, so imagine if the very first tokusatsu show was broadcasted to kids of this generation. How do you think they’d react?

I doubt that it’d be a hit among them. They’d say it’s too old-fashioned, since the current shows are much more high quality with their editing, and the quality standards have risen.

They may call *that* version of tokusatsu old-fashioned, but they don’t necessarily think tokusatsu *itself* is.

After all, kids from every generation have watched and enjoyed these shows, right?

That’s because tokusatsu shows have always made sure to adjust the themes and visuals to appeal to the current age.

The current tokusatsu shows are regarded as modern because they used previous heroes as the foundation, and applied the current trends onto their shows.

It’s for this reason that tokusatsu shows have lasted for this long, even if the process and the visuals have changed vastly.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shinobu v2 %}
W-Wait a minute, you’re right…!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata v2 %}
ohh~ i get what chiaki was trying to [say] now.

so basically, we need to [show off] a [ninja] style that fits the modern [age], yes?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki v2 %}
Yep, exactly! Ah—but we still need to make sure we appeal the charm correctly.

That’s how you’ll see a glimmer of light at the end of the tunnel!
