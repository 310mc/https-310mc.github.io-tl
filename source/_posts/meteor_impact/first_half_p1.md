{% bubble Chiaki mgn %}
Heh… The ally of justice has arrived in all his splendid glory.

Now, let’s begin our Super Hero Time! As long as I’m here, evil shall never prosper! Fuhahahaha!! ☆

…………

<th>(…It’s too scary! I’m trying to shake off my fear with super cool catchphrases, but I can’t take this anymore! I wanna go home~!!)</th>

<th>(Uuu… Just the thought of the school at the dead of the night is terrifying enough…)</th>

<th>(A dirty pool filled with sludge only makes it worse… It’d be more shocking if a ghost or demon *didn’t* show up…)</th>

<th>(No! It’ll be fine! Ghosts don’t exist! They’re just something people see when they’re half asleep![^1] It’s only my imagination!)</th>

<th>(Besides, despite having idols for students, the school’s security is really low… What I should be more cautious about are the chances of a suspicious person intruding the place!)</th>

<th>(The most terrifying thing in this world has always been humans, not imaginary ghosts!)</th>

<th>(Uuu! You idiot, me! Why are you even *talking* about freaky stuff!? I-I’m just gonna stop thinking about this!)</th>

<th>(Let’s get this job done quickly, and go home!)</th>

<th>(F-Fuhaha! My duty for today is pool cleaning!)</th>

<th>(This pool is barely used, so it’s been dirty for a long time now. But apparently the other day, some of my comrades from Ryuseitai lit up sparklers here…)</th>

<th>(They ended up not only leaving burn marks, but also dirtying the place with leftover food, so the teachers are furious.)</th>

<th>(It sounds like the actions of my members are becoming inexcusable to the faculty staff…)</th>

<th>(Sagami-sensei told me in secret that they may disband it at this point.)</th>

<th>(But I can’t let that happen! I won’t let Ryuseitai end like this—Not when it has such a long and proud history!)</th>

<th>(There are still some members who never take part in any of these bad deeds, and properly work hard — like our leader, Taichou!)</th>

<th>(I’m going to protect Ryuseitai myself! No, I’ll *save* it! No one asked me to do this, but I’ll still start by cleaning all the dirt from the pool!)</th>

<th>(I’m sure that if I make the pool usable, the teachers will think better of us!)</th>

<th>(I had a lot of unnecessary work pushed on me all day, so I couldn’t start until late at night…)</th>

<th>(It’s dark, creepy, and terrifying here, but! I’ll be fine! The night always comes to an end!)</th>

<th>(Let’s do this! Justice will always prevail!)</th>

Hmhm\~hmm~…♪

Woosh! Chiaki Crusheeeerrrr!! <em><th>(Cleans the pool’s floor with a mop)</th></em>

Now’s my chance! Take this! Finishing move: Chiaki Beaaaaaaam!! <em><th>(Washes it down with a hose)</th></em>

Fuhaha! How’s that!? Feel like giving up yet, you evildoers!? Yup, let’s go with the idea that the black sludge was created by the malice within people’s hearts!

The only person who can purify it all is the one and only, Morisawa Chiaki…☆

Yes, aaalright! I’m all pumped up!

Now I can forget all about my fears, and—

…Eeek!?

<th>(Huh!? W-What was that weird sound just now!? A dog’s wail…? Or maybe a bird…? Or was it just my echo…?)</th>

<em>…<th>(Gulp)</th></em>

U-Um, hellooo…? I-Is there someone… out there…?

…………

<th>(…N-No response. Of course there wouldn’t be.)</th>

<th>(No one in our school is enthusiastic enough to practice past schooltime, and the teacher currently on duty isn’t that serious about their job, either.)</th>

<th>(I specifically chose a day like this, just so I could clean the pool in secret.)</th>

<th>(This is something I personally planned to do… If someone catches me here, I could get scolded for doing something wrong.)</th>

<th>(Even though I’m doing the opposite.)</th>

…Even though, I only want to become a hero.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata pastcurious %}
“hee-roe”…? what is that?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki mgnworried %}
…!?

<th>(…Huh!? W-What!? Somebody’s collapsed within the sludge!)</th>

<th>(He’s soaking in it! I-Is he dead!? No, no! He spoke just now, didn’t he…!?)</th>

A g-g-g-ghost!? Oh no, it’s really here—Eeeeeeeek!!!!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata pastcurious %}
what is “goo-st”?

i do not know this Word. could you teach me, please?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki mgnworried %}
Huh!? Um, no… What!? W-What are you!? *I’msosorry<wbr>someonesaveme<wbr>pleasedon’tcurseme* I’m not tasty!!!

<div class="msr-narration">
    <p>Several minutes later…</p>
</div>

{% bubble Chiaki mgn %}
Hmm, okay… I’ll hose you with water like you asked — Are you sure you’re okay with that, umm… Shinkai-kun?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata past %}
yes! i Love water~ it is my Life force!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki mgn %}
Uh, yeah… I think that could be said about anyone, really… Also, you’re covered in sludge at the moment, so it makes sense that you’d want to wash yourself off with water.

Do you have a change of clothes with you? You wouldn’t want to go home completely drenched, right? If you don’t have any, I’ll bring some over.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata pastcurious %}
……?

i am very sorry. please talk more Slowly. i cannot pick up what you are saying.

i apologize. i am not used to having a Conversation…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki mgn %}
Huh? Ahh, sorry! Did I talk too fast? I don’t have any friends, so I’m bad at it myself!

Heheh. You always seemed like a distant being, so I’m happy to know we share something in common.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata pastcurious %}
…? is that so? you are Happy we share something?

why would you be Happy about that?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki mgn %}
<th>(U-Umm… I feel like we’re never on the same page… It doesn’t feel like I’m talking to a human being… Although, he does seem to know Japanese.)</th>

<th>(He keeps asking me questions after everything I say… this conversation is getting nowhere.)</th>

<th>(I’m not that knowledgeable myself, and I keep getting stuck trying to answer all his questions.)</th>

<th>(Is there no one around Shinkai-kun to teach him all of these things…?)</th>

<th>(It doesn’t *look* that way, though… I’ve got the impression that he’s a well-known student within the school, and that he constantly has followers around him.)</th>

<th>(Shinkai Kanata… We’re in different classes, and I’ve never talked to him until now, so I don’t know much about him, but…)</th>

<th>(If I remember clearly, he passed his entrance exam with flying colors. He even ranked as high as Itsuki Shu and Hibiki Wataru for certain subjects, or possibly even higher.)</th>

<th>(That’s only a rumor, though. The entrance exam results have never actually been shown to the public.)</th>

<th>(Still, he’s a prodigy from a different world compared to me, an ordinary person.)</th>

<th>(I studied hard for the same exam and, my results for the written portion aside, my practical skills were unremarkable.)</th>

<th>(Although apparently I would’ve still been accepted into the academy even if I’d never bothered to study…)</th>

<th>(I just have to believe in the fact that everything I’ve studied and learned won’t go to waste… Not just that, but for everything else I’ve done so far, too.)</th>

<th>(For now, I have to work hard, then work harder, then even harder and harder.)</th>

<th>(It’ll all pay off if I just keep working hard to the best of my abilities… I’m sure of it.)</th>
{% endbubble %}

{% img /img/es/eventstory/meteorimpact/firsthalfch2_1.jpg %}

{% bubble Kanata past %}
…? what is wrong? ummm, you…?

i did not ask for your name, did i? could you tell me what it is?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki mgn %}
Huh? Ahh, you wouldn’t know who I am, would you…?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata past %}
yes! i Realized this recently! a big discovery! fufu~♪

each Human has their own Name!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki mgn %}
Uh…? Yeah, of course we do. Everyone gets a name from their parents.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata pastcurious %}
from their pa-ren-ts? what is “pa-ren-ts”?

is it a Necessity? where can i get one?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki mgn %}
What? Umm…?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata pastcurious %}
if it is a Necessity, then i would like it. i have to act more Human, or everyone will be in Distress, it seems.

where can i get one? or do i need to Buy it with Money from some place?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki mgnworried %}
<th>(…What’s he talking about!? Does he really not know the concept of parents…!? No, no! There’s no way that could be true, right…?)</th>

<th>(No, wait… He might have a complicated family situation.)</th>

<th>(He *is* from another world, after all… I don’t think I should dig into this topic.)</th>

<th>(Not when I’m nothing but a nobody who just so happened to talk to him.)</th>
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata pastcurious %}
…? what is wrong? could you give me a Response? i am sorry. was it a difficult Question?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki mgn %}
Ahh, no… That last question was a bit too difficult for me, but I can answer your first one.

My name is Morisawa Chiaki. I’m a first year like you, and I’m currently in a unit called Ryuseitai. I’m still in the lower ranks, though.

Ryuseitai doesn’t have as much influential power as Othello[^2], but it does have a lot of members. It’s split between two squads: the first squad is always performing onstage and brimming with glory, while the second squad supports them.

I’m in the second squad, and I’m meant to do the trivial tasks. And honestly, it’s only natural that I was placed in it; I’m a newcomer. I could never allow myself to take a senior position.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata pastcurious %}
“ryu-sei-tai”… ahh, mikejima’s Manservants?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki mgn %}
Mikejima? It is true that he’s in the unit, but I’ve never talked to him before.

He may be a first year, but he’s the leading star of the first squad. He’s completely above my level… Is he your acquaintance?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata pastcurious %}
what is “a-kwain-tans”? is that different to Family?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki mgn %}
F-Family? Mikejima-kun’s part of your family!? Your brother, maybe? Ah no, you’re both the same age and you don’t look the same, so that can’t be it… right?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata pastfrown %}
hmm… i think he *wants* to become Family, but… i do not quite understand… how long will he be Playing house…?
{% endbubble %}

## Chapter 3

{% img /img/es/eventstory/meteorimpact/firsthalfch3.jpg %}

{% bubble Kanata pastfrown %}
just give me water already. do not make me repeat the Same thing twice. you Should listen to what a God says.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki mgn %}
Ahaha, you’re a God, Shinkai-kun? Well, you *do* have godly potential.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata pastcurious %}
yes. from the day i was born, until i die.

chiaki, you are not a God, are you?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki mgn %}
Y-You’re casually calling me by my first name, huh… It’s fine, though. Nope, I’m not~ I’m just your ordinary, everyday guy.

But even someone like me can make your little wish come true! I’ll spray water on you! Be careful not to slip and fall from the water!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata past %}
yes, feel free to do so. i have been waiting.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki mgn %}
Ah, but before that! If you want to clean the dirt off of you, then you’ll need soap! Wait a moment!

I think there was some equipment near the drinking fountain…?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata pastfrown %}
mm… just do it already, please. i Cannot do anything without Water.

i will dry up… without Water, it is painful…

that is why i had jumped into this Pool, thinking there would be Water…

but, there was none… i banged my head on the surface, and Fainted.

it was an Earnest match between the two of us~… chiaki? are you listening?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki mgn %}
<th>*(Humming)*</th> \~♪~♪ Oh! I found the soap! Ahaha, it’s so fancy! Alright, I may as well find a towel to wipe the dirt off!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata pastfrown %}
—… …hurry.

chiaki… i… really, will—…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki mgn %}
Hm? Shinkai-kun, did you call for me? Just give me a second longer!

If I remember clearly, there was a jersey in the room for Ryuseitai — I’ll bring one over. It’s better to have a change of clothes, so!

I think that jersey was left behind by the student who quit our unit the other day, so it should be okay to use it…

Yeah, I’ll just make sure to wash it and put it back in its place so I don’t end up stealing it.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata pastfrown %}
…………
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki mgnworried %}
…Shinkai-kun?

W-What’s wrong!? Say something, please! The dark is terrifying! I was able to forget about all my fears because you were chatting!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata pastfrown %}
…………
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki mgnworried %}
Shinkai-kun? Woah— Why are you collapsed on the floor!? Is it from anemia? Did you faint!? Are you alriiiiight~!?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata pastfrown %}
…chiaki, w-water…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki mgnworried %}
Water!? Yeah, sorry for the long wait! I’ll spray water on you now! Here goes—!!!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata past %}
…………☆
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki mgnworried %}
W-Was that good enough…? Please say something!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata past %}
…whew~♪ yes, i am feeling Better now. i have been revived.

Kyahahahahaha!! ☆
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki mgnworried %}
Eeek!? W-What!? Don’t laugh out of nowhere! You surprised me!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata past %}
i am sorry! i am just so happy, and feeling tingly…♪

fufu. if it is what you Wish, i will not laugh.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki mgnworried %}
N-no, I’d rather see you smiling than have a straight face… The sudden laughter took me by surprise, that’s all.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata past %}
fufu. you are the Timid type, yes?

Kyaha— Kyahahaha! ♪ Kyahahahahaha…!! ☆
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki mgnworried %}
<th>(E-Ermm…? Never mind, it really is terrifying, Shinkai-kun! I don’t get anything you do — It’s just too bizarre!)</th>
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata past %}
…am i scary?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki mgnworried %}
!? Wha—!? Did I say it out loud!?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata past %}
i can tell by your Face. i have been slowly able to understand those things…

humans have many, many Expressions, especially compared to fish.

i am sorry for scaring you… and thank you for the water.

i have to Repay you somehow, since you have given me a Tribute.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki mgn %}
Tribute? No no, no need for anything! It’s been awhile since I—no, I think this is the very first time I’ve properly helped someone, so I’m more than happy!

Your smile is my reward! Heheh, that sounded a little bit like a hero~♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata pastcurious %}
“hero”[^3]… what exactly is that? you said you want to Become that, yes?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki mgn %}
Huh? Ahh… You heard me talking to myself… That’s so embarrassing…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata past %}
is it something embarrassing?

it is alright~ i will not look Down on it. i will Affirm any Wish, because i am a God.

if that is what you wish, then i will grant it for you. that is my Job. will that be a sufficient Repayment, chiaki?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki mgn %}
Ahahaha, if I could make it come true just by wishing, it would be a lot simpler than this. Reality isn’t so simple in the end; it’s different from tokusatsu shows.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata pastcurious %}
“toku-sa-tsu”…? what is that?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki mgn %}
Mhm, I’m sure you’ve seen it at least once, haven’t you? You’re a guy, after all! C’mon, y’know, it’s the ones that go *“Transform!”*
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata pastcurious %}
…“to-rans-form”?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki mgn %}
Yes! Like this, and like this! This is No.1’s transformation[^4] pose, and this is No.2’s! ☆
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata pastcurious %}
number… one…? i am sorry, i do not understand…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki mgn %}
Huh. You aren’t the type to watch TV? Then why did you want to become an idol? Is it because you watched one at a liveshow or something?

I’ve always watched all kinds of idols perform on TV! It’s how I came to like them, and why I wanted to become one!

Becoming a hero is hard when reality is the way it is, but I could become an idol if I work hard, right?

I want to become the dream version of myself! The cool, ideal version!

## Chapter 4

<div class="msr-cw">
    <span><b>Content Warning</b></span>
    <p>Light mentions of bullying and cannibalism ahead.</p>
</div>

{% img /img/es/eventstory/meteorimpact/firsthalfch4.jpg %}

{% bubble Kanata pastcurious %}
…is that your Wish, chiaki?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki mgn %}
Yep! It’s proving to be difficult, but! Finding out that Ryuseitai existed after entering this school made me jump with joy!

I mean, they’re hero-like idols, y’know? It’s the exact ideal I’ve yearned for!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata pastcurious %}
hm, that is ryuseitai…?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki mgn %}
Yep! Oh, though… I don’t know if you know this, but at the moment, Ryuseitai is pretty far from being “heroic.” I mean, they’re still only halfway there when it comes to behaving like idols!

The captain, Mikejima-kun, and some others have been properly acting as idols, but…

The others, especially the second squad, just rely on those members, and play around as they like.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata pastcurious %}
hm. is it a bad thing to Play around? both Playing and Singing[^5] are a splendid way to worship, though…?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki mgn %}
No no, it isn’t *bad*… I’m just unsatisfied — I don’t feel like it’s enough. I mean, the way they act is the usual for this school, but…

If they just live off of the legacy of the past without ever working hard themselves, then they’ll never be able to put all their heart into this. I feel like we’ll end up in a tight spot, personally…

But the last time I got fed up, I yelled at them to be more serious… And after that, it looks like they just saw me as an eyesore.

They don’t speak to me anymore, and they’ve been pushing all kinds of unnecessary work on me ever since…

Is this bullying? No no, it must be my fault for not properly reading the atmosphere, right?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata pastcurious %}
atmosphere… yes, that is a Necessity.

does that mean you are Suffocating, chiaki?

that is Sad… you will die if you cannot breathe…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki mgn %}
Huh!? No, I’m not physically incapable of breathing!

Don’t worry, don’t worry! I won’t die! I’m fine!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata past %}
fufu, you will not die? so you ate Mermaid meat?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki mgn %}
Huh? Ahh, do you mean the Yaobikuni legend?[^6] You know about that?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata past %}
yes, since it is not Unrelated to me… but, then, what is your Wish?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki mgn %}
Hm? Ah, no, it isn’t a wish per se… I just want everyone to be a little more serious, that’s all.

Well, there isn’t any point in me asking for that, though.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata pastcurious %}
…? what do you mean?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki mgn %}
…Ryuseitai will likely disband soon if it keeps going at this pace.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata pastcurious %}
hm? what is “dis-ba-nd”?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki mgn %}
It means it’ll disappear. What a shame, Ryuseitai is the very first unit established in Yumenosaki with a proud and long history…

Besides Mikejima-san, only our captain is doing his job properly, but apparently he’s been hired from overseas.

There’s still some time left before graduation, but there’s talk that he’s already preparing to leave.

Which means he’ll be dropping out of school to start doing independent work. Those types of people aren’t rare — Talented students always abandon studying here and leave for someplace else.

You’ll gain nothing from being here, after all…

The classes are poor quality, no one bothers to do anything, and lately the school’s been having a bad reputation within the industry.

Any talented student capable of starting their own independent career has no reason to stay here.

Also… No adult in this school helps you out in anything, and if you stay around the rotten students, you’ll turn rotten yourself.

Even I… If I could just have more talent and capability—…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata pastcurious %}
…………
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki mgn %}
Ahh, I’m sorry for complaining. Point is, only the captain of Ryuseitai has been properly working as an idol, but he may leave the school. That’s why Ryuseitai might disband.

All the members who had been leeching off of him are at a loss, and aren’t really sure what to do.

So lately, all they’ve been doing every time we meet is talk badly of the captain, calling him heartless and stuff…

Just because he’s the captain doesn’t mean he has any obligation to take care of his fellow members.

“Captain”… “Leader”… Those titles are only something written in documents — They don’t mean you have any responsibilities, or influence.

But apparently, the captain plans to quit being an idol to become an action star instead.

Which means, there’s less chance of him bringing any idol work to us through our connection as Ryuseitai.

That’s why the members who had been aiming for that are voicing out their frustrations.

They were hoping to suck out all the good bits from the captain by being part of this unit, so now they're complaining that they were betrayed…

The captain knows this, and it seems he’s gotten fed up with it. He doesn’t show up to the unit’s gatherings anymore.

Not that we do any practice when we gather, anyway — Everyone just plays around.

But soon, we won’t even have gatherings like that anymore.

Ryuseitai will naturally disband on its own, I think. With the way things are right now, there won’t be anyone to inherit the role of the captain, so.

Everyone has been talking about leaving the unit, and joining Othello instead.

No one will bother to protect Ryuseitai. They just want to do whatever’s the most convenient.

As for what I’ll do… I don’t want to become rotten like the rest, but I don’t have the capability to protect Ryuseitai.

I’m trying to help the unit stay alive by cleaning the pool, but… If it disappears anyway, then all my efforts would be futile.

I’m starting to find it pointless to protect Ryuseitai — There’s no hope.

There’s no point in continuing my hero act all alone, either… I’d only waste my precious youth like this.

I’m so weak, so dumb, so pathetic… I criticize others but I’m not any better — I’m just going with the flow without accomplishing a single thing.

The ideal image of the hero I yearn to become is still so far away — I could almost cry.

…………

…Oh! I’m sorry! I just talked to myself for ages! I’m sure it was boring and awful to hear…

Heheh, you’re so strange, Shinkai-kun… I’ve never ever vented any of these thoughts out, but…

You aren’t even my friend, yet I can’t help but tell you my secrets.

Please forget everything I said. It has nothing to do with you.

I ain’t gonna hurt ya or somethin’. I don’t ever lay a finger on good people.

{% bubble Chiaki mgn %}
Heheh, so you can crack jokes like that, Kiryu-kun? I didn’t expect that, with how you’re always silent and looking so sour during class.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kuro pastinjured %}
Huh, that so.. Well, I jus’ don’t really like ta talk, is all.

Nobody comes over to talk to me, anyway — Guess they’re scared or somethin’. I don’t even bother tryin’ ta talk to the other guys skippin’ class.

But, eh, guess school is for studyin’ anyway, not havin’ fun with friends.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki mgn %}
Y-Yeah, that’s right. I didn’t expect you to be the type to think about this seriously.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kuro pastinjured %}
Well, yeah… I’m tryin’ ta take it seriously, after all. Not that there’s any point in doin’ that here. Even the teachers seem like they’ve given up — They do whatever they want for their classes.

What an expensive waste… This school ain’t cheap.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki mgn %}
Yeah, I feel the same way, too. … Okay, let me clean the wound — It’ll sting a bit.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kuro pastinjured %}
Got it. … Sorry for makin’ you help me out, Glasses-boy.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki mgn %}
It’s nothing, don’t worry about it. After all, it’s a hero’s duty to help those in need!

{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kuro pastinjured %}
Hmm… Ahh right, you’re in Ryuseitai, aren’t ya? So the title ain’t just for show, huh — There really are guys in there actually bein’ heroes.

You guys have an awful rep. Keep hearin’ that you break stuff everywhere, and make a huge ruckus wherever you go…

Well, since I’m a delinquent an’ all… the whiny brats in the streets are always tryin’ ta pick a fight with me, yeah?

That’s where I hear your unit’s name a lot. Always sayin’ they’re an eyesore and all, that they’ll put ’em down sooner or later, or whatever… Better keep yourself safe if you’re out at night.

You all just seem to be doing whatever you like, but you guys’re all just spoiled li’l brats born an’ raised from a well-off, sheltered family in the end.

All you guys’re gonna be done for once a *real* delinquent’s got their eyes on ya. They’ll play with ya like a plush toy ’til there’s no stuffing left inside ya.

Just go play around somewhere the nicer, peaceful adults can protect ya.

Don’t bother comin’ into the sewers here — There’s nothin’ interesting floatin’ around.

No, I’m thankful for the warning. You’re a good person… Kiryu-kun.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kuro pastinjured %}
*Huh*? You got your eyes on wrong or somethin’? How the hell’re ya seein’ somethin’ good in me?

I’m just as delinquent as I look. I ain’t someone people like you should be minglin’ with.

Talkin’ to you and joinin’ this school… feels like I’ll start regrettin’ it all…

I really was dreamin’ of a chance to possibly becomin’ a more honest, good man, though…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki mgn %}

{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kuro pastinjured %}
…Doesn’t matter. So, you done? Thanks, I appreciate it.

I’m goin’ back to sleep now, so go to class already… Honor student.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki mgn %}
No, hold on—I haven’t finished the treatment. I’m not one to give up halfway when doing something, so please let me finish up.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kuro pastinjured %}
Haha, you’re surprisingly fussy, aren’tcha?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki mgn %}
Hm… But how did you end up covered in bruises like this? You seem to have been kicked and punched all over, there’s no other way to explain it… Did you get into a fight?

You shouldn’t do that. Violence solves nothing.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kuro pastinjured %}
*Huh*? Ain’t that backwards? Violence is the *only* way to solve anything.

At the very least, that’s the kind of world *I’ve* been livin’ in. I asked for this myself, and now I’ve gone rotten and become a shitty delinquent.

Harming everything around me… And lately, I’ve been payin’ the price for that. That’s all there is to it. I ain’t actually goin’ around pickin’ fights or anythin’.

I got caught and surrounded by my old pals, and, y’know… I took their blows without fightin’ back, and there you have it.

I ain’t done any resistin’ nor defendin’, so I *guess* you could say I’m the victim here.

But you got nothin’ to worry about — It’s unlikely this’ll cause any huge uproar… so I won’t cause any problem’s to all ya idol brats.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki mgn %}
W-what do you mean? Your old pals…?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kuro pastinjured %}
It’s none of your business. … Just forget about it, I’ve already said too much.

It’s better off if you just pretend ya never saw me…

But you’re a good guy an’ all… Talkin’ to me and treatin’ my wounds even when you’re shakin’…

That’s exactly why I don’t want ya gettin' involved with me any more than this. Seriously, I’m not jokin’ around here… Just don’t.

I hate, *hate* seein’ anyone else get hurt all because they got close to me.

If I let that happen again… I’ll really have had no reason to ever been born. It’d be unforgivable to my ma — the one who went through so much to give birth to me.

{% bubble Chiaki mgn %}
Eep!? Wh-what is it… um, class rep?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Keito v2 %}
Hasumi. But if you want to call me “class rep,” that’s fine. I am the class representative, after all.

And because nobody else wants to take on the responsibility, I’m head of the library committee as well.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki mgn %}
I-I see… Um, that must be a lot of work.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Keito v2 %}
Not really. Taking on such titles means that I receive that much authority as well.

Well, I also take on the responsibilities as well, but I accept that as something like a necessary expense.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki mgn %}
<th>(He has a long-winded manner of speaking. Hasumi-kun… I’d never spoken to him until now, so I didn’t know this, but he’s as straight-laced as he looks.)</th>
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Keito v2 %}
…? What are you scrutinizing me for… Is it my glasses?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki mgn %}
Eh? No, sorry! Was I being rude?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Keito v2 %}
Hmph. …Your glasses are rather nice as well. Where did you get them?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki mgn %}
Huh? I mean… At an everyday eyewear store in my neighborhood.

My eyesight isn’t that bad, but I got these when my dad got a pair. He said that it’d be cheaper with the family discount if we purchased together.

I gave my dad a lot of trouble with my tuition, so I thought it would be good if I could help him save up.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Keito v2 %}
I see. Well, glasses get quite expensive if you want to purchase good ones.

They say you get what you pay for, but lately even the stores for middle-class customers sell higher quality glasses, perhaps because they manage to save on material costs through mass production.

That’s capitalism. Companies compete through pricing and the like, and ultimately quality is improved overall.

…I feel like that thought will be a useful lesson of all sorts. I’m going to write it down, so give me a moment.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki mgn %}
Okay… Um, so what is it, really? Did you want to talk about glasses that badly?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Keito v2 %}
No. I want to talk to you about something else. You, sign this… I mean, I would like you to sign this.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki mgn %}
Sign?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Keito v2 %}
Yes. I’m actually thinking of establishing a Student Council.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki mgn %}
A Student Council…? Wait, Yumenosaki didn’t have one? Don’t schools usually have one?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Keito v2 %}
Indeed. There seems to have existed one in the distant past, but at one point no one had inherited the position, and it eventually disappeared….

And then it was kept in this strange limbo of whether or not it actually existed for the longest time.

When I asked a teacher, I was told that I essentially needed to start from scratch to create an entirely new Student Council if I wanted to make it active again…

And when I looked into the school rules, it seemed like I needed over half the students in the school to sign the petition.

Well, knowing the teachers at our school, I suspect they won’t even properly examine the conditions when we establish it, but….

I don’t want to pretend I established it properly, only for them look into the fact that I didn’t get enough signatures to officially do so… That’s why I thought I would go through the proper procedures.

I want to prove that we have obtained the approval of the students—that the students want us, the Student Council.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki mgn %}
Heheh. I see that you’re a serious guy, Hasumi-kun. I don’t dislike it.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Keito v2 %}
That is my strength. In any case, the Student Council is an organization that supports students—just as the name suggests. It should be helpful without getting in the way.

So if you could, I’d like you to sign this, saying… “I support establishing a Student Council.”

I keep running around and bowing my head, asking people to sign, but most people don’t even listen to me.

And it’s becoming a bit of a hassle. I feel like I’ve tripped before I could even start running.

Worst case scenario, I could ask Eichi to bribe them in secret, but… No, I’d rather not already owe him at this stage.

If possible, I want to stay equals with him. Being indebted to him forever… Just thinking about it makes my heart sink.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki mgn %}
…? What are you talking about?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Keito v2 %}
Nothing. It’s just about my situation. So… will you sign, or will you not?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki mgn %}
Ah, right. If that’s the case, I’ll gladly sign. I can even ask around and help you gather more signatures, too.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Keito v2 %}
Hm. That would be helpful. You don’t seem like the kind of person who has many friends, so I won’t expect much, but… I appreciate it.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki mgn %}
We should help each other out during times of need, y’know. I hope you manage to establish the Student Council.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Keito v2 %}
Thank you. Well, I have no idea how this will go, but I plan to do my best.

Please lend me your support for my dream. If even just one person sympathizes with my cause and is willing to support me… I can continue to fight.

Please believe in me. I will be the one to change Yumenosaki Academy.

{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki mgn %}
Um… Well, yes, that is my number one dream, but, hm…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata past %}
hm~ i am not very sure what a hero is, so i am stuck. what exactly is it?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki mgn %}
Huh—Um, I’m not sure how to explain it off the top of my head… Well, like… It’s a cool being, who would protect everybody.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata past %}
…? is that not what a God is?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki mgn %}
No, it’s different from a God. It’s more realistic, like… Defeating villains one after the other, and upholding justice to the very end. And they’re always protecting the helpless—
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata pastcurious %}
hm~? i am unable to make a distinction between the two… to defeat Villains — is that different from Divine Punishment?

this is difficult… i recall mikejima was called a hero by others… perhaps i will ask him. after all, he seems to Know many things.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki mgn %}
Hm? What’s up with Mikejima-san? Ah, so he returned back to Japan, huh? But I don’t see him in our Ryuseitai meetups…?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata past %}
fufufu. mikejima immediately breaks anything, you see. but, he Fears that side of Himself the most.

so, when he feels Irritated, he leaves to someplace Far away, as he does not want to meet with his Frightening Self.

but lately, he is probably in this Country more often. see, since i am here, after all… and mikejima’s Job is to be Useful for me.

i don’t really need him to, though… for mikejima to do all the Work is so stingy of him, isn’t it? don’t you think so too?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki mgnworried %}
Huh? Huhhh…? I’m sorry, I’m not quite sure I understand you!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata pastcurious %}
is that so… are the things i am saying difficult to comprehend? i am sorry, i am still not used to Speaking very much.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki mgn %}
Ah, no, there’s nothing you need to apologize for—Oh.

Sorry, seems like I’m being called over. I’ll have to go now!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata pastcurious %}
called over?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki mgn %}
Yeah, I got a text from our leader… I wonder what this is all about…? I don’t think he’s even been around at school ever since he decided to quit.

Well, no matter. I’ll know once I ask him.

Heheh, alright then, Shinkai-kun. I’m happy we got to talk. Oh, and… you cleaned the pool in my stead, right? I really do appreciate it.

<th>(Just thinking about how he managed to clean the pool in one night is a little unsettling, but…)</th>

<th>(He didn’t do anything wrong, and it seems like he simply did his best for my sake.)</th>

<th>(It’s been a while since I’ve been treated this kindly — I feel sort of touched.)</th>

Heheh, well then, I’ll see you later… Shinkai-kun, I know I keep saying this but — You shouldn’t soak yourself with water, okay? It’s still too early in the season to swim.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata pastfrown %}
hm? i am not swimming, i am just *puka puka*-ing.

if only there were other Places like this around…

i feel as if i will dry out. the Land is always so dry, it is difficult to Breathe.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki mgn %}
…?

## Translation Notes
[^1]: Chiaki is referencing <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZL5JPvXn7Q" target="_blank">this</a> children’s song. The English lyrics can be found <a href="http://kimonobeat.tumblr.com/post/153209333239/hirota-mieko-lyrics-obake-nante-nai-sa" target="_blank">here</a>.
[^2]: Othello was the previous name of Knights when Izumi and Leo were first years.
[^3]: He says “hero” in katakana, which is the proper spelling, and from here on he’ll continue to say it in the proper spelling.
[^4]: This is a reference to the first <a href="https://kamenrider.fandom.com/wiki/Kamen_Rider" target="_blank">Kamen Rider</a> series, where the first rider was called <a href="https://kamenrider.fandom.com/wiki/Takeshi_Hongo" target="_blank">Kamen Rider ichi-go</a>, and the second <a href="https://kamenrider.fandom.com/wiki/Hayato_Ichimonji" target="_blank">Kamen Rider ni-go</a>. The two poses Chiaki is referring to can be seen <a href="https://twitter.com/ryuseitai_info/status/1123771801639825408" target="_blank">here</a>. As extra info, even Chiaki’s 2* card is a reference to <a href="https://ensemble-stars.fandom.com/wiki/%28Academy_Idol%29_Chiaki_Morisawa" target="_blank">Kamen Rider ichi-go’s pose</a>.
[^5]: To worship in Japanese is <em>matsuru</em> (祭る), and is where the word <em>matsuri</em> (祭り) is derived from.
[^6]: The tale of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ningyo" target="_blank">Yaobikuni</a>, about a girl who ate mermaid meat, and went on to live for 800 years.
[^7]: 押しかけ女房, lit. a woman who intrudes a man’s home to live with him, regardless of his consent. It’s likely that Chiaki is making a joke out of what he’s doing.
[^8]: In Japanese, he refers to him as 眼鏡くん (Megane-kun).
[^9]: The literal translation is “you have a cute face, so I couldn’t tell,” but I added “boyish” for clarity of his joke.
[^10]: Keito was about to refer to Chiaki with <em>kisama</em> (rude “you”), but quickly switches it to *kimi* to sound more friendly.
