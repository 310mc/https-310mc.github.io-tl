<th>(Urmmm…)</th>

<th>(Nope, no good. No matter how much I stare at this billboard, nothing new will suddenly appear. The number of jobs to choose from has clearly decreased.)</th>

<th>(I guess we’re in recession, in a way. After all, last year’s graduates had a bad reputation within the industry, so our school’s been getting less job offers.)</th>

<th>(That’s just how society is. They won’t hire incapable people…)</th>

<th>(Even the graduates, who had been doing so well in school, have been retiring from the industry, and disappearing into the void.)</th>

<th>(There are some exceptions, like the super idol Hidaka Seiya, who continues to work in the industry to this day, but…)</th>

<th>(There’s a decline in the industry itself at this point, I think. Idols don’t last very long anymore, it seems.)</th>

<th>(Is everything really going to be alright when it’s like this…? Or has the idol industry become incapable of holding itself up…?)</th>

<th>(Ahh, it all just feels so disheartening…)</th>

<th>(No, no! Don’t think that way! You just have to keep trying to find the good things in life!)</th>

<th>(After all, I still have the stuntman job the previous captain introduced me to, so my own income is alright.)</th>

<th>(Although I’d hoped I could save up money through idol work instead… But that’s a little tricky right now.)</th>

<th>(The previous captain ended up going to the USA as planned, and someone did inherit the Captain role after him, but…)</th>

<th>(I don’t want to badmouth one of my own unit mates, but our current captain is the type who just tries to get through by sucking up to people.)</th>

<th>(He doesn’t seem like he intends to work properly as an idol — all he’s good at is cutting corners.)</th>

<th>(Mikejima-san has been appointed vice-captain, and for some reason, the captain pretends to work hard only when he’s around… other than that, he just plays around.)</th>

<th>(After we became second-years, Mikejima-san has been travelling overseas even more than before for some reason…)</th>

<th>(So whenever he’s not around, everyone starts doing whatever they want, like they’re trying to vent out their pent-up grudges.)</th>

<th>(Some members couldn’t even tolerate stopping themselves from messing around, so they’ve been transferring to Chess instead, where everyone messes around all the time, whenever they feel like.)</th>

<th>(Ryuseitai is losing both value and people.)</th>

<th>(I do want to stop this, but nothing I say has any influence. I feel like they start to treat me even worse, instead.)</th>
{% endbubble %}
{% img /img/es/eventstory/meteorimpact/secondhalfch1_1.jpg %}
{% bubble ChiakiPast %}
<th>(But I can’t complain at all… Last year, when everyone got serious for a while… apparently, that was because of my “wish”.)</th>

<th>(Apparently, to grant my wish, Shinkai-kun got Mikejima-san involved, since he was already in Ryuseitai… and that’s how the unit turned out the way it did last year.)</th>

<th>(Yeah, that makes sense… Not only the previous captain, but everyone else had suddenly changed their attitudes, too. Like it was magic… Like a miracle…)</th>

<th>(It all happened because that’s what that kid called “God” wanted.)</th>

<th>(I asked Mikejima-san to tell Shinkai-kun to stop doing anything like that anymore, so…)</th>

<th>(It would only be absurd to “wish” for the same thing yet again.)</th>

<th>(Threatening the lazy members to force them to work hard would be awful, anyway…)</th>

<th>(It is frustrating, and it is lonely, but I have no other choice… Enough relying on other people — I’ll do what I can by myself.)</th>

<th>(I’ll never wish for anything ever again.)</th>

<th>(This world has no room for daydreams, so I just have to do what I can, as hard as I can.)</th>

<th>(That would be enough, wouldn’t it, Mikejima-san?)</th>

<th>(Shinkai-kun… You may think it’s unfortunate that you couldn’t get me to wish for something—)</th>

<th>(And if that would make you sad, then I do feel a little bad refusing to do so, but—)</th>

<th>(I’m really sorry. I don’t think I could protect your smile.)</th>

{% bubble Subaru %}
Heey~

Sorry, but you’re in my way, so~ Move, Morisenpai.

{% endbubble %}
{% bubble ChiakiPast %}
Woah—! Oh, Akehoshi-kun! Hello! I’ve told you this so many times by now, but it’s not “Mori”, I’m *Morisawa*!

{% endbubble %}
{% bubble Subaru %}
Oh, right. Sorry, sorry, I just call anyone I’m not interested in whatever comes to mind.

{% endbubble %}
{% bubble ChiakiPast %}
No interest!? That’s mean!

Ah, but Senpai thinks your honesty is a good thing! Let me praise you, come on over, c’mon, c’mon… ♪

{% endbubble %}
{% bubble Subaru %}
Don’t call me over like a dog. You really are a weirdo, Morisenpai…

{% endbubble %}
{% bubble ChiakiPast %}
Like I said, I’m Morisaw—oh well… Anyway, is there something I can do for you?

Do you get anxious if you don’t see me at least once a day? Ooh, you little~♪

{% endbubble %}
{% bubble Subaru %}
Nope, not one bit. I’m just here to check if there’s any job offers. Are you doing the same thing, Senpai?

{% endbubble %}
{% bubble ChiakiPast %}
Yup! But as you can see, the number of them is decreasing.

{% endbubble %}
{% bubble Subaru %}
Oh, is that so… Ahh, that puts me in a bind~ I mean, all I’ve been doing is solo activity lately.

But since the in-school jobs are based on that “DreamFes” thing, I can’t get any of them as a solo idol anymore.

{% endbubble %}
{% bubble ChiakiPast %}
Hm. So you aren’t part of a unit? Then how about Ryuseitai? You’re always welcome with open arms!

{% endbubble %}
{% bubble Subaru %}
Ehh~ Isn’t your unit just a bunch of lazy bums?

Everyone in a unit gets equally rewarded, so I bet they’d just mooch off of all my hard work.

I don’t see the point in teaming up with people if it’s going to be that way. Me and my mom’re in a rough spot financially right now; I wanna make as much money as I can.

If I don’t start making money, my mom’ll have to work harder than she can handle.

{% endbubble %}
{% bubble ChiakiPast %}
I see… That must be rough. If you’re alright with doing stunt work, I could introduce you to the place I work at; how about it?

{% endbubble %}
{% bubble Subaru %}
Mrm, nah… I wanna make my way in life as an idol.

I mean, I won’t have any other choice if my situation gets bad enough, but~ I can make do with solo work at the moment.

So don’t worry about it. ‘Kay, I’ll see ya later~ Just spotted a nice job, so I’m gonna head over there and check it out.

{% endbubble %}
{% bubble ChiakiPast %}
Ooh, you’ve got keen eyesight! You could become a great basketball player! Come visit the basketball club sometime, Akehoshi-kun.

{% endbubble %}
{% bubble Subaru %}
Yeah, if I feel like it~ Bye bye now, *Morisawasenpai*!

{% endbubble %}
{% bubble ChiakiPast %}
<th>(Oh! He called me by my name. The way he said it sounded weird, though…)</th>

<th>(He’s usually cold and distant, like a wild animal… But he still listens to what I say.)</th>

<th>(Ahh, it makes me happy~ Juniors are so nice to have…)</th>

<th>(Aaalright! I’m going to work hard too, so I can become a proud senior! ♪)</th>

<th>(Hang in there! Don’t lose now, Morisawa Chiaki!)</th>

## Chapter 2
{% note location %}
**Location:** Gym
{% endnote %}
{% img /img/es/eventstory/meteorimpact/secondhalfch2.jpg %}
{% note narration %}
**Time:** Same day, after classes
{% endnote %}

{% bubble ChiakiPast %}
Bam! Take this! Finishing move: Super Chiaki Shoot…!! ☆

*Heh*… One point for me! Justice always prevails!
{% endbubble %}
{% bubble Subaru %}
… Huh, you talk to yourself a lot, *Morisawasenpai.*

{% endbubble %}
{% bubble ChiakiPast %}
Eeek!? D-d-d-don’t scare me like that, Akehoshi-kun! When did you get here!? It’s rude to sneak up behind people! I thought I was going to die!

{% endbubble %}
{% bubble Subaru %}
Hm\~? Dying from shock? Are you a little animal or somethin’~?

Hehe, it’s all good, though. It’s cute.

{% endbubble %}
{% bubble ChiakiPast %}
Hrmph! How could you say “cute” to your *senior*!? You’re so cheeky! But I guess you’re complimenting me, so in a sense, thank you!

Anyway… What’s wrong? Are you going to join club activities today? Didn’t you say you found a job earlier today, though…?

{% endbubble %}
{% bubble Subaru %}
Whaa~ You’re the one who told me to show up sometimes.

… I rejected the job offer after learning the details.

{% endbubble %}
{% bubble ChiakiPast %}
R-Really? Why is that? Did they say something bad to you!? You poor thing! Let me make you feel better!

{% endbubble %}
{% bubble Subaru %}
Nope. When I went there, they asked me to be the substitute for someone I dunno~ I mean, it would’ve been fine if it were something similar to a pinch hitter, but—

I wasn’t *just* gonna be said person’s substitute, they wanted me to work in the “background”—Basically, they wanted me to hide my face in a radio show and imitate his voice… Like, they were asking for way too much.

Well, technically I *can* do that, since the person in question is a pretty famous idol, and I more or less get how his character works, but…

{% endbubble %}
{% bubble ChiakiPast %}
Hm. I’m only asking out of curiosity, but who may you be referring to?

You don’t have to tell me if it’s confidential, but — I feel like I’ve heard something like this before, so I’m sort of curious.

If I remember clearly, he’s a famous idol who works solo, and goes by the name Hi… Hi-something[^1], wasn’t it…?

{% endbubble %}
{% bubble Subaru %}
Hrmm, they did tell me to keep it secret, but… I didn’t sign a contract or anything, so I guess it’s okay to tell you…

Or maybe not, since it may affect his reputation… I’m gonna keep it to myself.

{% endbubble %}
{% bubble ChiakiPast %}
Alright then. You respect people’s reputation, huh? I’m proud of you for being so considerate~♪

{% endbubble %}
{% bubble Subaru %}
Umm, it doesn’t make me happy being complimented by *you*~…

Anyways. Now that I’ve got free time, I figured I could come over to the club to kill some time.

I didn’t bring my P.E. uniform, though. If you have a spare with you, could you let me borrow it?

{% endbubble %}
{% bubble ChiakiPast %}
Oh! I’ve got something great for that! I was just planning to change myself! You see, we have uniforms for practicing!

Which number would you like? You can choose any of them! Ah—but I’m not handing over number four, okay!?[^2]

{% endbubble %}
{% bubble Subaru %}
I don’t mind anything~ … So there were practice uniforms? Is that normal for a basketball club? I’m a beginner, so I dunno much.

{% endbubble %}
{% bubble ChiakiPast %}
No, it’s pretty rare. Usually you only wear a uniform during a match.

But since this is a basketball club in an idol school, there was once a time when a magazine company wanted to take candid shots for an article, so…

Now we have practice uniforms—or, well, uniforms for photos.

{% endbubble %}
{% bubble Subaru %}
Ahh, I see, the photos wouldn’t be good enough in P.E. uniforms, yeah? It’s actually pretty hard to tell this is a basketball club without someone at least holding the ball.

{% endbubble %}
{% bubble ChiakiPast %}
Exactly! You’re really smart, Akehoshi-kun! You understand things so well, it’s wonderful~♪

{% endbubble %}
{% bubble Subaru %}
I feel like you praise me over just about anything… It’s super overbearing, like you’re making fun of me instead.

{% endbubble %}
{% bubble ChiakiPast %}
That’s not my intention at all~! … I’ve never once been praised by my seniors, so I thought to make sure to pour all my love into my juniors once I had my own!

{% endbubble %}
{% bubble Subaru %}
Hmm~ So you’ve always been a useless one, Senpai?

{% endbubble %}
{% bubble ChiakiPast %}
I’m not useless, though!? No, actually, the “always” part is what hurts! I mean, regardless of how I may had been in the past, I’ve at least grown splendidly now!

C’mon, c’mon~! Look at my wonderfully built abs…☆

{% endbubble %}
{% bubble Subaru %}
Huh!? Why’re you stripping!? I’ll call the police!

{% endbubble %}
{% bubble ChiakiPast %}
Please don’t! I said I’d change my clothes, didn’t I!?

You went too far with that joke; Senpai would love a kid who’s much more honest and attached to them, y’know!?

{% endbubble %}
{% bubble Subaru %}
I don’t wanna be loved by you, anyway\~ … But alright, maybe I was a little too mean. Sorry, sorry\~ It’s just becoming so much fun to tease you~♪

**Time:** Few hours later
{% endnote %}
{% bubble ChiakiPast %}
Aaalright! Time to head home, Akehoshi-kun!

Let’s check if it’s safe! Right’s all clear! Left’s all clear! All is clear! Here we gooo~! ☆

{% endbubble %}
{% bubble Subaru %}
Umm~… You don’t have to walk me back home, y’know. I told you before — My house isn’t that far away.

{% endbubble %}
{% bubble ChiakiPast %}
No! Let me walk you back home, please! I’ve yearned to do something like this as a senior…! Thank you, Akehoshi-kun! You always make my dreams come true~♪

{% endbubble %}
{% bubble Subaru %}
*Huh*? You were talking to me much more politely just a second ago; why’d you suddenly start being more casual?[^3]

Don’t start shortening the distance between us for no reason~ It’s *way* too friendly, like you think you’re above me or something — It annoys me!

{% endbubble %}
{% bubble ChiakiPast %}
Huh? I’m sorry! I thought talking to you that way made me seem cold, like we don’t know each other…!

{% endbubble %}
{% bubble Subaru %}
We *don’t*. But whatever~ Do as you like.

{% endbubble %}
{% bubble ChiakiPast %}
Mhm, I will\~! It’s dangerous to walk at night, so we’ll go home together\~! C’mon, c’mon! Let’s walk while holding hands~♪

{% endbubble %}
{% bubble Subaru %}
I didn’t say you could do *that*! Stay, stay! You’re so overbearing, oh my *God*…!
{% endbubble %}
{% img /img/es/eventstory/meteorimpact/secondhalfch3_1.jpg %}

{% bubble Subaru %}
… Senpai, did you…

About me—no, about my dad[^4], you—…

No, nevermind.

{% endbubble %}
{% bubble ChiakiPast %}
Hm? What’s wrong? If there’s anything you want to say, go ahead and say it!

I’m still new to being a senior to someone, so I’m sure I’m far from perfect as one! I’ll fix anything you point out to me!

{% endbubble %}
{% bubble Subaru %}
Mm~ Shouldn’t you say that to the juniors in your unit, instead?

{% endbubble %}
{% bubble ChiakiPast %}
Ah, no… No first years joined our unit this year.

Ryuseitai has a long history, and thanks to its old-fashioned camaraderie, the unit became a bit reclusive.

And, well, it’s gotten even worse this year.

The new captain is the type to be satisfied by just having fun with like-minded people. He hasn’t bothered to scout new members, and even drives away anyone he can’t stand.

{% endbubble %}
{% bubble Subaru %}
Woah! What kinda hell is that…!? It doesn’t suit you at all! Why’re you sticking around in a place like that? There’s no way you agree with that, right?

{% endbubble %}
{% bubble ChiakiPast %}
Yeah… Honestly, I’ve often considered transferring to a different unit, or maybe just leaving units altogether and working solo, but… I can’t get myself to entirely give up on the whole unit…

Ryuseitai is my exact ideal image, since originally its concept was to be both idols and heroes.

Also, maybe the previous captain was just being nice, but he encouraged me. His words to me were: “I leave the rest to you,” and “hang in there.”

And then he told me, “become a great hero.” He patted me on the back and head, and I guess he must’ve been weirdly energetic that day, because then, for once, he hugged me.

Right at that moment, I felt like I had inherited the spirit of Ryuseitai—the very first idol unit to have been established in Yumenosaki Academy—

Like I inherited the burning, passionate spirit of justice. … Ryuseitai is corrupted right now, no doubt about it. But the lazy members who do as they please are all third years.

Once they graduate… The next captain will be Mikejima-san, if we’re looking at who has the skills for it.

I don’t really understand him very well, and he’s kind of terrifying, but he does his job well, has a good reputation overseas, and has a record of his accomplishments.

We’ll make him the next captain, and then we’ll do as best as we can to support him, and… If we work hard, I’m sure Ryuseitai will be reborn. Next year’s when the real game begins—no, that’s when it’ll be our turn!

That’s what I believe in. There’s hope for the future, so I can bear with anything that comes my way!

{% endbubble %}
{% bubble Subaru %}
Hmmm. I feel like you’re avoiding the real problem here, or like, you’re trying to come up with excuses.

I mean, all I hear about Ryuseitai is bad news. If things don’t go well, the school’s staff might have their eyes on you, or the unit’ll be demolished by next year, or something.

{% endbubble %}
{% bubble ChiakiPast %}
Don’t say such terrifying things… It’ll be just fine. No—I’ll make sure that doesn’t happen. I promise you: I *will* protect Ryuseitai.

{% endbubble %}
{% bubble Subaru %}
I don’t think there’s much point to promising *me* that, but… Well, do as you like. It’s your life, Senpai.

… Hey, if Ryuseitai really is reborn next year… and if you’re still up for that offer by then, and I still haven’t been able to do any work except solo…

Invite me then, okay? I might agree to join if anything like that were to happen.

{% endbubble %}
{% bubble ChiakiPast %}
Oh!? Got it! That’s our promise to each other! Believe in me, Akehoshi-kun! A hero never breaks his promise with a kid!

{% endbubble %}
{% bubble Subaru %}
Huuuh? When did *you* become a hero, *Morisawasenpai*?

Also, don’t tell me the “kid” is me. We’re only a year apart, ‘kay? Gosh, you act so high and mighty…

… But that’s okay. If only a hero really had existed when I was in the worst time of my life…

… Hm?

{% endbubble %}
{% bubble ChiakiPast %}
? What’s wrong?

{% endbubble %}
{% bubble Subaru %}
Uh… Look up there, Senpai. Is it just me, or is it a little too bright up on the roof? I thought there was a fire for a second there.

{% endbubble %}
{% bubble ChiakiPast %}
Hmm? You have such keen eyesight, Akehoshi-kun! And your attentiveness is incredible! You really do have what it takes to be an excellent basketball pla—Wait, what?

<th>(Ooh? What are those people wearing our school uniform doing on the rooftop? Are they waving light sticks…?)</th>

<th>(Is there a live show happening? No, wait, but… I don’t think anyone is allowed on the rooftop late at night, so…?)</th>

{% endbubble %}
{% bubble Subaru %}
Ahh~ Is that the rumored “Yaobikuni”…? This is the first time I’ve seen them.

{% endbubble %}
{% bubble ChiakiPast %}
Y-Yaobikuni? The legendary story about eating mermaid flesh and becoming immortal?

{% endbubble %}
{% bubble Subaru %}
Ah, no, I don’t actually know what it’s about. It’s just the rumor recently, I think. Sakasaki-kun’s in my class, see—He knows a lot about weird stuff like that.

He’s one of the few friends I have that I can casually talk to, so we have chats sometimes.

That’s when he told me that there’s an illegal circle called “Yaobikuni” in our school.

I dunno how much of it is true, but apparently they’re a religious cult or some secret group.

What was his name again…? Ah! Someone called “Shin kai ka na ta” is acting as the founder of the group.

{% endbubble %}
{% bubble ChiakiPast %}
Huh!? Shinkai-kun is the…!?

{% endbubble %}
{% bubble Subaru %}
Oh? Do you know him? Yeah, he’s that… What was it, Five Eccentrics?

He’s one of the people who’re called by that name — They’re the most excellent, outstanding idols in this school, yeah~?

Well, the Five Eccentrics are just outstanding idols — I doubt any of them are actually cult leaders, or Gods, or whatever…

Buuut, those are the kinda rumors you hear.

People talking about how it’s totally true that that “Shin kai ka na ta” guy will grant any of your wishes.

……

<th>(… Yeah, there’s definitely signs that a huge number of people have been conducting secret meetings here. What I witnessed a few days ago was no illusion or dream.)</th>

<th>(It doesn’t give off the sense that it’s been used as a gathering place for delinquents, either. Although unfortunately, there *are* people like that in this school.)</th>

<th>(I’m already aware of that, since they always throw litter all over the ground. I couldn’t stand seeing the place littered, so I typically clean this area.)</th>

<th>(But, those “Yaobikuni” people… Something feels off about them.)</th>

<th>(No one is supposed to go to the rooftop of the academy, which may be why it’s starting to look a bit dirty around here. This also means footsteps are left behind.)</th>

<th>(Yet, these people have been wiping their traces off the ground before leaving.)</th>

<th>(But the fact that the ground is so clean next to everything else *is* what makes it so obviously unnatural.)</th>

<th>(There's even a sweet lingering scent left behind.)</th>

<th>(It doesn’t smell like candy or juice, so what is it… Incense sticks, maybe? It can’t be tobacco—Maybe it’s musk?)</th>

<th>(It makes me think of those aromas used for religious purposes!)</th>

<th>(It’s just too suspicious! What’s going on? Who are these Yaobikuni people?)</th>

<th>(What are they doing in the corners of our school?)</th>

<th>(Is Shinkai-kun really acting as their founder…?)</th>

<th>(Why? How did that happen? I don’t understand, and that makes me feel all the more uneasy!)</th>

<th>(……)</th>

<th>(… What am I even doing…? No one asked me to do this, yet I’m acting like a detective just because I’m a little curious.)</th>

<th>(Mikejima-san even warned me to not get involved—to not dig any deeper into this…)</th>

<th>(And I doubt me of all people could ever make a difference simply by fumbling around.)</th>

<th>(But… I just can’t help wondering what’s going on. I can’t get myself to overlook this.)</th>

<th>(Mikejima-san… I also think it’s terrible that a human being is being pushed into the role of a God.)</th>

<th>(This may be unnecessary of me, and maybe this is just me being foolish, and having a narrow-minded point of view…)</th>

<th>(And maybe what I’m doing right now is just me trying to look cool, like a middle schooler playing the hero role, but…)</th>[^5]

<th>(But still, I—)</th>

<th>(… Hm? Over there, in the far corner…)</th>

<th>(That person in the garden… Isn’t that Shinkai-kun?)</th>

<th>(I ended up in a different class from him this year, too. After what happened last year, I felt like I had to avoid him, and haven’t talked to him since…)</th>

<th>(Which is just proof that I don’t know a single thing about what he’s been going through, or what he’s thinking, but…)</th>

<th>(I should still go talk to him — I can ask him everything I want to know… Mikejima-san may get angry at me for this, but I want to do it.)</th>

<th>(That kid granted my wishes, like a shooting star. It was all nothing but lies and fabrication[^6] done by his worshippers, but…)</th>

<th>(I still would like to repay his kindness. If he’s suffering from something, then I want to save him.)</th>

<th>(All I did was spray some water at him, and be a little nice to him… Yet he laughed so innocently, like it was the very first time he’s ever had someone do that for him.)</th>

{% bubble KanataPast %}
yes? what is it, shu?

that was your Name, right? you have a Name, all of you! hehehe~…♪

and so! because my Name is shinkai kanata, you called me “Kanata”, yes? am i right?

{% endbubble %}
{% bubble Shu %}
Yes, you’re correct. However, I still don’t understand what you’re trying to say.

It is painfully clear to me that you have had quite a unique lifestyle for half of your lifetime, but how does that have anything to do with me? I don’t see where this conversation is heading.

{% endbubble %}
{% bubble KanataPast %}
huh? it is Painful for you? shall i cure you? curing is my Weakest point, though…?

ah! i heard Mermaid flesh works for all kinds of Diseases! how about you try eating me~? ♪

{% endbubble %}
{% bubble Shu %}
I have no interest in cannibalism! *Non*! I feel like puking just by the thought!

{% endbubble %}
{% bubble KanataPast %}
puking…? so not only is it Painful for you, but it is making you feel Disgusted…? are you Feeling ill?

## Chapter 5

{% bubble Shu %}
Kanata. I will try my best to allow the lot of you to do as you please—or rather, I’ve come to understand just through our very short acquaintanceship, that anything I say to any of you is futile.

However, as you can see, I am currently sewing.

I am not so amateur that a gaze would interfere with the quality of my work, but frankly speaking… You are being an eyesore.

{% endbubble %}
{% bubble KanataPast %}
an eyesore? that is Not good, there may be a Possibility that even your Eyes are not Feeling well! you have many Diseases all over your body, don’t you, shu?

{% endbubble %}
{% bubble Shu %}
Are you doing this on purpose, is that it? Are you *trying* to provoke me?

{% endbubble %}
{% bubble KanataPast %}
on purpose? about what? hmm… the Things shu says are difficult~

{% endbubble %}
{% bubble Shu %}
People often say that about me. However, you are different from the ordinary masses, are you not? You are intelligent enough to comprehend the meaning behind my words, correct?

Surely you must, as you are of equal rank to me… as we are both part of the Five Eccentrics, the name that was pushed onto us by the masses—yes?

{% endbubble %}
{% bubble KanataPast %}
yes. to be part of something together means that we are the same, right?

hehehe. it makes me Happy to share something in Common…♪

{% endbubble %}
{% bubble Shu %}
I am not the least bit happy about it. I, Itsuki Shu, am at the top of all creations—a transcendence that no other may stand next to.

Being grouped with four more people for being similar makes me feel like my worth among the mass is underestimated. It is unpleasant.

Especially you—You act so high and mighty.

Usually, it is that nagging Wataru and Rei that make idle talk, so the two of us rarely ever speak one on one, like we are doing right now.

But everytime you speak, you start spouting things about being a God, that you grant wishes, or what-have-you… Who do you think you are? Do you think you’re a savior of some sort—that you have been dispatched by the high heavens to rescue all living things?

{% endbubble %}
{% bubble KanataPast %}
hm? it is not the Heavens that i come from~ it is the Sea! also, i am not a Savior, but a God♪

because i am a God, i grant Wishes! shu, what is your Wish?

{% endbubble %}
{% bubble Shu %}
… You really aren’t listening to me at all, are you?

You’ll grant my wish? *Ha*! Don’t make me laugh! That’s something one only says to those they think are below them. Are you trying to say that you are *above* me?

{% endbubble %}
{% bubble KanataPast %}
hm~? are Humans not generally Below me? which is why i can watch over them from Above, and Help them…?

{% endbubble %}
{% bubble Shu %}
… I will skip past the nerve you hit just now — I simply pity you at this point. I will make this very clear to you: I do not plan to have faith in anyone but myself.

I suppose if I *must* specify something, then I do have a longing towards muses.

However, that description is more suitable to someone such as Nito — You, on the other hand, would be more comparable to a siren, no?

{% endbubble %}
{% bubble KanataPast %}
psy…che…?[^7]

{% endbubble %}
{% bubble Shu %}
Not psyche, *siren*. It may only be folktale, but they are said to be mermaids.

Muses and sirens may be mythical creatures related to water, but sirens are monsters—far different from my beloved muses.[^8]

{% endbubble %}
{% bubble KanataPast %}
i am… not a Monster, you know…?

{% endbubble %}
{% bubble Shu %}
… Such an unbearably sad face you’re making. I cannot tell where your discomforts lie at all. Perhaps that was not the right word choice, I suppose I’ll withdraw what I said.

{% endbubble %}
{% bubble KanataPast %}
okay. you are Unexpectedly kiー

… hm?

{% endbubble %}
{% bubble Shu %}
? What’s wrong? Have those insolent, belated people who called for us finally arrived? I mean the other Eccentrics, of course.

**Time:** Next day, after classes
{% endnote %}
{% bubble KuroPast smile %}
—And that’s all I’ve got to report. What’s your next move, Bocchan?

{% endbubble %}
{% bubble KeitoPast %}
First, stop calling me that. You switched to a different name for a while, but now you’re back to the first one for some reason.

How incorrigible. I suppose that’s meant to be a nickname, but I just feel like you’re making a fool of me instead. I don’t particularly like it.

{% endbubble %}
{% bubble KuroPast smile %}
Haha, then what should I call ya? Vice-prez? Kei-chan?

{% endbubble %}
{% bubble KeitoPast %}
Call me whatever you like. I’m already asking a huge favor from you for this plan, so I prefer to respect your free will to some extent.

Do be aware that I’m not trying to control you, but rather trying to let you make use of the Student Council as you please.

{% endbubble %}
{% bubble KuroPast smile %}
Hmmm. And what can this newborn, shabby-lookin’ Student Council even do for me, eh?

{% endbubble %}
{% bubble KeitoPast %}
What I can offer you for now is authority. If I make everything that you’re doing part of the Student Council’s duties, then it will become a part of justice.

And it’s unlikely that you will misuse what is labeled as “justice,” correct? I trust you on that part.

Or rather, it’s *because* I know you won’t that I’m trying to take advantage of your good, sensible mind, and restrain your movement.

{% endbubble %}
{% bubble KuroPast smile %}
Haha. You sure you wanna tell me all about your ulterior motives?

{% endbubble %}
{% bubble KeitoPast %}
Based on everything I know about you, I’ve concluded that the best way to ask for your help is to tell you my real intentions from the start, rather than trick you into helping me.

We may end up being together for a long while, after all. I’m looking at the wider picture here, since I’d like to properly advance my plans according to what will become useful in the long run.

I just need to win the game by the end. Perseverance is what prevails, and that’s why I’ve been building up my assets slowly, but surely.

<th>(However, as for Eichi… He doesn’t know how long he has left to live, due to his weak constitution… Thus, he may be appalled by how I’m taking my sweet time with this plan. Actually—He might even curse at me for it.)</th>

<th>(Still, I won’t be able to make any real progress by rushing the plan—I’m only human, after all.)</th>

<th>(I would be left with nothing in my hands, and all of it would go to waste.)</th>

<th>(That’s what I learnt after what happened with Sakuma-san.)</th>

<th>(Don’t rush, don’t panic… Take deep breaths in between…♪)</th>

{% endbubble %}
{% img /img/es/eventstory/meteorimpact/secondhalfch6_1.jpg %}
{% bubble SoumaPast %}
Forgive me for intruding. Hasumi-dono, could you permit me to speak?

{% endbubble %}
{% bubble KeitoPast %}
…!? Ahh, you surprised me! You were here, Kanzaki!?

{% endbubble %}
{% bubble SoumaPast %}
Yes, I have been here from the start. I believe that Kiryu-dono was aware of my presence…

However, you both appeared to be speaking very earnestly about something, so I did not wish to intrude, and refrained from expressing my thoughts.

{% endbubble %}
{% bubble KuroPast smile %}
Haha, I was wonderin’ why you were ignorin’ him… So you didn’t even realize he was there, *Hasumi*?

{% endbubble %}
{% bubble KeitoPast %}
So you’re going to call me by my family name? Fine, so be it… Anyhow, Kanzaki — You’re a member of Akatsuki, too. You don’t need to constantly ask for permission to speak.

We are equal in this unit. Rather, *all* human beings are meant to be equal to each other. There is no need to speak to me in a formal manner, like you’re a samurai serving your lord.

{% endbubble %}
{% bubble SoumaPast %}
… I see. It appears that I have actually been disrespectful through my asking for permission. I apologize. But I also cannot help it; I am not used to acting as a group.

More importantly, I wish to inquire about the mysterious group that Kiryu-dono has informed us of, the “Yaobikuni”.

{% endbubble %}
{% bubble KeitoPast %}
Ahh, are you also curious about it? It didn’t seem to be a mere superstition…

Thus, I asked Kiryu to investigate what’s been happening, as he has connections with the delinquents in this academy.

{% endbubble %}
{% bubble KuroPast smile %}
Ah, yeah. Sometimes I ask for some stuff from shady jobs, though those jobs have also become a part-time thing within school.

So yeah, I’d have more connections with those shady guys than you, the goodie-two-shoes honor student.

… If Akatsuki and the Student Council are meant to be “justice,” then should I cut my ties with those guys?

My history with them might end up being a weak point to target for the Student Council, y’know?

{% endbubble %}
{% bubble KeitoPast %}
No, it’s alright. That would be far too unnecessary.

{% endbubble %}
{% bubble KuroPast smile %}
Haha, alright, but if that ever happens, you can throw away the punks, includin’ me.

{% endbubble %}
{% bubble KeitoPast %}
I have *no* plans to do that. Besides, the dark and light of this world are blended with each other.

I’m not so happy-go-lucky that I would dream of an ideal paradise where all evil has been extinguished. I’m not a kid, you know.

I—*We* need you. I’ve lived all my life in an upstanding manner, and that’s exactly why I need someone like you, who can reach those places I’m not well-acquainted with, and can’t reach on my own.

{% endbubble %}
{% bubble KuroPast smile %}
That so? Well, being needed doesn’t feel so bad. I appreciate it, makes me wanna cry a li’l bit.

{% endbubble %}
{% bubble SoumaPast %}
Hehe, so even demons[^9] shed tears. Though, I do admit that your discussion right now was a little too difficult for me to comprehend.

{% endbubble %}
{% bubble KeitoPast %}
Don’t think about it too much, it’s only small talk. That aside—You’re interested in the Yaobikuni, Kanzaki? Don’t tell me you’re also a worshipper.

{% endbubble %}
{% bubble SoumaPast %}
Mm, a “worshipper”? Is this “Yaobikuni” related to a religion of some sort?

{% endbubble %}
{% bubble KuroPast smile %}
Seems like it. It ain’t an officially recognized group in school or anythin’; it sounds like it’s some kinda network that somehow just came to be.

## Chapter 7
{% note cw %}
**Content Warning:** Mentions of violence ahead.
{% endnote %}
{% img /img/es/eventstory/meteorimpact/secondhalfch7.jpg %}

{% bubble KeitoPast %}
Yes. You see, the Yaobikuni don’t appear to have proper headquarters of any sort.

They are simply a large society, keeping in contact with each other for essential information, done through encrypted text messages.

There seems to be no need to perform a ritual, nor pay a fee to join the group.

I’m sure there must be people who aren’t even aware that they’re part of the Yaobikuni due to this.

{% endbubble %}
{% bubble SoumaPast %}
Hmm… It is like trying to grasp a cloud.

{% endbubble %}
{% bubble KeitoPast %}
Exactly. There does appear to be someone at the center of the group who is currently acting as the religious founder for them, but…

He doesn’t seem to have any intention of creating or managing the organization.

It seems to be nothing but the group simply prancing around him however they please.

They don't seem to be doing anything terrible at the moment—the only exceptions are the fervent ones trespassing onto the school rooftop, but that's a trivial violation.

So we *could* just leave them aside for now, but—

They’re starting to grow much too large to ignore, and their bizarre and illogical movements make me uneasy.

I don’t particularly like how it feels like the academy is being slowly taken over by an unknown group of people.

… Cursed cult. They’re so infuriating — Our modern society doesn’t need any religions.

{% endbubble %}
{% bubble KuroPast smile %}
Haha, you’re one to talk, Mr. “I’m the son of a temple”.

{% endbubble %}
{% bubble KeitoPast %}
I’m saying this *because* I am one. I know how frightening religions can be. Though for now, it appears to be nothing but a substitute for one—a secret “good luck charm”, if you will.

But, at worst, this may become a large obstruction in our path. After all, the ones the student body should trust is us, the Student Council.

… Maybe I *should* nip the bud before it sprouts a disaster…

{% endbubble %}
{% bubble KuroPast smile %}
How, though? We’ve got no real authority to do that — You gonna try and change the rules to ban believin’ in religious faith in school?

{% endbubble %}
{% bubble KeitoPast %}
No, students should be free to have faith as they please. Also, the Student Council has an insignificant amount of authority, so we won’t get anywhere trying to change the school rules.

Everyone would simply ignore them, and it would be all over for us.

There is no point trying to provoke the worshippers without planning beforehand.

{% endbubble %}
{% bubble KuroPast smile %}
That’s gonna be annoyin’, then… Can’t we just beat up the bad guy and get this done and over with?

… Nah, we can’t, can we… Nothin’s that simple.

{% endbubble %}
{% bubble KeitoPast %}

… Kiryu? What’s wrong? Are you feeling ill?

Sorry. I keep asking far too much of you.

{% endbubble %}
{% bubble KuroPast smile %}
*Huh?* Don’t act like we’re strangers here. I would'a told you by now if this was too much for me, anyway. I’m helpin’ ya ‘cuz I *want* to, aight? You lookin’ down on me or somethin’?

{% endbubble %}
{% bubble SoumaPast %}
Yes. I feel the same as Kiryu-dono — there is no need for you to be concerned. It would not be an apology, but rather an insult, Hasumi-dono.

In any case, I would like to propose an idea.

Would you please entrust this “Yaobikuni” matter to me? I, Kanzaki Souma, shall handle it.

{% endbubble %}
{% bubble KeitoPast %}
… Entrust it to you?

{% endbubble %}
{% bubble KuroPast smile %}
Oh? Got an idea or somethin’, Kanzaki?

I don’t feel like there’s much anyone could do about this vague problem of ours, but — did you get a breakthrough to solvin’ it or somethin’?

{% endbubble %}
{% bubble SoumaPast %}
Ah, no. I am uncertain whether I will be capable of resolving the issue or not. It is merely that I have ties to the founder of that “Yaobikuni” group.

{% endbubble %}
{% bubble KeitoPast %}
Founder… *You* know Shinkai Kanata of the Five Eccentrics!?

{% endbubble %}
{% bubble SoumaPast %}
Indeed. My interpersonal interactions with him are almost nonexistent, but as our families are connected, I do know a little about him.

The things I have heard about him were a bit too different from what my parents have told me, so I have only just made the connection now.

I know the person called Shinkai Kanata.

I hold a different perspective than the one you two hold, and therefore I may be able to solve the issue… that is what I am thinking. According to all of our ancestors, a thief is required to catch a thief, correct?

<th>(……)</th>

<th>(My worst nightmare came true. Those “Yaobikuni” people really are what I vaguely assumed them to be.)</th>

<th>(To this day, Shinkai-kun is still granting wishes.)</th>

<th>(He listens to other people’s wishes by talking to them, just like he did with me — and always makes sure to grant each and every one of them.)</th>

<th>(Be it through fair choice or random choice, he will do it… and nothing can stop him from doing so.)</th>

<th>(He keeps on going from one wish to another, no matter who it is.)</th>

<th>(Any wishes that he himself can grant would be done on the spot… For instance, wishing to be patted on the head.)</th>

<th>(When they can’t be achieved by him alone, many of his worshippers will be ready to act—)</th>

<th>(And use any means necessary to grant those wishes.)</th>

<th>(Getting a strict teacher fired for warning a student, taking down a fast food restaurant because they didn’t like how a cashier spoke to them—)</th>

<th>(Driving a kid home specifically through an expensive car because he missed the last train, buying and then giving away multiple copies of a new game console on the same day it releases…)</th>

<th>(I only searched around a little, and still managed to find plenty of stories.)</th>

<th>(I don’t think anybody was warned to keep it a secret, because there are all kinds of stories spread around on public social media accounts.)</th>

<th>(Once people hear about those rumors, they start getting curious about these wishes… and some have a prayer in their heart beforehand, leading them to tell their wishes to Shinkai-kun.)</th>

<th>(Even the people who laughed at the thought of someone being capable of doing this started to change their minds once they saw those wishes come true.)</th>

<th>(Nobody can stop themselves from wishing for more… and it keeps piling up.)</th>

<th>(And with every type of wish being granted, nobody wants to try working hard on their own—they’re all starting to believe that life is easier when you make a wish to Shinkai-kun.)</th>

<th>(They become hollow versions of themselves, and depend on him for everything. And that kept on repeating, until it got stronger, expanded further, until it formed into what you can only call a “religion”.)</th>

<th>(No… This religion existed within this region from the old times. They’re simply being taken in by those strange worshippers Mikejima-san was talking about.)</th>

<th>(Is that Shinkai-kun’s goal?)</th>

<th>(Is it to gain more worshippers, so that there are more people to worship him as a living God?)</th>

<th>(Shinkai-kun. Is that your true wish?)</th>

<th>(If so, then I don’t want to reject it. I can’t say I want to support it, but I at least don’t want to get in your way… But—)</th>

<th>(In a world that has no room for daydreams to exist, something coming true simply by wishing for it is too unnatural.)</th>

<th>(Every time that reality is ignored to grant a wish — In other words, every time someone gains something, someone else is losing something without reason.)</th>

<th>(Those who lose something will only bear a bitter grudge. They’ll try to find out how this happened, and they’ll find their way to Shinkai-kun.)</th>

<th>(And then, from their rage and need for revenge, they may hurt him.)</th>

<th>(… He hasn’t even done anything wrong. All he’s been doing is granting “wishes”…)</th>

Hahaha! Isn’t it obvious!? I’m running a yaki onigiri stall! I’m using a special secret soy sauce for it, and it’s suuuper tasty! Wanna buy one?

{% endbubble %}
{% bubble ChiakiPast %}
Why yaki onigiri…? I don’t understand, but — I’m a little hungry right now, so I’ll have one.

{% endbubble %}
{% bubble MadaraPast hidden %}
Thank you, come again! I was feeling a little lonely, y’know! I think everyone’s weirded out by a random stall right at the front gate or something, ‘cause they’ve been ignoring me entirely!

Yaki onigiri is so tasty, though~ I guess youngsters these days prefer hamburgers and stuff?

{% endbubble %}
{% bubble ChiakiPast %}
Hehe, I also like those types of fast food. Plus, you don’t see people sell onigiri in food stalls, do you?

{% endbubble %}
{% bubble MadaraPast hidden %}
Seriously? But it’s been Japan’s version of fast food for centuries now! Even sushi was sold like this back in the old days, y’know?

Oh well, guess no one’s familiar with that nowadays. I gotta keep up with the modern times too—especially now that we’ve become westernized since the Meiji era.

But anyway… I didn’t have any customers up until now, so I didn’t bother making any yaki onigiri yet… You’ll have to wait some time for yours.

{% endbubble %}
{% bubble ChiakiPast %}
Yeah, I’ll wait. No one is motivated to do anything in Ryuseitai when you aren’t around, so I don’t have practice nor work to do.

I have time to spare, so I can wait as long as it takes.

{% endbubble %}
{% bubble MadaraPast hidden %}
Oh? Alright then… How about we chat a little until it’s done roasting?

{% endbubble %}
{% bubble ChiakiPast %}
…?

{% endbubble %}
{% bubble MadaraPast hidden %}

We don’t know who could be watching us right now, so—Keep acting like you’re a passerby who’s just casually chatting with the storekeeper.

A-Alright. Yaaay~ I’m sooo excited for my yaki onigiri…♪

## Chapter 9
{% img /img/es/eventstory/meteorimpact/secondhalfch9.jpg %}

{% bubble MadaraPast hidden %}
Nah, this is an actual interest of mine, and I figured I could make a profit from it.

People overseas love authentic Japanese food, so sometimes I sell it while doing investigations.

I just figured I could call out to you, that’s all ⁠— It didn’t matter much to me if I couldn’t get to see you today.

Don’t think too deep on this, I’m honestly not expecting anything from you.

You may be good-natured, but you’re just an ordinary boy. I’m not gonna start depending on you for things like you’re some hero or God.

After all, it’s me who wished for you to just remain an ordinary boy, yeah?

I’m not gonna take back those words. Actually, I wanted to further state how you shouldn’t get yourself involved with what’s going on with Kanata-san.

{% endbubble %}
{% bubble ChiakiPast %}
……

{% endbubble %}
{% bubble MadaraPast hidden %}
Oh, but don’t get me wrong — I’m not taking you lightly at all. In fact, I’ve completely changed my opinion of you; I think very highly of you now.

… You were the only one.

{% endbubble %}
{% bubble ChiakiPast %}
…?

{% endbubble %}
{% bubble MadaraPast hidden %}
You were the only one who did as I said when I asked you not to wish for anything.

*And* you were the very first person who never spoke a word about any wish to Kanata-san, even after how he introduced himself to you.

I mean, even *I* wished for something once — for my sister’s disease to be cured.

Humans are weak. It’s normal for people to wish for something — to pray for some almighty being to make a miracle happen and make their lives better.

Even people who insist they’re atheists wish on shooting stars.

In a way, that just means there’s a part inside you that’s even stronger than I am… I’m almost jealous.

{% endbubble %}
{% bubble ChiakiPast %}
N-No, you’re wrong. I’m not strong at all, I’m just a coward.

It terrifies me to think that an unbelievable existence, like a God, could forcibly shake up everything I’ve ever known about this world, that’s all.

Even *I* wish for things. Deep in my heart, I have many fantasies I should be ashamed of.

Isn’t that why Shinkai-kun managed to guess what I subconsciously wished for, and grant them for me?

{% endbubble %}
{% bubble MadaraPast hidden %}
See, the key word here is that it was your *subconscious*. In reality, even after knowing he’s a God, you never once spoke a wish.

It wasn’t just because you were terrified of my warning… right?

I’ve threatened other people with the same warning, but they broke their promise and went back to clinging to “God” all over again.

They did it behind my back, thinking everything’d be fine as long as they aren’t caught.

Those kinds of people are only growing in number, so I think what I’ve been up to hasn't been pleasing Kanata-san and the more zealous worshippers…

‘Cause lately, I’m being forced to keep a distance from all this through overseas trips more than ever.

I haven’t been able to stop people from making wishes as much as I used to.

So yeah, all those people I warned could tell I was too powerless to stop them, and went right back to making wishes.

It’s pathetic of me, but I really can’t put a stop to what’s happening anymore.

{% endbubble %}
{% bubble ChiakiPast %}
… They haven’t been pleased with you, Mikejima-san? Is that why you’re always overseas?

{% endbubble %}
{% bubble MadaraPast hidden %}
Yep. I mean, I’m starting to find overseas work fun too, but this was the reason why at first.

It’s only natural this is happening; I’m a traitor to them. I’m the black sheep in the group that worships the all-knowing God Kanata-san.

While Kanata-san maintains his divinity by granting more and more wishes—

I’ve been telling every single person who finds out about him not to wish for anything.

They’re probably seeing it as me trying to kill off the God that has maintained their faith for so long.
{% endbubble %}
{% img /img/es/eventstory/meteorimpact/secondhalfch9_1.jpg %}

{% bubble MadaraPast hidden %}
Even Kanata-san told me off, y’know? He called me a traitor. An unfaithful, vulgar rogue.[^11]

{% endbubble %}
{% bubble ChiakiPast %}
That’s not true, though. Aren’t you the *only* person who’s been trying to protect him as a human being? You did it because he’s your friend—because you love him.

{% endbubble %}
{% bubble MadaraPast hidden %}
Nah… You’re reading me in good light, but I think I really am a traitor in the end.

That sweet-sounding talk I had with you, too — I bet it was just me putting up a front.

Maybe my real feelings toward Kanata-san are hatred, for constantly acting almighty and God-like—

Yet being unable to cure my sister, and I could only watch her suffer…

Maybe I got sick of seeing everyone be so happy, believing in that God…

And maybe I just wanna tear apart that fake charade, and laugh at them and their shocked expressions once they find out the truth.

That’s who I really am, Chiaki-san — a cruel, unfair guy.
{% endbubble %}
{% img /img/es/eventstory/meteorimpact/secondhalfch9_2.jpg %}


{% bubble ChiakiPast %}
Even so. There’s no such thing as a clean person — everyone holds a dirty, awful part of them inside.

There is *no* reason for you to be told off as if you aren’t just another human being like everyone else.

{% endbubble %}
{% bubble MadaraPast hidden %}
… Hahaha, are you getting angry at them? For my sake?

I’ve been calling you an ordinary kid, but I’m gonna change that. You’re a strange kid.

And I love strange kids…

If you were just an ordinary kid, I was going to warn you once more to make sure you never get involved, and never wish for anything — even if it meant using force.

But since you’re a strange kid, there might be something special only you can do. I don’t know what it could be right now, but there might come a day when I’ll ask you for it.

{% endbubble %}

{% endbubble %}
{% bubble KanataPast %}
ahh… you were the one who signed the document to join, yes?

i could not make a club without at least Three members, so back then I was trying to find people to join.

kaoru had been lounging in this Room since last year…

so he told me Bluntly, “why don’t you just make this part of a club already?”

and then saying it would make it easier to Do as he likes with the club’s Budget.

i had thought that it was kaoru’s Wish… so i granted it.

but it seems i was wrong~ he told me it was simply a Joke.

so i asked him if he can Do as he likes now… and he only looked at me in annoyance. he is also a difficult one…

{% endbubble %}
{% bubble SoumaPast %}
Hm… You speak in a peculiar manner, so I am not quite sure what you are saying—

However, even if it was only a coincidence, I feel that it is fate for me to be in the same club as you.

you… ahh, your name is “Kanzaki”, yes?

is that *the* Kanzaki? the chieftain of this land—of this region?

{% endbubble %}
{% bubble SoumaPast %}
Indeed. My family has been appointed that role for several centuries now—since the Sengoku period… However, we do not have as much power as we used to in the bygone days.

Even so, we continued to pass on the contract that my ancestors had agreed upon. It had slipped my mind entirely as I hadn't known much back when this had occurred, but at one time in my youth I had been blessed with an opportunity for an audience with you.

{% endbubble %}
{% bubble KanataPast %}
Ahh~… yes, i think they come Greet me quite often. as well as people from Other households.

you do it in order to never forget the crime you committed long ago.

but, in those Ceremonies, i am always behind the Bamboo blinds…

so i could not tell it was you. it is only natural that neither of us Remember one another.

{% endbubble %}
{% bubble SoumaPast %}
Aha, I do not deserve such kind words. However, I will surely keep them in my heart for the rest of my life.

{% endbubble %}
{% bubble KanataPast %}
mrmm~… people act so friendly with me within School, so it is actually much more unnatural to hear someone speak the Usual way i am spoken to.

you do not need to speak to me so Formally, really. it is actually Harder to speak to you, as if i feel a Distance between us.

{% endbubble %}
{% bubble SoumaPast %}
Nay, I must keep a line between us. Even in Shintoism, it is said that us impure humans must only come in contact with God through the strands of the tamagushi—Even with the shrine maidens.

One must rip their ears to hear God, and crush their eyeballs to see.

{% endbubble %}
{% bubble KanataPast %}
ahh, i have heard of it. it sounds very painful…

but being kept at a distance in such a way… it truly makes me feel Lonely.

{% endbubble %}
{% bubble SoumaPast %}

{% endbubble %}
{% bubble KanataPast %}
no, nothing… anyway, what did you want to Speak to me about?

did you simply want to Greet me? or do you have a Wish in mind?

{% endbubble %}
{% bubble SoumaPast %}
Nay. I cannot speak for other people, but it would be absurd of us to pray to God. It is not permissible.

That is why, at the very least — I choose to aid God’s conduct, as part of the Kanzaki clan. Typically, our role is exactly as our family name stands: To conceal and shield God[^13] during a time of perplexity—

However, from what I have heard, you seem to be accomplishing your role without any waver.

Thus, we have no reason to perform our duty. However, I wish to repay you for the kindness you have bestowed upon us—The hand of salvation that you stretched out to us.

I am the son of samurais. I have been taught to repay others by being of service to them.

{% endbubble %}
{% bubble KanataPast %}

{% endbubble %}
{% bubble SoumaPast %}
O dear God; surely you must feel uncomfortable in this era, as faith is gradually being lost to the times.

There are those who wish to obstruct your duties and hurt you, for they have forgotten the contract from olden times.

You see, recently I have been visiting the Student Council office, and they seem puzzled by your conduct.

I say this on behalf of Hasumi-dono’s honor, but—in this era it is more common to find people who do not know the truth, thus it is only natural that he is confused.

{% endbubble %}
{% bubble KanataPast %}
hasumi… ahh, the Temple people. we have always had trouble compromising with those people.

after all, people from the Temple believe in Buddha, and not God.

{% endbubble %}
{% bubble SoumaPast %}
Indeed. I have heard all the old tales of the disputes that occurred when people misunderstood or were ignorant of the contract, and thus, in order to avoid that from happening once more… Unworthy as I may be, I swear to protect you.

I shall make sure that you are safe from Hasumi-dono and the Student Council.

I will make the proper arrangements to ensure that, so please continue with your conducts without worries.

I do feel remorseful for decieving Hasumi-dono and breaching his trust, as he is the one who allowed me to come speak to you…

However, he is also someone I deeply respect. I do not wish to see him clash with you for such needless reasons.

Of course, there may also be a time when I must choose between fighting for you, or fighting for Hasumi-dono…

Heeey! Akehoshi-ku—Akehoshi! Good work at the Venus Cup!

I watched you! You were sparkling everywhere! You really are our Basketball Club’s pride!

Heheh~♪ Actually, when the performance was over, I stood around waiting for you so I could reward you for your hard work, but…

You were hugging the other people you went onstage with out of joy, so—

I thought it’s better I don’t get in your way, and held back from calling out to you! How about that!? I’m a senpai who can be considerate, aren’t I!? Feel free to praise me! ☆

But man, how nice, Akehoshi! I’m so jealous! I want to be up on stage like that, too…♪

{% endbubble %}

{% endbubble %}
{% bubble ChiakiPast %}
Hm? Um, yep, that’s me!

Right, right! You’ve been calling me that since a while back now, haven’t you? I’m still not used to it, so I was a little late to respond!

{% endbubble %}
{% bubble Subaru %}
Shhh… Sorry, don’t make so much noise.

I kinda forgot I was still wearing the outfit for the Venus Cup, see…

Then like, I had a party with the guys I performed on stage with while still in this outfit…

Oh, but we only did it after we cheered Hidaka-kun on during the play after the Venus Cup.

But then, they pointed out that I’m still wearing this outfit, so I came back over to school for a sec—

I’m just borrowing this outfit, so I gotta make sure to return it, and like… They’ll make me pay if I tear or ruin it.

But, there was clamor all over the school—

And I guess you call them the producer of the Venus Cup…? But I couldn’t find the supervisor from the Student Council either…

I wasn’t sure what to do, so I peeked into the backstage…

That was when I saw this guy crouched down in a dark corner…

{% endbubble %}
{% bubble Subaru %}
Mhm… and then like, I called out to him, thinking he was feeling ill…

But he didn’t respond back, and when I asked him if I should call for someone, he started screaming really loudly.

I really dunno what to do…

I think he doesn’t want to be seen by anyone, so I tried to help him up while hiding him, and managed all the way up to this point—

But I mean, the whole school’s going about like nuts, right?

We’re stuck in crowds, so I think it’ll be hard to take him over to some place quiet without being seen… I’m really stuck with what to do now.

What do I do? What happened, anyway? He looks like the world is about to collapse…

{% endbubble %}
{% bubble ChiakiPast %}
I-I don’t know. After watching you onstage, I had to go to a part-time job, and left school for a bit.

But then I thought I should do some practice, so now I’m here again.

W-Well, no matter! Fear not, Akehoshi! I’ll bring over that laundry trolley for cleaning, and some sheets or maybe curtains!

We’ll hide Itsuki-kun like that and carry him off somewhere!

I-Is that good enough?

{% endbubble %}
{% bubble Subaru %}
I dunno… You should ask him, not me. I brought him all the way over here, but I don’t even know if that was the right thing to do or not.

……

……

{% endbubble %}
{% bubble KeitoPast %}
Right. Allow me to recap our current situation, as well as explain our plan from here on.

A few days ago, Valkyrie — The stagnant powerhouse regarded as the number one unit in the entire academy — was defeated by our fellow unit *fine*.

Valkyrie represented the old era — and was led by Itsuki Shu of the Five Eccentrics, no less. Having subjugated him is a significant feat.

*fine* won with astoundingly better results than Valkyrie — No one could object to that fact.

This was the majority’s opinion. Or at the very least, the DreamFes system is designed to make everyone think that it is.

According to the DreamFes votes, the entire student body — the *public* wanted this result.

We managed to deal with the aftermath perfectly, too. We prepared everything in secret for that aforementioned day.

The Five Eccentrics are the evil that must be exterminated — And we, the Student Council, and the public supporting us, are part of justice.

That is the tale we’ll be writing. The real truth doesn’t matter.
{% endbubble %}
{% img /img/es/eventstory/meteorimpact/secondhalfch13_1.jpg %}

{% bubble KeitoPast %}
“The Five Eccentrics are to blame for why us normal students suffer misfortune and unfulfilling lives.”

“Thus we, the student body, will join forces and eradicate the root of evil.”

“And with that, we will build a new era.” — That is the revolutionary tale of good and evil that we’ll make *everyone* believe, so that they have no more doubts.

I’ve laid out the entire plot. In fact, that is what I have been doing this whole time: preparing and refining everything specifically for this tale.

The result was decided before the war had even begun. The only thing left to do is to dance to the tale's tune until the end.

We have to hurry as much as we can. Eichi, as well as *fine*, are burning through their energy faster than I expected. It’s only natural, as they’ve been going around trampling and destroying people.

As long as they have conscience inside of them, they won’t be able to handle doing so much longer.

Eichi is more physically disadvantaged than others. Time won’t be kind to us… We have to decide our next move in a flash.

We’ll put an end to everything, while everyone is agitated and caught up in the heat of the battlefield — and before the public wakes up from their reverie.

The faster we finish the job, the better. Any second longer, and everyone will drop to an irreversible doom.

We’ll strike swiftly and precisely.
{% endbubble %}
{% img /img/es/eventstory/meteorimpact/secondhalfch13_2.jpg %}
{% bubble KeitoPast %}
However, I doubt we’ll have an easy time from hereon. We were able to lead Valkyrie into a trap, and defeat them with a surprise attack—

But there were only three people in that unit, and they were in their own closed world. That was why it was possible to annihilate them in one blow.

As for the rest of the Eccentrics… Sakasaki Natsume is far too inexperienced at the moment, but the other three have built a deep foundation of their own within the academy.

Each of them have their own devotees. It’s highly possible that we’ll gain animosity were we to “assassinate” them the same way we did to Valkyrie.

The dead would only become the heroes instead. It’s *us* who must become the heroes, and *they* who become the wretched demons that we must defeat.

I’ve kept this factor in mind for the next set of the plans… And so, the next Oddball to subjugate will be Shinkai Kanata.

I had considered Sakasaki Natsume at first, as he’s still far too inexperienced, and thus, much weaker to the rest…

As well as Hibiki Wataru, since he’s entirely infatuated with theater, and barely performs any idol activities—

But the order that they are subjugated is crucial. If we were to aim for Sakasaki first, the other Eccentrics would join forces to oppose, due to their favoring him.

At the moment, we would be at a disadvantage were they to do so. They still have far too many devotees.

In order to aim for Sakasaki, we have to first defeat more Eccentrics, and reduce their influence…

This way, even if they were to join forces, they wouldn’t be able to win against us. I prefer aiming for him only after that outcome has been decided.

As for Hibiki, his lack of proper idol activities is a worrisome factor.

This means we still have no idea what his true abilities are as an idol.

I don’t understand why Eichi thinks so highly of that eccentric, but…

In the case that Hibiki *does* have some hidden skill within him, then he may retaliate were we to recklessly attack.

If even the slightest possibility of that could happen, then our odds of winning are still low. We must tread carefully with this plan.

It’s not too late in the game to eradicate Hibiki *after* we learn everything there is to know about him, including his true identity.

We’ll leave him for later. This means that our next target to subjugate is Shinkai Kanata.

{% endbubble %}
{% bubble KuroPast smile %}
… And what about Sakuma? Did you just forget ‘bout him, Danna?

If you’re worried one of them could turn the odds in their favor, then he’s the exact guy who could, even if he was the last one left.

I know none of ‘em are easy opponents, but he’s definitely the first guy we need to get rid of, ‘cause he’s so freakin’ strong.

I know the DEADMANZ live feels like it happened long ago, but you can’t tell me you forgot all about it.

He turned everythin’ around at the very moment you thought you won, and you lost to him so badly that it almost made you cry— remember?

{% endbubble %}
{% bubble KeitoPast %}
It did *not*. However, I simply don’t see a single chance of winning against Sakuma Rei at the moment.

I can’t shake off the doubt in my heart — That all my planning and preparation would simply go to waste, just like how it did in my miserable defeat at the DEADMANZ live—

I feel as though I would end up dancing in the palm of his hand yet again, just like how I always have since our early childhood.

I do feel as though it has turned me into sort of a sore loser, though, which does frustrate me…

But that’s exactly why I left this job for Eichi. He’s currently using all his influence and power to fully block off Sakuma Rei.

He just finished with the battle against Valkyrie, and thus requires time to recuperate from the fatigue…

… That’s why, in the meantime, we Akatsuki will support the war front.

In fact, it *must* be us who eradicate Shinkai Kanata.

{% endbubble %}
{% bubble KuroPast smile %}
… What d’you mean?

{% endbubble %}
{% bubble KeitoPast %}
You don’t know? Shinkai Kanata of the Five Eccentrics, as well as the Yaobikuni group of his, are a religious force.

They are bound together by a faith that we cannot grasp, nor have any sight of.

Religious faith is founded on emotional support. Subjugating Shinkai Kanata means we are attempting to rob *that* from them.

The worshippers in Yaobikuni are all the frail students who could do nothing but depend on God…

Which means that they make up the public. We can’t let *fine *be the ones who drench themselves with the blood of the people in the public. After all, they’re meant to be the protagonists of this tale—the heroes.

They’re heroes through defeating the monsters, but were they to massacre the people, then they would only become vicious madmen.

Therefore, it must be us to do it. Akatsuki is in charge of the dirty work.

{% bubble KeitoPast %}
Religious faith has no shape or form — That’s exactly why we can’t use realistic measures to compensate for it with something like money.

Eichi is the son of the Tenshouin Zaibatsu[^15], and so, he’s extremely capable with such pragmatic situations—

However, we’re dealing with a formless, ghostly concept here— There aren’t many feasible ways to approach this matter. The one who’s suitable to face things like this is me, since I’m the son of a temple.

I’ve already finished the preparations. Shinkai Kanata is on thin ice, alongside the Yaobikuni—the cult holding onto a questionable faith.

Just watch. No—Follow after me without a word, and I’ll tell you all about my strategy for this religious war.

H-Hold on a moment, Hasumi-dono!

{% endbubble %}
{% bubble KeitoPast %}
… What is it, Kanzaki. You were listening to me without uttering a word, so I assumed it meant you had nothing to say on the matter.

Is there something you wanted to bring up? Or actually, let me be blunt: is there a *problem* with what I'm saying?

{% endbubble %}
{% bubble SoumaPast %}
A problem…? No, I would never have any objections to your words, Hasumi-dono.

You have bestowed upon me a place of belonging, and led me to a pathway. I am greatly indebted to you; that is why I pledged an oath to obey your word.

If it is what you wish, then I shall repay you. If you order me to do so, then I have no choice but to become your blade.

I will do anything for you. I would not even object to tainting my hands with blood.

That is what it means to show loyalty—to be of service to someone. That is the discipline I have been raised with. Once you have ascertained your lord, then you mustn’t oppose them—

{% endbubble %}
{% bubble KeitoPast %}
Oh? Well, this is a surprise. You really are quite the actor, Kanzaki.

{% endbubble %}
{% bubble SoumaPast %}
…? *<th>(surprised look)</th>*

{% endbubble %}
{% bubble KeitoPast %}
You almost had me fooled. How brilliant — Allow me to compliment your skills.

To think all that anachronistic talk you speak was nothing but empty words — a means to achieve your true goal.

I had simply chalked you off as proof that the world has all kinds of people — including people living like the samurai of the olden days.

But it was never like that, was it? The thought that there could be someone who’s *loyal* to you in this day and age… It’s absolutely absurd.

You really are just another foolish liar.

You were simply a fraud — The bushido way of life and the Japanese spirit are nothing more than a lost sense of value, only found in ancient scripts.

But I won’t blame you. You see, it’s only natural for it to be this way — After all, there isn’t *any* place for a samurai to be in this generation.

You did the best you could to pretend to be a samurai who holds himself proudly, and let yourself indulge in the selfish desire to feel honorable.

It’s just like measles — You simply have one of those illnesses[^16] one suffers through during puberty. There’s no point blaming the ill, *I’m* the fool here for believing that you were a real samurai.

{% endbubble %}
{% bubble SoumaPast %}
N-No…! I was never trying to decieve you! I have always felt this way from the bottom of my—

{% endbubble %}
{% bubble KeitoPast %}
Shut up, you traitor!

{% endbubble %}
{% bubble SoumaPast %}
—!?

{% endbubble %}
{% bubble KeitoPast %}
… Did you really think I didn’t know a single thing?

Did you really think I was *that* stupid? You must think so lightly of me, it honestly makes me sad… Hmm, Kanzaki?

Did you think my glasses were just for show? That I can’t actually see anything through them?

You fabricated your report on the Yaobikuni, didn’t you?
{% endbubble %}
{% img /img/es/eventstory/meteorimpact/secondhalfch14_1.jpg %}

{% bubble SoumaPast %}
……

{% endbubble %}
{% bubble KeitoPast %}
You asked me to leave it to you, so I complied. And yet, this is how you repay me, Kanzaki.

Your report was well-written, but nobody could ever fool me *or* the King of Hell.[^17]

He’ll pull your tongue out for being a liar.

You wrote your report cleverly, tried to make me believe that the Yaobikuni and Shinkai Kanata were harmless, and would pose no threat to us.

But you see, I enjoy reading, which means I’m extremely good at reading between the lines. I read through your intentions, and found the inconsistencies in your report by comparing it to reality — to the tale that was happening around me.

Then I compiled my speculations, and asked my parents to teach me what there is to know — and thus, learnt of the tradition that revolves around this land. I landed on only one conclusion—

Kanzaki. You denied it, but you were just another one of those worshippers infected by the religion of this land.

That’s why you attempted to protect the Living God Shinkai Kanata, so that no harm reaches him.

{% endbubble %}
{% bubble SoumaPast %}
…….

{% endbubble %}
{% bubble KeitoPast %}
I won’t think of this as you biting at the hand that feeds you. Obviously you, a worshipper, would try to protect your God.

To you, that is simply the most natural thing to do—it’s common sense to you. You probably didn’t even consider that it would be a crime to deceive me in this way.

That’s what religion is — what faith means.

You can’t beat it with logic, no matter how hard you try — No common sense, no justification could win against the foundation that simply says “That is how God wills it.”

That’s why I’ve given up on the thought of lecturing you with sincerity, or even exposing your deceivery.

I have no expectations from you any longer… There's no way to compromise if we believe in different Gods.

Instead, I thought I would let you do as you please, so I could then use you to my advantage.

But you didn’t notice that, because you let your guard down after thinking you had me fooled.

{% endbubble %}
{% bubble SoumaPast %}
…? *<th>(surprised look)</th>*

{% endbubble %}
{% bubble KeitoPast %}
I’ve already come in contact with Shinkai Kanata in secret. It was one of the first steps I took.

And, like a machine made to perform only one function, he asked me for my wish—

So I answered him with this: “Tell your worshippers that the reason you’re capable of granting wishes is all due to the Student Council.”

Shinkai immediately agreed to grant it. That’s the kind of living thing he is — he will grant *any* wish.

He won't think twice before granting it — you ask, and he grants.

Don’t you see? Ever since then, every miracle Shinkai has been granting comes back to being because of us, the Student Council.

*We’re* the ones saving those lost, troubled students, not him.

And as you know, Shinkai grants even the most unbelievable wishes.

Miracles that we could never make a reality on our own, not when we were so weak — Surely there must be people who thought that way.

This is where you came in handy.
{% endbubble %}
{% img /img/es/eventstory/meteorimpact/secondhalfch14_2.jpg %}

{% bubble SoumaPast %}
……

{% endbubble %}
{% bubble KeitoPast %}
Kanzaki. You acted as a person of virtue, aiding Shinkai in his daily duties perfectly.

Many people caught sight of you going there and back from visiting him.

And you’re a member of Akatsuki, the Student Council force. We heavily emphasized this about us in every live show we’ve performed.

… Were you happy you were appointed an important role by us?
{% endbubble %}
{% img /img/es/eventstory/meteorimpact/secondhalfch14_3.jpg %}


{% bubble SoumaPast %}
……

{% endbubble %}
{% bubble KeitoPast %}
But the truth is far different. As *if* I’d appoint a traitor with anything. You’re nothing but a disposable pawn to me.

Thus, we displayed to the public that you were not only a member of the Student Council force, but also connected to the Living God Shinkai.

And that helped increase credibility to the “fact” that *we *are the ones to thank for all the wishes being granted.

People would start to connect the dots: you, a member of the Student Council force, is helping out the Living God—

I can only hope this would eventually make them believe that Shinkai Kanata is nothing but a convenient tool to us.

Though in reality, there obviously hasn't been any dealings between us and Shinkai.

But you see, he maintains his faith through being mysterious.[^18] There’s never a *logical* explanation provided to how he grants wishes.

That’s why his worshippers will try to find their *own* explanation. As soon as a single doubt appears in their mind, more will follow after, and then it will be our victory.

Soon, they’ll think to themselves, perhaps the one saving them wasn’t Shinkai Kanata, but the Student Council all along.

{% bubble KeitoPast %}
Hey, Kanzaki. You went quiet — Are you alright? Can’t you at least respond? Or is it difficult for a samurai like yourself to speak in our modern language?

{% endbubble %}
{% bubble SoumaPast %}
……

{% endbubble %}
{% bubble KeitoPast %}
Tell me, what year are we in? We’re in the twenty-first century already. Surely you can think scientifically on your own if you’ve taken the mandatory education.

No one would ever believe that God and ghosts exist. At least, society wouldn’t.

If you ever seriously spoke of the supernatural, people would laugh it off as a joke.

That’s what we’ll be doing — Make everyone laugh off Shinkai Kanata of the Five Eccentrics, the scoundrel claiming to be God.

There’s no chance God could ever exist.

We’ll make them believe that the wishes are being granted not through paranormal miracles, but through *us*, the Student Council — and that we used *normal*, realistic methods.

We’ll make them lose faith in Shinkai Kanata. No — we’ll steal that faith for ourselves.

Instead of that made-up “God”, we’ll be the ones to coddle those dependent worshippers from now on.

They’ll yield to us without hesitation. After all, anyone who’s seen a wish being miraculously granted will continue yearning for more.

That’s why such effortless gratification will never disappear from our world.

Having known the delight of such comforts, the faint of heart tend to drown in dependence on them.

That’s what we’ll become to them.

Once we do, Shinkai Kanata—the obsolete God will only be a hindrance. We’ll subdue him and have him disappear. The students only need *us* to believe in and depend on.

We’ll become their new God instead.

{% endbubble %}
{% bubble SoumaPast %}
N-no… To become a God in His stead — It is unforgivable!

You do not understand a thing, Hasumi-dono! A catastrophe will befall us — Shinkai-dono is not worshipped as God simply as a joke!

There is a reason why we have kept the faith going for so long — why we need God to exist!

This is territory humans mustn't interfere with!

{% endbubble %}
{% bubble KeitoPast %}
I expected you to react that way, you primitive fool… I *just* said that I researched all about the traditions of this land, did I not? I know about everything.

Let me ask you this instead: You’re a highschooler by now; do you *really* still believe in that fairytale?

Did you ask your mommy and daddy to read it to you on nights you couldn’t sleep when you were young?

{% endbubble %}
{% bubble SoumaPast %}
… Say what you will! But I will do whatever I must to stop you from doing *that*!

God is necessary in this world! It is a role of holiness, one that could never be appointed to a mere human!

It is impossible for someone to become a God in His stead, is it not!?

It is precisely *because* Shinkai-dono is our God that wishes were granted! For He has worshippers who serve Him! And you dare insinuate that the Student Council is capable of such feats?

{% endbubble %}
{% bubble KeitoPast %}
Well, we’ll only make it *look* like we can. Although, I doubt we’ll be carrying that facade for very long… We only need to make the public daydream until we’ve accomplished our revolution.

They’re meek beings clinging onto God, they won’t be of use to us any other way.

The same goes for you. There’s nothing you could do for me, not when you’re just a hollow, lying fraud that can’t think with his own head.

I only need to throw you away now that I’ve made use of you as much as I could.

{% endbubble %}
{% bubble SoumaPast %}
I… Hasumi-dono, for you, I wou—

{% endbubble %}
{% bubble KeitoPast %}
What do you think you’re doing? I’ve no interest in keeping useless ornaments in my room.

I have work to discuss here. Children who believe in fairytales should leave the room at once.

From today forth, you’re banished from Akatsuki. You fabricated a false report filled with lies and fraudulence, and betrayed my hopes for you… So it’s only natural to dispose of you, isn’t it?

Kanzaki, don’t you *dare* show your face to me ever again. I’m through with you.

{% endbubble %}
{% bubble SoumaPast %}

Haha, poor him. He was basically in tears.

{% endbubble %}
{% bubble KeitoPast %}
… I had to. Boys only grow stronger with every tear they shed.

{% endbubble %}
{% bubble KuroPast smile %}
Oh? Are you gonna say you’re tryin’ to hone him?

{% endbubble %}
{% bubble KeitoPast %}
Of course not. This is just my own selfish ego — You could say it’s the same as a parent who insists abuse is a means of discipline.

{% endbubble %}
{% bubble KuroPast smile %}
Haha, woah. You’re pretty dark, aintcha, daddy-o.[^19]

{% endbubble %}
{% bubble KeitoPast %}
Stick to one name already. No, nevermind, there won’t be any need to… I don’t mind if this was the last straw for you — You’re free to never show yourself here ever again.

I laughed it off a second ago, but the truth is — the tradition within this land is terrifyingly rooted deep beyond measure.

I honestly can’t predict how the worshippers would react were we to interfere with their faith regarding Shinkai Kanata.

{% endbubble %}
{% bubble KuroPast smile %}
Is that why you drove out Kanzaki? ‘Cause he’ll be safe from whatever could happen if you make him have no relation to us?

{% endbubble %}
{% bubble KeitoPast %}
That, too. But in reality, his hands are still clean.

From here onwards… No, from the very moment we began our revolution by defeating Valkyrie, we have entered a reign in which nothing can be settled with kind behavior.

He’s someone who’s earnestly and genuinely trying to become an idol—

I could never bear to have him as an accomplice, when he hasn’t even hurt anyone, nor bears any sin in hand.

Only *I* need to be corrupted. So, Kiryu, you too can—

{% endbubble %}
{% bubble KuroPast smile %}
Oh, shut up. I’ve been dyed black throughout my whole body since long back, aight? There ain’t no chance for me to get rid of it. I’ve hurt too many folks at the Dragon King Competition, and other places too, y’know.

There’s no turnin’ back for me.

{% endbubble %}
{% bubble KeitoPast %}
… I see. That will be a huge help, I won’t deny. I tried to act tough earlier, but I’m aware that I can barely do anything on my own.

I’m still on my way there… No, everything has only just begun.

I need your help in order to make these dreams come true. I’m weak… I couldn’t even push such a pure, adoring child away without hurting him.

{% endbubble %}
{% bubble KuroPast smile %}
Yeah, yeah, keep your grumblin’ for later. We’re only gonna get busier, Danna.

Let’s start doin’ what we need to do, as quickly as possible. Besides, I already know exactly where I’m headin’ — After all, I’ve left my childhood friend to die, despite my promise to protect him.

I’ve committed sins, so we’re both goin’ straight to hell. Which means it’s just idiotic to waste our time fumblin’ about.

Let’s live and die like fireworks, and get boiled up in the kettle of Hell together.

We’ll rinse our bodies with hot water then — So let’s get to drenchin’ ourselves in blood.

<th>(There were already a few people who were jealous and frustrated with the Five Eccentrics, since they seemed to be given special privilege for no reason…)</th>

<th>(But they’re at the top of Yumenosaki Academy. Everyone was grovelling at their feet in public, without any complaints.)</th>

<th>(Yet… Ever since Valkyrie suffered that cruel defeat that day—)</th>

<th>(Everyone began to curse at them, as if they were letting loose built-up resentment.)</th>

<th>(Telling them to “get off their high horse”, calling them “eccentrics just posing as geniuses”, saying that they’re “cheaters who bypassed the system”…)</th>

<th>(They began to support the Student Council, who disdained the Five Eccentrics and waged a war against them.)</th>

<th>(It’s almost hard to believe… It’s as if a magic spell was cast on them… They all flipped a switch somehow — They’re letting themselves go along with what their council superiors say.)</th>

<th>(The school’s social media suddenly became used commonly among the students, apparently because it’s practically free and easy to use—)</th>

<th>(And there are a vast amount of accounts who keep linking and spreading the Student Council’s posts, following suit with their exact words.)</th>

<th>(They’re doing nothing but repeating after the Student Council, but the more they make their own comments about it, the more they strongly feel the same way as the Student Council.)</th>

<th>(They brainwash themselves, and make themselves believe that the Student Council’s opinions are their own.)</th>

<th>(They can relax knowing they’re part of the bigger force. Now that they're at a safe place, they make themselves feel better and more important by trampling over what is now the minority—The Five Eccentrics.)</th>

<th>(Yet, despite all this, the bullying never stops. Why? Because they don’t think they’re doing anything wrong.)</th>

<th>(They’re doing this under the impression that they’re cheering for the heroes, and together they beat down the bad guys and monsters[^20] that must be loathed.)</th>

<th>(They think it’s fine to crush them — that, by hurling them off into the hemisphere and letting them explode into nothingness, they’re making the world one bit cleaner…)</th>

<th>(They don’t feel guilty about it at all! They just believe themselves to be in the right without a single doubt!)</th>

<th>(What did you want to say, Shinkai-kun? “Save me”? Or maybe, “don’t get involved with me”? Just like Mikejima-san kept telling me?)</th>

<th>(Or maybe it was the usual thing? Were you trying to ask me what my wish was?)</th>

<th>(Even though you can’t even grant wishes! You’re not some God, you’re just a human being!)</th>

<th>(… Lately, I’ve been hearing a rumor — that he can no longer grant any wishes.)</th>

<th>(Apparently, there’s still the Yaobikuni people who tell their wishes to him, but they’re never granted. It’s all over the school social media.)</th>

<th>(That he’s a liar, that he’s a fraud…)</th>

<th>(I think security’s been increased, too, so his worshippers can’t get in school anymore.)</th>

<th>(The scheme that exists to grant those wishes can’t function anymore.)</th>

<th>(The Student Council has been guarding the school grounds, and cracking down on any suspicious people.)</th>

<th>(Actually, no—If the Student Council force is working towards overthrowing the Five Eccentrics…)</th>

<th>(Then they’re probably obstructing Shinkai-kun from granting a wish.)</th>

<th>(Nothing about this was done by magic.)</th>

<th>(That kid isn’t a God. If you ever wanted to, you could do what it takes to stop those “miracles” from happening.)</th>

<th>(It makes me question if they’re really going to go as far as doing that… If they are, then it’s absolutely terrible.)</th>

<th>(That kid — Shinkai-kun has been maintaining his divinity by granting wishes.)</th>

<th>(He never once failed to do so. If he’s truly a God, then he should be almighty… that he would never make a single mistake.)</th>

<th>(And yet, he wasn’t able to grant any wish, over and over.)</th>

<th>(I think whoever is managing the Student Council’s social media account has been exaggerating those failures, and making sure it spreads across the platform.)</th>

{% bubble ChiakiPast %}
A-Ahh… I did say that, huh… I’m happy to see you join the club more often lately, Akehoshi.

{% endbubble %}
{% bubble Subaru %}
I just had the free time, is all. But y’know~ The Venus Cup that happened the other day ended up going really well—

Like, originally, the live show wasn’t going to have any advertisement in any way, but people still heard about it through rumors and sent over job offers to me.

I was so happy about it that I basically accepted every single one of them, so I’m gonna start getting busy soon.

So, yeah… That’s why I wanna practice. Could I do it here with you?

{% endbubble %}
{% bubble ChiakiPast %}
Mhm… Of course, you’re always welcome.

{% endbubble %}
{% bubble Subaru %}
Thanks! You saved me a bunch~ The practice rooms aren’t for free, after all.

I’m not gonna get my pay until after I’m done with all the jobs, and I’m already broke just preparing what’s necessary for them~

It’s putting me in a tough spot right now, so I’m glad you were in here. I figured there wouldn’t be any other Ryuseitai members with you, since they’re never motivated.

So I was like, oh, maybe Bucho~ could let me use a corner of his practice room for my own needs.

And I was right~ It’s so spacious here when you’re all alone, huh? I’ll make sure not to get in your way, though—

But yep, I’ll take your offer and practice in this room.

{% endbubble %}
{% bubble ChiakiPast %}
Mhm, feel free! Oh, but don’t go for the corner! Let’s practice together!

If there’s anything you don’t know, just ask me! I’ll teach you from top to bottom! ♪

{% bubble Subaru %}
Whaa~? I may need help with basketball, but I doubt there’s anything you could teach me when it comes to idol stuff, ‘kay?

What!? Don’t look down on me, Akehoshi! I study very hard, so both my practical grades and theoretical grades are excellent!

{% endbubble %}

Ahaha, no matter how good your grades are, it doesn’t have much to do with idol activities, does it?

{% endbubble %}
{% bubble ChiakiPast %}
True, but… I suppose as the elder here, it shows how I have wisdom learned over time—

Hm? I just noticed this, but aren’t you a little wet? The weather should’ve been good today; did a rainshower happen at some point?

{% endbubble %}
{% bubble Subaru %}
Ahh… It’s not from the rain. A weird guy got hold of me, see…

{% endbubble %}
{% bubble ChiakiPast %}
D-Did he throw water at you or something!? That’s so cruel! I’ll go make a complaint!

{% endbubble %}

Oh, no no! I think he was bathing in the fountain for some reason.

{% endbubble %}
{% bubble ChiakiPast %}

{% endbubble %}

I was doing my usual walk with Daikichi, yeah? Then suddenly, the guy just jumped on me, so I got splashed with water.

I guess I’m this soaked ‘cause he clinged to me.

I tried to wipe it off with a towel, but maybe it didn’t dry off enough…? Sorry, sorry. I’ll wipe the wet floor with a mop or something, okay?

That weird person… was Shinkai Kanata-kun, wasn’t it?

{% endbubble %}
{% bubble Subaru %}
Y-Yeah. Yep, the guy from the Five Eccentrics.

That guy’s had it hard lately, hasn’t he…? The Five Oddball people have been getting harsh criticism, so he looked pretty mentally exhausted to me.

He was mumbling something while clinging to me; stuff like, “tell me your wish” and “let me grant your wish”… Honestly, it kinda freaked me out.

{% endbubble %}
{% bubble ChiakiPast %}
……

{% endbubble %}
{% bubble Subaru %}
Ah, that’s right! Maybe I misheard, but he mentioned your name at one point, too.

He kept saying “Chiaki”… I don’t think there’s anyone else with that name in this school, right?

{% endbubble %}
{% bubble ChiakiPast %}
Huh? He called my name? Why would he…?

{% endbubble %}
{% bubble Subaru %}
I dunno. I think Daikichi thought I was getting attacked when he hugged me…

He started barking, so I hurried to pull him and took him back home.

So I dunno why he called for you.

Is he your friend or something?

{% endbubble %}
{% bubble ChiakiPast %}
Wha…?

{% endbubble %}
{% bubble Subaru %}
You’re a hero, after all. You can’t overlook a person in trouble, right? That’s what you always say.

You’re a hero of justice who crushes the strong and saves the weak, right?

That guy also knows that about you, doesn’t he? That’s why he kept calling your name — he probably wants your help, yeah?

Whatcha gonna do? How are you gonna save him?

It’s probably gonna be super hard to pull off, but… I’m cheering you on! Actually, if there’s anything I can do, tell me! I’ll do the best I can to help!

Hehe. I’m so grateful to have you, Bucho~. I had so many awful days, but I was still able to keep on being an idol.

Whenever it felt too rough or when I was feeling lonely, you’d always call out to me. You saved me a whole bunch just by doing that.

You kept saying stuff like, “I don’t want you to go,” “I want you to stay with me”…

I can stay as an idol as long as someone—even if it’s only one person—wants me to be one. I’ll be able to laugh, sing, and dance.

I dunno why you’re always so nice to me… No, actually, that’s exactly why it made me so happy.

Knowing there was someone who’d be nice to me without any specific reason… I may be exaggerating, but it honestly allowed me to avoid despairing about the world.

So thank you.

I’m so, so grateful, I looove you, Bucho~…♪

{% endbubble %}
{% bubble ChiakiPast %}
……

{% endbubble %}
{% bubble Subaru %}
A-Ah, yep! Serious talk over! Sorry! I said something weird!

Being in school has been making me feel awful, and it reminded me of the past… so like, it kinda made me a little anxious and unstable, I think!

{% endbubble %}
{% bubble ChiakiPast %}
Akehoshi.

{% endbubble %}
{% bubble Subaru %}
Hm? What is it…? I’m starting to feel really embarrassed, so just forget what I said!

{% endbubble %}
{% bubble ChiakiPast %}
… Alright. I’ll forget about it.

{% endbubble %}
{% bubble Subaru %}
…?

{% endbubble %}
{% bubble ChiakiPast %}
What you said to me makes me so happy… I don’t actually want to forget it.

That was the most grateful and most honorable thing I've ever been told in my entire life.

But, I’ll forget about it. So you should forget about it too, please.

{% endbubble %}
{% bubble Subaru %}
U…h? Forget about what?

{% endbubble %}
{% bubble ChiakiPast %}
All those things I said—where I was only pretending to be a hero, talking like some know-it-all.

{% endbubble %}
{% bubble Subaru %}
……

{% endbubble %}
{% bubble ChiakiPast %}
I was never a hero. I loved them, I longed to become them— But no matter how hard I try, I will never be able to become one—

I finally realized that. I finally recognized that.
{% endbubble %}
{% img /img/es/eventstory/meteorimpact/secondhalfch18_1.jpg %}


{% bubble Subaru %}
What’re you saying, Bucho~…?

{% endbubble %}
{% bubble ChiakiPast %}
Thinking back on everything — it was all just some stupid, childish dream. I never understood a single thing.

Our world is not like a tokusatsu show. Every guy in the whole, entire world realizes that early on, but I never did until this very moment.

No… I *should* have realized, but I refused to accept it.

But… I can’t do it anymore.
{% endbubble %}
{% img /img/es/eventstory/meteorimpact/secondhalfch18_2.jpg %}


{% bubble Subaru %}
……

{% endbubble %}
{% bubble ChiakiPast %}
I mean, look at me! I can’t do *anything*! You asked me what I’ll do for him, didn’t you? There’s not a single thing I would ever be able to do, Akehoshi!

I don’t even have a clue where to start! I bet it would just go to waste even if I did try!

Look at this! This is the toy figurine of the very first hero I admired!

I'd carry him with me all the time, just like a charm! Knowing a hero was here, right by my side, gave me peace of mind!

But! He does absolutely nothing for me! I shouted so many times for help! Deep down, *and* out loud!

But the hero never, ever came to save me!

{% endbubble %}
{% bubble Subaru %}
……

{% endbubble %}
{% bubble ChiakiPast %}
It hurt so much to be ignored and made fun of by the guys who were supposed to be my comrades! One time, they saw my toy figure and tore it apart, mocking me the whole time!

It made me feel horrible! But I held it in and laughed it off!

There’s so many of them—I may be doing muscle training now, but I’ve always, *always* been weak! I will *never* win against them!

I never had the guts to fight them, either! After all, violence is never the answer! I just thought that if I held on long enough that eventually, the hero would rescue me—

Not that it’s even possible…! And yet, I still believed in it the whole time—No, I *forced* myself to believe in it, just to make myself feel better!

I kept believing that life is only hard right then! That one day, as long as I keep my heart in the right place, I’ll be rewarded for it!

I lived my life that way, just telling myself that, over and over! But I'm over that… I’ve finally realized that’s never going to happen, just like everyone else!

There’s no point in doing anything! I feel bad for Shinkai-kun, I really do! If I could help him, I would! But there’s nothing I can ever do for him!

I’m so sorry! You had hope in me, you believed that I was a hero! But that’s exactly why I just can’t keep lying about this anymore!

You can see it yourself, can’t you!? This is who I am! I can’t protect anyone, and I can’t save anyone! I’m not a hero!

I don’t deserve your respect…!

… Oh…

Ah, okay. I got it, it’s fine… Sorry for hoping for something from you.

{% endbubble %}
{% bubble ChiakiPast %}
……

{% endbubble %}
{% bubble Subaru %}
Ahh, jeez… That ruined my mood.

Sorry, I’ll just go home for today. I just remembered I didn’t feed Daikichi, so I’m sure he’s whining for me.
{% endbubble %}
{% img /img/es/eventstory/meteorimpact/secondhalfch18_4.jpg %}


{% bubble Subaru %}
I did something bad, I guess… But oh well, no matter what kinda bad thing I do, a hero won’t come and punish me for it, right?

I know that already. Of *course* I was aware of that.

But it’s not like I wanted to be reminded about that fact.

{% endbubble %}
{% bubble ChiakiPast %}
……

{% endbubble %}
{% bubble Subaru %}
*Sigh*… In the end, you’re no different from everyone else, huh…

You’re all talk but nothing else… Saying that you’re doing it for love, for dreams, for justice… But once the time comes, you just look the other way instead of seeing all the foul, terrifying stuff out there in the world.

If some higher-up—If everyone starts saying, “*they’re* the bad guy,” you’ll just believe it’s true.

Not objecting to it, not sticking up for them, not saving them… just means you’re the same as *those* guys, doesn’t it?

You’re the same kind of person as the people who killed my dad.

{% endbubble %}
{% bubble ChiakiPast %}
I-I’m sor— It’s not like th— No. It's as you say.

I’m so sorry, Akehoshi.

{% endbubble %}
{% bubble Subaru %}
Nah, you don’t have to apologize.

But I'm super annoyed, so let me just say this.

… You’re being really uncool right now.

There’s things worth living for! Actually—I’ll even work hard so that you can believe that!

So please live, Shinkai-kun! That’s the only wish I’ll ever give you…!
{% endbubble %}
{% img /img/es/eventstory/meteorimpact/kanataorigcg.jpg %}


{% bubble KanataPast %}
wish—

… yes. hehe, you finally told me your Wish.

i’ve been waiting for so long, chiaki…♪

Ahh! You came back to life! I’m so glaaad…! Uaaah, I’m so, *so* glad you’re safe…! ☆ *<th>(sobs)</th>*

{% endbubble %}

hehe. what’s wrong, are you crying? or are you Imitating a Sea turtle, chiaki…?

did something Sad happen? should I give you a “good boy, good boy”? would that make you stop Crying?
{% endbubble %}
{% img /img/es/eventstory/meteorimpact/secondhalfch20_1.jpg %}


{% bubble ChiakiPast %}
Uuu~? N-No, you’re mistaken! I’m not crying! That’s just water in my eyes!

Actually— A hero only sheds happy tears, so that’s the kind of tears I’ve been shedding, okay…!?

{% endbubble %}
{% bubble KanataPast %}
i see! i understand now! so a hero does not cry, yes…?

hehe, i am jealous. you were able to become a hero…♪

{% endbubble %}
{% bubble ChiakiPast %}
Ah, no! That was just a figure of speech, I have a habit of thinking out loud, see…!?

Ahh, what am I saying! Point is, I don't have the qualifications to call myself a hero!

{% endbubble %}
{% bubble KanataPast %}
is that so? those “qualifications” are a necessity, i see~ is it some kind of Job?

{% endbubble %}
{% bubble ChiakiPast %}
No, it’s not a job, it’s a way of lif—… Ahhh, seriously, what am I on about?

{% endbubble %}
{% bubble KanataPast %}
hehe… please calm down, it will be okay.

thanks to you… i am saved.

but… you really are Mean, chiaki… who was it that granted your Wish?

you became a hero at some point, didn’t you?

even though i have become less of a God at some point…

{% endbubble %}
{% bubble ChiakiPast %}
……

{% endbubble %}
{% bubble KanataPast %}
i *am* a god, right? i am supposed to be, but everyone tells me it’s not true. why is that?

it seems like i have become a liar and a fraud.

that is what everyone says. is that true?

please tell me, chiaki, like when we first met—

if i am not a god, then what am i…?

i don’t understand… it is Sad not to understand. no matter who i Ask, no one gives me an Answer. but, if it is you, chiaki…

you, who i granted no Wish for, and Gave nothing… you, who always Gave me things.

you would teach me, wouldn’t you? that is what i had thought, so i had been searching for you forever.

{% endbubble %}
{% bubble ChiakiPast %}
……

{% endbubble %}
{% bubble KanataPast %}
but. i could not meet with you, and it was very— what was it… i think i felt “lonely”.

i do not understand what Lonely means yet…

that is why i wanted to Ask you about that, as well. what is “lonely”? what do i do to make it disappear? won’t you tell me?

or could it be that, now that i am no longer a god, you will not Give me anything?

do i no longer have any Right to receive a Tribute from you?

that… is really Lonely.

{% endbubble %}
{% bubble ChiakiPast %}
—!

{% endbubble %}
{% bubble KanataPast %}
wah! w-why are you Hugging me? you will get wet~ you Don’t like that, right?

to you people, that is an Unpleasant feeling, right?

me too. i am not Good at these things… you do not have Body contact like this within the Ocean.

my Scales will fully peel off. that is why… um, chiaki? are you listening?

{% endbubble %}
{% bubble ChiakiPast %}
… Yeah. I’m sorry for suddenly hugging you.
{% endbubble %}
{% img /img/es/eventstory/meteorimpact/secondhalfch20_2.jpg %}


{% bubble KanataPast %}
no… i feel Warm now. it feels like the “lonely” is slowly Disappearing.

i am not Good with hot things, but this does not feel Bad.

it Hurts a little, and i am not used to it… and it does feel a little strange. i-it is almost frightening.

it’s so hot, i feel like i could melt…

um. it is really distressing. you are putting Too much pressure — it is Painful.

the Land really is painful to Live on, isn’t it…?

such feelings don’t exist within the Ocean…

{% endbubble %}
{% bubble ChiakiPast %}
No… The ocean would be much more agonizing. Humans can’t breathe underwater.

{% endbubble %}
{% bubble KanataPast %}
yes, so it seems. i didn’t know that, because my household is within the Ocean, and i had not once thought of it as Agonizing.

perhaps they added Air inside the Rooms…

that must be it… i was within the Water, yet never got Wet.

oh gosh, couldn’t someone have at least told me that?

i had thought i was a Fishie, and that it was why i could breathe Underwater, too.

but, it seems difficult. i seem to be a fishie who can’t swim.

{% endbubble %}
{% bubble ChiakiPast %}
You’re not a fish, y’know… and you’re not a God, either.

{% endbubble %}
{% bubble KanataPast %}
… i *am* a god, though.

after all, if there is no god, everyone will be in distress… i have to be a god, or else.

{% endbubble %}
{% bubble ChiakiPast %}
W-What do you mean? I mean, it’s true that the worshippers who serve you as their Living God would be in trouble without you, but otherwise…?

{% endbubble %}
{% bubble KanataPast %}
no. without a god, the whole World will be in Distress.

{% endbubble %}
{% bubble ChiakiPast %}
…?

{% endbubble %}
{% bubble KanataPast %}
looong ago… a Meteorite fell down on this Land.

{% endbubble %}
{% bubble ChiakiPast %}
Meteorite…? What’re you going on about suddenly, Shinkai-kun!?

{% endbubble %}
{% bubble KanataPast %}
the story about God, chiaki. i had Overheard it during Ceremonies, so i don’t know the Full story, but…

looong ago, a Meteorite crashed down. in that meteorite there were many evil, sinful things—

that was how many Human beings became ill… and died.

{% endbubble %}
{% bubble ChiakiPast %}
<th>(Hrmmm? So what he means is that there was a legend like that? That people died from illnesses through evil things coming out of a meteorite?)</th>

<th>(It must’ve been a disease of some sort… and then, it began to spread across the land…?)</th>

{% endbubble %}
{% bubble KanataPast %}
it is also said that it was a Curse from the Beings slumbering underground.

the Land broke into pieces because of the Meteorite, and so flowed out the Curses from underground.

the evil, or perhaps the curses, mixed with the Water… and spread across this Land.

a higher up of Long past found that Terrifying—

so he Sacrificed those who did not fall ill, despite being on this Land… and tried to Fix everything that was happening.

{% endbubble %}
{% bubble ChiakiPast %}
Sacrifice… That must be about human sacrifice, huh… Legends like that are all over this world.

{% endbubble %}
{% bubble KanataPast %}
hm~ i think it is a little different from Human sacrifice. that would be sacrificing the Victims to the Ocean, right?

they *had* tried that at one point, but it did not seem to Work, and it had actually made the Curse even worse…

so everyone tried a different Method.

{% endbubble %}
{% bubble ChiakiPast %}
Different… method…?

{% endbubble %}
{% bubble KanataPast %}
yes. first, they tore the Sacrifice to pieces.

{% endbubble %}
{% bubble ChiakiPast %}
Tore to pieces—!?

{% endbubble %}
{% bubble KanataPast %}
they chopped them up, and made them into a feast—and everyone Ate a piece of it, tasty as they were. both their meat, and their blood…

it really is just like the Yaobikuni, isn’t it?

{% endbubble %}
{% bubble ChiakiPast %}
A…te…!? No, that’s too cruel!

{% endbubble %}
{% bubble KanataPast %}
is it? but fish are Food, aren’t they?

{% endbubble %}
{% bubble ChiakiPast %}
They’re not fish… Weren’t the sacrifices human beings?

{% endbubble %}
{% bubble KanataPast %}
yes. but once they became Sacrifices, they were no longer Humans.

they become Fish—beings made to be Eaten.

{% endbubble %}
{% bubble ChiakiPast %}
……

{% endbubble %}
{% bubble KanataPast %}
they ate the Sacrifice… and apparently, with that, their illness was Cured.

it Worked perfectly. and so, the Curse disappeared.

a happy ending.

{% endbubble %}
{% bubble ChiakiPast %}
<th>(… It’s probably just a fairytale, but…)</th>

<th>(If I try really hard to interpret this story rationally— Let’s say, you didn’t become infected by the disease thanks to a skilled doctor…)</th>

<th>(This means that they must have dismembered people immune to that disease, turned them into medicine, and gave it to their patients… I guess?)</th>

<th>(This would explain how they managed to cure the disease, without the use of some mysterious magic and whatnot… probably. Either way, it's inhumane.)</th>

{% endbubble %}
{% bubble KanataPast %}
but. after that Happy ending, the chieftain thought to themself: this illness might Come about again.

so, the family members of the sacrifices that never became ill were protected as Gods who rid of the curse — in other words, grant miracles.

{% endbubble %}
{% bubble ChiakiPast %}
Are those… your ancestors?

{% endbubble %}
{% bubble KanataPast %}
maybe so.

{% endbubble %}
{% bubble ChiakiPast %}
<th>(Which means, this absurd fairytale-like legend is true…)</th>

<th>(They’re a family that has been turned into Gods and guarded all the way up to the twenty-first century?)</th>

{% endbubble %}
{% bubble KanataPast %}
to be more Precise, apparently, the very first human being who was sacrificed to the Ocean returned all of a Sudden—

at that point, they had been dyed in Evil, and had turned into a Monster…

the person who was turned into a God married them, and gave birth to Children.

they are my ancestors.

{% endbubble %}
{% bubble ChiakiPast %}
<th>(That part… just sounds like a legend, yeah.)</th>

<th>(There’s no way a human being could survive after being submerged into the ocean — They must have made up that story to give the whole “God” thing more weight.)</th>

{% endbubble %}
{% bubble KanataPast %}
the person who was dyed with Evil is my ancestor, and that is why we are capable of performing miraculous deeds.

for example, there was once a Generation of a Chieftain that did not believe in the Legend.

they tried to Persecute us—only to become ill and die.

not only Them, but their family, and many other people of that Land died—is what i heard.

and the illness was finally cured, too… how Sad…

{% endbubble %}
{% bubble ChiakiPast %}
……

{% endbubble %}

## Chapter 22
{% img /img/es/eventstory/meteorimpact/secondhalfch22.jpg %}

{% bubble KanataPast %}
they learnt their Lesson, and the Chieftain after them begged for our forgiveness—

then they Promised to protect us properly Forever.

with that, everyone’s illness was cured.

i’m sure the chieftains of this Land still believe in that.

the warning and the tale is passed on from Parent to child to this very Day.

… but it is an Ancient story, so there are Many people who have forgotten all about it, it seems.

as many years passed, blood from the outside became mingled with ours… and slowly, things have been changing for us.

we must be much Weaker to our ancestors by now.

that must be why… no one believes that i am a god.

i am sorry.

… Huh? W-Why are you apologizing? I won’t call you a lying fraud, y’know? I mean, you were just raised to think of yourself as a God, right?

Which means you're not the one to blame!

{% endbubble %}
{% bubble KanataPast %}
? no… i am apologizing for being Inexperienced as a god, and for growing weaker…

if i was a god, i would have been able to grant any Wish, right?

but, it seems too difficult for me… that is why everyone is Disappointed in me, right?

that is why they’re all fed up with me, and calling me a Liar, right?

i am sorry for being weak… i am sorry for being a failure as a god.

… i’m Terrified, chiaki.

if a Meteorite comes crashing down again… and people become ill, i may not be able to Cure them.

the chance of me failing is very high. after all, i could not cure the rogue’s—mikejima’s Sister.

that is why he is Angry at me, right? that is why he has been Mean to me, right?

we were so Close in the past, but now, because i’m an Inexperienced god…!

he was the only one—the only one who would come to my Room where i had always been Alone… and secretly bring Magazines with him from the Outside world…

even when no one Ordered him to, he would play with me, too…

he Taught me many things i didn’t know, just like you… i loved all of it, so much…

but i am weak as a god, so he started to Hate me, didn’t he?

that is why he stopped coming to see me, right…?

and you, too! chiaki, you’re the Same, aren’t you? i wanted to see you, i was so lonely… but you all left for somewhere Far away!

{% endbubble %}
{% bubble ChiakiPast %}
No… No, you’re wrong, Shinkai-kun.

{% endbubble %}
{% bubble KanataPast %}
…?

{% endbubble %}
{% bubble ChiakiPast %}
Mikejima-san was trying to save you from your circumstances. But then the worshippers found out and shunned him, and forced him to keep a distance from you… I think.

You said that he brought over magazines, so maybe actions like that were seen as a problem, too.

I think you were talking about when you were kids, right…? Mikejima-san may be strong and a genius, but he’s not a God.

He must’ve made mistakes since he was still so inexperienced, and then those piled up until his position was in danger.

That’s what I think. Mikejima-san really *was* a hero… I don’t know how society would view it, but he was one—at least to you.

No, actually—Maybe this is just me imagining things, but I think he wanted to become a hero after seeing them on TV, just like I did.

Then, naturally, from devoting so much time learning from heroes… he tried to save you.

That’s why he was part of Ryuseitai. He was just like me… I think.

But he couldn’t accomplish it, so he failed… He was completely defeated by something far too large and vile…

<th>(Even Mikejima-san couldn’t win against that much evil… Can I, of all people, really stand a chance against such an old, long-lasting tradition around Shinkai-kun…?)</th>

<th>(Well, of course… He hasn’t asked me to save him, so normally I wouldn’t need to try to fight, but…)</th>

{% endbubble %}
{% bubble KanataPast %}
—is that your Wish?

{% endbubble %}
{% bubble ChiakiPast %}
Mm!? Did I say it out loud!?

{% endbubble %}
{% bubble KanataPast %}
no… for some reason, i could just Tell. a*hem*\~ this must be because I am a god~♪

{% endbubble %}
{% bubble ChiakiPast %}
No, it’s because you’re human — the same as me. You can feel empathy and understand how someone feels.

A God would probably have no interest in us, even if there really is one in this world.

No matter how much we beg to be rescued, it would never bring about a miracle.

If that’s what God is… then, even if it does truly exist, everything is practically the same as it’d be without its existence.

{% endbubble %}
{% bubble KanataPast %}
whaa~? i am *different*! i would Save you if you tell me your wish! i would bring about Miracles, and grant wishes!

that is what i have been doing all my life! that is why i am a god!

if you have any Complaints, then i shall Prove it to you! chiaki, make any sort of wish right now!

i will use all my Power to grant it!

your Wish is to become a hero… yes?

i figured that’s what you were Thinking about a second ago! because i am a god!

i will grant you that wish! right this instant!

{% endbubble %}
{% bubble ChiakiPast %}
No… You don’t need to.

{% endbubble %}
{% bubble KanataPast %}
… whaaaat!?

huh? why!? I don’t understand! please don't Hold back, please let me grant your wish!

{% endbubble %}
{% bubble ChiakiPast %}
I refuse!

{% endbubble %}
{% bubble KanataPast %}
… huh? what? why? you are only Human, yet you oppose me? i’m a god, you know? you must listen to what i say!
{% endbubble %}
{% img /img/es/eventstory/meteorimpact/secondhalfch22_2.jpg %}


{% bubble ChiakiPast %}
Never!

{% endbubble %}
{% bubble KanataPast %}
… w-why…? uuu, why don’t you want me to grant your wish? i don’t understaaand~!

{% endbubble %}
{% bubble ChiakiPast %}
Mhm, alright! Allow me to explain! Becoming a hero is not my wish — it’s my *dream*!

{% endbubble %}
{% bubble KanataPast %}
d-dream? what is that…? is it different from wishes?

{% endbubble %}
{% bubble ChiakiPast %}
That’s right! Listen, Shinkai-kun — You can’t make dreams come true through someone else! You have to work hard and make it come true yourself, or else there’s no point to it!

{% endbubble %}
{% bubble KanataPast %}
umm… ummm…?

{% endbubble %}
{% bubble ChiakiPast %}
And! There’s no point in granting your parents’ or ancestors’ dreams in their stead! Well, if your dream is the same as theirs, *then* it’d be fine!

But! Making it come true on your own is what makes a dream so sacred!

{% endbubble %}
{% bubble KanataPast %}
i-is that how it is? it is difficult to understand, but i suppose there are things like that, too…?
{% endbubble %}

## Chapter 23
{% img /img/es/eventstory/meteorimpact/secondhalfch23.jpg %}

{% bubble ChiakiPast %}
Mhm! You’re always asking me questions, so it’s about time I asked you one! Shinkai-kun, what is your dream?

{% endbubble %}
{% bubble KanataPast %}
u-um…? i-i don’t know how to respond to such a sudden question…?

ah! i see! your wish is for me to answer that question, yes?

{% endbubble %}
{% bubble ChiakiPast %}
If that’s what you want to think, then sure! Does that mean granting wishes is your dream?

Fuhaha! We’re just going back and forth with everything right now, huh!

{% endbubble %}
{% bubble KanataPast %}
ummm…? i grant wishes because i am a god. i do not know if that is what you would call a Dream or not…!

it is the same as Breathing and eating Food for me… can i call that my Dream?

{% endbubble %}
{% bubble ChiakiPast %}
That’s different! Well, it is possible to have meals as a dream if you were a kid who was starving to death!

But you’re not like that, right?

A dream! Is something you don’t have with you at this very moment! But you’ll do whatever it takes to have it within your grasp!

It’ll make you feel like you could work as hard as you possibly can without a second thought, just for the sake of the dream!

Do you not have anything like that, Shinkai-kun?

{% endbubble %}
{% bubble KanataPast %}
uhh, umm…? i’m sorry, i am still Thinking!

{% endbubble %}
{% bubble ChiakiPast %}
Hm. It just occured to me, but isn’t your dream to become an idol?

{% endbubble %}
{% bubble KanataPast %}
huh? is that so? why did you Think that, chiaki?

{% endbubble %}
{% bubble ChiakiPast %}
Well, you’re wearing the same uniform as me!

You’re in Yumenosaki's idol course, aren’t you? Isn’t that because you want to become an idol?

There's no way anyone out there would accidentally join the idol course, after all.

Why did you join the idol course? Or is this also because your peculiar household ordered you to…?

{% endbubble %}
{% bubble KanataPast %}
no… i was not given any Order to do so. i am a god, you know?

the likes of mere Humans could never Order me around.

{% endbubble %}
{% bubble ChiakiPast %}
So we’re just mere humans…?

{% endbubble %}
{% bubble KanataPast %}
ah! i am not making a Fool out of you, okay? it is just that Gods and Humans are different, we are Different existences…!

but… the Idols in the magazines and movies mikejima Showed me… i felt like they were similar to me.

i didn’t really understand what they were doing, but… it seemed as though they made everyone smile… and everyone wanted to see them more and more…

so, i thought they were Granting wishes. just like me.

i thought that they must be Gods, too! there were others like me! i was so happy! because i was always, always so lonely…!

if there are other gods, they would only Be a hindrance to my Work, but! i still wanted to meet them…!

that is why! i said that i wanted to become an Idol! that was when i was recommended to go to this school!

i took the Exam as i was asked, too! mikejima helped me with my Studies, so it was very Easy!

he had always been so Far away… but he came Closer to me again after so long, and that made me happy…

he even joined the School with Me.

but… this School was not at all what i Expected. there is not a single god around me…

it only has pitiful Human beings! and mikejima kept going someplace Far away, too!

of course, once i got to meet the Five Eccentrics, they did make that Desire come true, because they are the Same as me.

that was why we were to become Friends.

{% endbubble %}
{% bubble ChiakiPast %}
Hehe. Then your dream came true.

{% endbubble %}
{% bubble KanataPast %}
i wonder… i’m not sure — was that really my Dream?

but in reality, someone started calling us the Five Eccentrics… and it is Thanks to that that i made Friends.

which means someone Granted it for me, so it’s not a Dream, yes?

{% endbubble %}
{% bubble ChiakiPast %}
No, no. As long as it wasn’t completely given to you in its entirety from someone else, then you can still call it a dream.

After all, you worked hard to become their friend, right?

{% endbubble %}
{% bubble KanataPast %}
yes… especially shu — he was unwilling to become my Friend.

whenever i would call him my friend, he would Shout in his usual tone, *“non!”…*

so i did my very best. i Talked to him a lot, and learned what his Likes and Dislikes were…

i learned to be careful with what to say, and worked hard to make him Like me.

i Failed many times along the way, but… at some point, he began to call me his Friend.

it made me so happy… ehehe, it makes me Smile just remembering it.

{% endbubble %}
{% bubble ChiakiPast %}
I see! Then that really must’ve been your dream. It’s because you made it come true on your own that it made you so happy.

{% endbubble %}
{% bubble KanataPast %}
mm~? i don’t understand this anymore! i really can’t help but see Wishes and Dreams as the same! i cannot tell the Difference!

it is Not a dream if all of it is Bestowed on you by someone, right? then, i will make a Compromise with you!

chiaki! please tell me your Wish!

and once you’ve Worked hard for a bit, i will make it possible to Grant it!

… is that wrong, too?

{% endbubble %}
{% bubble ChiakiPast %}
No, not at all. I really appreciate it. I’m happy to hear that you want to support and help me achieve my dream.

But please, don’t use your worshippers just to help me with my dream!

If you’ll help me by yourself — if you’ll lend me a hand ordinarily, then I don’t mind!

That’s how all the people in the whole world make their dreams come true, without ever using the help of some God!

I can’t cheat my way toward it! So please, cheer me on as a friend!

{% endbubble %}
{% bubble KanataPast %}
friend… chiaki, you will become my Friend?

{% endbubble %}
{% bubble ChiakiPast %}
Hm? Yep, only if that’s alright with you! If you ever feel lonely, call for me! I’ll hug you!

Let’s do lots of fun things together! Let’s become friends!

{% endbubble %}
{% bubble KanataPast %}
… but. chiaki, you are not a god, are you?

{% endbubble %}
{% bubble ChiakiPast %}
I’m not, and neither are you. I’ll sound a little mean with how I word this, but — if you want to be my friend…

Then you have to become a human being that lives on the same surface as me, instead of a God who sits at the top of the heavens.

If it’s just you as a human being, then you’re always welcome to be my friend! Let’s become close friends that laugh, cry, and enjoy their youth together!

{% endbubble %}
{% bubble KanataPast %}
mm~ gods are not up in the Heavens, but Deep within the oceans, though…

well, i will think it through.

{% endbubble %}
{% bubble ChiakiPast %}
Okay! Tell me when you've decided! I pray that we really do become friends at some point and shake each other’s hands! ☆

{% endbubble %}
{% bubble KanataPast %}
ah! did you just say “Pray”? i see, so that is your Wish…☆

{% endbubble %}
{% bubble ChiakiPast %}
Ooh!? But that’s only a figure of speech! Making friends isn’t my wish *nor* my dream! My dream is—

{% endbubble %}
## Chapter 24
{% img /img/es/eventstory/meteorimpact/secondhalfch24.jpg %}

{% bubble MadaraPast hidden %}
“Your dream is to become a hero… right?”

{% endbubble %}
{% bubble ChiakiPast %}
—!?

{% endbubble %}
{% bubble KanataPast %}
huh? was that mikejima’s Voice just now? or was it my imagination?

{% endbubble %}
{% bubble MadaraPast hidden %}
“Hahaha! My oh my, don’t be so surprised! It’s not just your imagination, it’s your Mamaaaaaaa!! ☆”

“How absolutely joyous! You’ve been calling me a rogue for a while, but now you’re calling me by my name again!? I’m so happy, Kanata-san!

“You remembered my name!”

“That’s right! You had never needed to want *‘that’*, y’know — for you see, your friend has been here from the very staaaart!!”

{% endbubble %}
{% bubble KanataPast %}
u-ummm? where? show Yourself, manservant!

{% endbubble %}
{% bubble MadaraPast hidden %}
“I’m not a manservant! I’m repeating myself, but — I’m your friend! Or, really, I’m your Mamaaaaa!”

“Wait— But we’ll be family if I become your Mama, so wouldn’t that mean we won’t be friends? I’m contradicting myself!”

{% endbubble %}
{% bubble ChiakiPast %}
Ahhh! Look over there, Shinkai-kun! There’s something rising up from the ocean! It looks huge… Wait-- Is it a monster!?

{% endbubble %}
{% bubble MadaraPast hidden %}
“Nah, it’s not! It’s a drone that I dropped in the ocean to make it look like a meteorite.”

“Mama made every single part of it all by himself! My recipe is a secret! It’s waterproof, and to some extent, I can control it remotely from far away!”

{% endbubble %}
{% bubble ChiakiPast %}
Drone…? Ahh, it’s true! It does look like some kind of machine…? I-Is it safe to get close to it? It won’t explode, right!?

{% endbubble %}
{% bubble MadaraPast hidden %}
“Don’t worry, don’t worry, it won’t. Probably. Don’t be so alarmed, please come closer… You guys are a little too far away, and I can’t see you very well.”

“I do have a camera set up inside the drone, but—”

“In the end, people understand each other’s intentions better when they talk face to face, right?”

{% endbubble %}
{% bubble ChiakiPast %}
Mrmm… I don’t really get it, but how about we try going closer, Shinkai-kun?

{% endbubble %}
{% bubble KanataPast %}
*sigh*…

wa—ahhh—?

{% endbubble %}
{% bubble ChiakiPast %}
Are you alright!? You’re staggering a little… It’s hard to walk on sand — You can grab onto my shoulder if you like!

{% endbubble %}
{% bubble KanataPast %}
okaaay. thank you, chiaki.

{% endbubble %}
{% bubble ChiakiPast %}
Oh no, no need for thanks! When one of us is in trouble, we all are! You need no reason nor reward to help a friend! Fuhahahaha!! ☆

{% endbubble %}
{% bubble KanataPast %}
acting so high and mighty for something as Simple as this… also, we are not Friends yet, okay?

… you, too. when did *you* ever become my Friend, *rogue*?

{% endbubble %}
{% bubble MadaraPast hidden %}
“Hahaha… I was *always* trying to be that for you, though…?”

“You’re so strict towards me and only me, Kanata-san… Now that you've finally started thinking for yourself, are you going through your rebellious phase?”

“Well, no matter! Actually, it does matter, but! We don’t have much time, so I’ll cut things short!”

“First off, thank you two for answering my calls!”

{% endbubble %}
{% bubble ChiakiPast %}
Hm? It is true that you led me here through a call, but does that mean you called Shinkai-kun over too, too…?

{% endbubble %}
{% bubble KanataPast %}
no… for some reason, i am told to never Come into contact with mikejima, so…

it has been a While since i Heard from him, or even his voice.

{% endbubble %}
{% bubble MadaraPast hidden %}
“Yep! I’m so sorry for making you feel lonely, Kanata-san!”

“Ahhh, I wanna hug you so bad! I’ll at least blow kisses at you so a little bit of my love reaches you! Kiss, kiss☆”

{% endbubble %}
{% bubble KanataPast %}
just die.

{% endbubble %}
{% bubble ChiakiPast %}
Hm. So, Mikejima-san? Your… real self… is still overseas?

I can see you through the screen attached to the drone, but where is that place…? A warehouse…?

{% endbubble %}
{% bubble MadaraPast hidden %}
“Yep! I’m using a network to call you guys! I’m in Rio de Janeiro right now!”

“Hahaha! ‘Ri-o-de-Ja-ne-i-ro’ sounds like a Japanese word that comes from an alternate universe!”

{% endbubble %}
{% bubble ChiakiPast %}
Why are you in a place like that…? You really are flying all over the world, huh…

{% endbubble %}
{% bubble MadaraPast hidden %}
“Yep. In fact, even I started to find it weird how much travelling I’ve had to do, so I did some proper research…”

“It seems like Rei-san is in the same boat as me—We’ve been made to travel far away from Japan, with all the strings the Tenshouin Zaibatsu have been pulling.”

“… I should’ve noticed how unnatural this was much earlier. There’s no way a religious group native only to its land could have so many connections overseas.”

“But I guess I was in the wrong too — I think I must’ve felt like Kanata-san’s family was far too large…”

“I’ve known them from a young age, after all… so I must’ve subconsciously thought to myself that together, they’re an invincible entity.”

“I got scared and overestimated their power… So pathetic — even though I’ve grown so tall, and became so strong by now…”

“If I had just taken it seriously and challenged them without hesitation, maybe I could’ve made everything turn out differently.”

“I’m so sorry, Kanata-san… I couldn’t become your hero.”

{% endbubble %}
{% bubble KanataPast %}
……

{% endbubble %}
{% bubble ChiakiPast %}
……

{% endbubble %}
{% bubble MadaraPast hidden %}
“But whatever, I’ll keep my whining for later. I’ll look back on everything when I can’t move a single part of my body anymore… There’s no use crying over spilled milk.”

“At least for now, I’ll do whatever I can, so the same failure doesn’t happen again.”

“I won’t hesitate this time around. I’m gonna do whatever it takes to achieve my goal.”

“Kanata-san. You seem worried about it, so I’ll at least tell you this: It’s pretty obvious by now, but — what crashed down into this ocean wasn’t a meteorite.”

{% endbubble %}
{% bubble ChiakiPast %}
<th>(Meteorite… Ahh, right, his family began from one.)</th>

<th>(That must be why they’ve set up a specific method to be able to sense quickly if a meteorite is about to crash down on this land.)</th>

<th>(It’s the origin of the religious faith regarding his family… They can’t ignore the meteorite.)</th>

<th>(If by any chance it happens… In other words, if the meteorite brings with it the evil it did long ago, they can easily make contact with God.)</th>

<th>(Not that I think it would help anything if Shinkai-kun comes over to their rescue…)</th>

<th>(But trying to make logical sense out of “religious reasoning” is practically impossible.)</th>

<th>(However, if you can make sense out of it, you could use it to your advantage. And Mikejima-san did just that—)</th>

<th>(He controlled the drone and made it crash into the ocean, like a meteorite… and that’s how he lured Shinkai-kun out.)</th>

<th>(The worshippers forbid him from contacting Shinkai-kun, so he had to find another way to talk to him.)</th>

{% endbubble %}
{% bubble KanataPast %}
… hm. i see. why did you do this then?

a Meteorite is no Joke to us, you know?

{% endbubble %}
{% bubble MadaraPast hidden %}
“Hahaha! Within Ryuseitai is a meteor![^22] So I made a hoax about a meteorite crashing down from the sky and onto the earth…♪”

{% endbubble %}
{% bubble KanataPast %}
… *<th>(glares)</th>*

{% endbubble %}
{% bubble MadaraPast hidden %}
“… That’s not the real reason, of course. I’ll stop cracking jokes, so please stop trying to break the camera, Kanata-san!”

“I’m done joking around now, really!”

{% endbubble %}
## Chapter 25
{% img /img/es/eventstory/meteorimpact/secondhalfch25.jpg %}

{% bubble MadaraPast hidden %}
“Chiaki-san.”

{% endbubble %}
{% bubble ChiakiPast %}
Y-Yes? D-Did I do something!?

{% endbubble %}
{% bubble MadaraPast hidden %}
“Why’re you acting so surprised… You’re as timid as always — although that has its own cute charm to it.”

“I called you ‘cause I have a favor to ask of you, of course.”

{% endbubble %}
{% bubble ChiakiPast %}
Me…?

{% endbubble %}
{% bubble MadaraPast hidden %}
“Yep. Chiaki-san, I’ll make you into a hero.”

“There’s a ship coming over to you guys soon.”

“In it, there are Kanata-san’s worshippers, but among them is someone I took as much time as necessary to train in order to become a spy.”

“I want you to cooperate with that person, and take Kanata-san to his home, where it’s safe.”

{% endbubble %}
{% bubble KanataPast %}
my… house?

{% endbubble %}
{% bubble MadaraPast hidden %}
“Yep. You’re in the center of this whirlpool, so it will probably be hard for you to understand why… but I’m sure Chiaki-san will.”

“Kanata-san is in a very unfavorable position in Yumenosaki right now.”

“He was chosen as the second Oddball to be subjugated… and they’re trying to publicly execute him through the live show that’s about to start.”

{% endbubble %}
{% bubble ChiakiPast %}
… You know a lot even when you’re overseas, huh?

{% endbubble %}
{% bubble MadaraPast hidden %}
“Hahaha, nobody holds their tongue in this day and age! If I ever wanna know something, there’s plenty of ways to get the info.”

“Like logging into the school’s social media through a student’s account who I blackmailed…”

“It seems like Rei-san and I— and anyone else who’s overseas —are denied access to social media.”

“Well, Rei-san just doesn’t like using electronics, but *I* personally can find all kinds of loopholes in the internet.”

“On the other hand, Kanata-san’s family hasn’t kept up with the modern times, so I can’t figure out what they’ve been up to through the internet alone…”

“But, whatever — nevermind that for now.”

“The Student Council folks are completely serious about making this war happen. They’re gonna do whatever it takes to crush Kanata-san — the one appointed as the antagonist, and the evil.”

“I dunno how it is in school right now, but by reading the school’s social media… I don’t see any place that he could belong within school.”

“Being in that place will only get you minced up — like your ancestors from long ago that were made into sacrifices.”

{% endbubble %}
{% bubble KanataPast %}
……

{% endbubble %}
{% bubble MadaraPast hidden %}
“And with that, Yumenosaki will be revolutionized, and we begin a beautiful, peaceful new era! Yep, yep! You need sacrifices to accomplish that, don’t you~♪”

“… It’s absolute bullshit.”

{% endbubble %}
{% bubble ChiakiPast %}
I think so, too. I see, so that’s what this was about…

I thought a tale of good and evil was happening, but I see now… it was all a scheme planned by the Student Council…

I’ve been believing in and cheering on people like that…?

I was under the belief that they would change this world for us…

{% endbubble %}
{% bubble MadaraPast hidden %}
“The world will probably change, yeah. But, for that change to happen, there are people being turned into sacrifices.”

“There are people who have been shedding tears on the other side of history… and the one who saves those people is the hero, right?”

“You may think differently, Chiaki-san, but that’s how I see it.”

“I honestly don’t care for justice from a ‘fair’ standpoint. Even if they’d been turned into evil within society, I *will* be the ally of those precious to me.”

“I don’t care if I’m called a villian for it.”

{% endbubble %}
{% bubble ChiakiPast %}
… I think you’re a wonderful hero, Mikejima-san.

That’s exactly why you’re also dressed *that* way, right?

{% endbubble %}
{% bubble MadaraPast hidden %}
“Hm? No, no! I needed this uniform for work, that’s all!”

“I figured no one would use it, so I stole it from the AV room, since that’s become Ryuseitai’s storage area!”

{% endbubble %}
{% bubble ChiakiPast %}
You should get permission first… I suppose you can’t choose your methods for your goals, but… you should do the proper procedures no matter what.

If you just keep doing what you like, you’ll lose all your allies.

{% endbubble %}
{% bubble MadaraPast hidden %}
“I’m fine with me being my only ally. Besides, no one would be upset if I took it, would they? I mean, I chose the color that barely makes an appearance in Super Sentai shows, y’know?”

“There were a bunch of other uniforms in red, blue, and other common colors, sooo… Chiaki-san, feel free to use any of them if you need to.”

{% endbubble %}
{% bubble ChiakiPast %}
Really…? Then I’d like to wear the red uniform. Though it probably doesn’t suit me with how I am right now.

{% endbubble %}
{% bubble KanataPast %}
? i don't quite understand, but i would like blue~♪

{% endbubble %}
{% bubble ChiakiPast %}
Ahaha, you’re not part of Ryuseitai, y’know~… Ah, but wait? Hrmm? It *would* suit you, though…?

<th>(Huh, wait… I think I have a great idea.)</th>

{% endbubble %}
{% bubble KanataPast %}
Um? err… so, i should go Back home, yes?

it is true that the School is suffocating right now, so… i would like to go home.

{% endbubble %}
{% bubble MadaraPast hidden %}
“Mhm. You don’t need to become a sacrifice. Just hide somewhere safe.”

“And then, once things calm down, and you still feel like being an idol, I’d like you to come over to my place. No—I’ll come pick you up from your house, and we could go there together.”

{% endbubble %}
{% bubble KanataPast %}
mikejima’s… place? is that Outside the Ocean…?

{% endbubble %}
{% bubble MadaraPast hidden %}
“Yep. See, there’s an acquaintance I know here, and apparently they’re gonna make a whole new agency.”

“A young, new idol agency, that is controlled by neither Yumenosaki, nor the rumored CosPro…”

“We’ll have a re-do with our time as idols in that agency. We’ll even get to have our whole youth there.”

{% endbubble %}
{% bubble KanataPast %}
… that…

{% endbubble %}

“And anyway, truthfully, I don’t even know if they’re gonna manage establishing it or not.”

… the fact that i Was one of the five Eccentrics… will become a Problem, won’t it…

to Idols, we are the Absolute worst… we are Infamous for being Evil, aren’t we…?

no agency’s Manager would ever accept such an idol…

{% bubble MadaraPast hidden %}
“… I’m gonna do something about that.”

{% endbubble %}
{% bubble KanataPast %}
no. that itself would be a Problem.

you are not one of the five Eccentrics… you are not the least bit Tainted… you are still Clean.

i can understand that now… just by Talking to you a little.

you never changed, did you? you are a Kind person, mikejima.

the mama Role none of the other young Boys ever wanted to do—

you yourself took on that Role when we were playing House, for my sake.

and then, while everyone Feared me as their god… *you* Taught me about many things, when i knew nothing.

that is the type of person you are… so i cannot Burden you any more than this.

it is your Dream to become an idol, isn’t it?

it would only be Sad if you were turned into a Villain along with Me and lost your dream, all because of me… wouldn’t it?

{% endbubble %}
{% bubble MadaraPast hidden %}
“… Nah. I was never interested in idols — I just joined Yumenosaki to take care of you, the Living God, y’know?”

“So! It’s perfectly fine if I fail to become an idol! ‘Cause I never had any interest in becoming one, anyway!”

{% endbubble %}
{% bubble KanataPast %}
… liar.

if that is the case. then why were There idols in the Magazines you would always bring over…?

{% endbubble %}
{% bubble MadaraPast hidden %}
……

{% endbubble %}
{% bubble KanataPast %}
mikejima. thank you for trying to Protect me until the very end.

no matter what anyone says, *i* at least will never call you evil or a monster.

you are my hero…… but, enough of all of this.

i will quit being an idol.

apparently, idols and gods are different from each other, but… if no one is in Need for me, then i may as well not Exist.

i will go back home, and live as usual there for the rest of my life. i will live within the Depths of the ocean forever.

the dragon king palace’s Banquet is over. it was always such a Strange concept, anyway—*me*, becoming an idol.

i could not even become a proper god, and lost hold of my religious faith…

there was no chance someone like me could ever be capable of becoming Something else.

{% endbubble %}
{% bubble ChiakiPast %}
… Like a transformation[^23], huh.

{% endbubble %}
{% bubble KanataPast %}
mm? what is it, chiaki?

{% endbubble %}
{% bubble ChiakiPast %}
I see now. You were the same as me.

{% endbubble %}
{% bubble KanataPast %}
what are you on about…? um, it makes you Happy to know we are the Same, yes?

{% endbubble %}
{% bubble ChiakiPast %}
Yep! Really happy!

Mikejima-san!

{% endbubble %}
{% bubble MadaraPast hidden %}
“W-What?”

“Wait, uh, this is a little strange… The ship should’ve arrived by now — Don’t you guys see anything above the ocean…?”

“Mrmm… It seems like the Student Council’s scheme to make everyone stop having faith in Kanata-san… has had a horrible ripple effect on his worshippers — even worse than the ones within school.”

“Whatever’s happening behind closed doors is getting really out of hand.”

“So there’s a chance the worshipper I trained into a spy switched sides against us, or they may no longer be capable of helping us.”

“But I already came up with a backup plan: ask Chiaki-san to escort you instead. I can trust you, Chiaki-san.”

“If the ship doesn’t come to pick you up, then I apologize for taking up your time, but I’d like you to shelter him in your own home for a while.”

“I was already considering asking you to do that in the case the ship *does* arrive, but everyone in there is in disarray and tries to harm Kanata-san… or even if you just sensed something bad from them.”

{% endbubble %}
{% bubble ChiakiPast %}
So that’s why you called for me… I have no means of retaliation if they start attacking us, y’know? I’ll only get beaten down — I’m weak when it comes to fighting, I’m not like my friend.

{% endbubble %}
{% bubble MadaraPast hidden %}
“No, there’s no need for you to fight. Just call for the police.”

“You’ll be able to talk to my dad if you just mention my family name, and they should bring over support in only a few minutes.”

“I’ve already asked him to be on standby for it. … He’s still my parent, more or less, so he’ll probably do what I asked of him.”

{% endbubble %}
{% bubble ChiakiPast %}
But then, why didn’t you just ask your parents to escort Shinkai-kun from the start, instead of me…?

{% endbubble %}
{% bubble MadaraPast hidden %}
“I can’t trust them that much… Please just know that my parents are always my last resort.”

“Both of them are worshippers themselves, and don’t see me, the problem child, in good light.”

{% endbubble %}
{% bubble ChiakiPast %}
I see. You should get along with your family more. Don’t you have things you should be doing before calling yourself a “mama” and playing house?

{% endbubble %}
{% bubble MadaraPast hidden %}
“That hurts to hear, haha… But anyway, wasn’t there something you were about to say?”

{% endbubble %}
{% bubble ChiakiPast %}
Ah, yes. I have one favor to ask, Mikejima-san.

{% endbubble %}
{% bubble MadaraPast hidden %}
“Sure, let me hear it. Tell me anything, since I owe you big time now.”

{% endbubble %}
{% bubble ChiakiPast %}
Thank you! … You see, there’s something I’d like to try.

So I want to postpone the escorting for later — please do forgive me for that.

I’m sure it won’t be too late to give up and run away *after* trying everything you can do first.

{% endbubble %}
{% bubble MadaraPast hidden %}
“Oh? Interesting. What is it that you wanna try?”

{% endbubble %}
{% bubble ChiakiPast %}
I don’t have enough time to explain. The “Battle versus the Sea God” performance will end if we don’t go there soon.

{% endbubble %}
{% bubble MadaraPast hidden %}
“Battle versus the Sea God? Isn’t that the live show for executing the ‘Oddball’, Kanata-san…?”

{% endbubble %}
{% bubble ChiakiPast %}
Mhm. I’m thinking of going there right now. … with Shinkai-kun.

{% endbubble %}
{% bubble KanataPast %}
huh? me too? why? but wait, isn’t a Ship coming…? shouldn’t we Wait for it?

{% endbubble %}
{% bubble ChiakiPast %}
We’re not going to go on that ship. Ah, no—maybe if this doesn’t work out, then we should rely on that plan, but— Nah, actually, I already feel like this isn’t going to work, since it’s something *I’m *trying to do.

But! Shinkai-kun, you said it yourself, didn’t you? You said that if no one is in need of you, then you may as well not exist!

But there’s no need to worry! Because I’m here!

{% endbubble %}
{% bubble KanataPast %}
whaa…?

{% endbubble %}
{% bubble ChiakiPast %}
I want to see you as an idol! I want to see the version of you that isn’t a God!

After all, I told you that we should be friends… yet I still know nothing about you!

I want to know more! I want to see more of you, in different ways! Let’s talk about our favorite color! Our favorite food! I’m going to keep saying it — Let’s become friends…!

{% endbubble %}
{% bubble KanataPast %}
i-is that your w—

{% endbubble %}
{% bubble ChiakiPast %}
No, it’s not a wish! It’s a promise! I vow on the bright red sunset!

{% endbubble %}
{% bubble KanataPast %}
huh..? it is Night time right now, there is no Sunset..?

{% endbubble %}
{% bubble ChiakiPast %}
Don’t worry about the details! Don’t just give up and act like you've gone cold! Be more passionate—more burned up…!

No! *I’ll* make you passionate! I’ll revive you myself! Not just that—Let’s live on, together! We were finally able to meet each other — I don’t want to say goodbye like this…!

{% endbubble %}
{% bubble KanataPast %}
…? …??

{% endbubble %}
{% bubble ChiakiPast %}
C’mon, let’s go!

<th>(… Incorrigible! Where did this intense air come from!?)</th>

<th>(The audience is acting bizarre. It doesn’t feel as though they’ve gone crazy with intoxication from watching our performance—)</th>

<th>(—No, actually, they *have* been reacting erratically to every single move we make.)</th>

<th>(Their cheers are abnormal — as if they’re frenzied, thirsting for blood.)</th>

<th>(We selected our audience carefully, yet I can hear many of them causing a commotion when they should be following the stage regulations instead.)</th>

<th>(They keep screaming “kill them,” “viva la revolution,” and the like… This is no longer an idol performance, this may as well be a rally for war.)</th>

<th>(… There was a strange atmosphere to this live show before it had even begun.)</th>

<th>(All I needed to do was make it obvious that we defeated and subdued Shinkai Kanata of the Five Eccentrics.)</th>

<th>(We don’t need more than a few witnesses to confirm our deed, then have it documented officially.)</th>

<th>(All we have to then do is use that fact efficiently and publicize it to suit our agenda.)</th>

<th>(That’s why I’ve chosen to make it an S2 — a live show limited within the school premises. I did the bare minimum of advertisement for the performance, and I even chose to hold it during night-time, an inconvenient timing for students.)</th>
{% endbubble %}
{% img /img/es/eventstory/meteorimpact/secondhalfch28_1.jpg %}


{% bubble KeitoPast %}
<th>(I also set the tickets to an expensive price, and announced that the regulations to obtain one would be strict.)</th>

<th>(Yet… they still sold out in mere seconds.)</th>

<th>(We had to implement the regulation system immediately after the announcement, thus, we had to spend far too much time inspecting the tickets… It left my plans a mess.)</th>

<th>(But that’s alright, this workload is necessary.)</th>

<th>(We have to be absolutely certain we don’t lose, so I worked hard to ensure none of our guests are the Yaobikuni worshippers, as they may cheer for Shinkai instead.)</th>

<th>(It was impossible to get rid of their religious faith entirely, and they aren’t the type that can switch to worship a different God. That’s why it was an extra step I *had* to be sure that we completed.)</th>
{% endbubble %}
{% img /img/es/eventstory/meteorimpact/secondhalfch28_2.jpg %}


{% bubble KeitoPast %}
<th>(*Hah*. I must say, this is truly horrible of us. The DreamFes seems to be fair on first glance, as long as victory is declared based upon the number of votes…)</th>

<th>(But the Student Council is in charge of managing and planning any DreamFes — there are plenty of ways to influence the votes however we need to.)</th>

<th>(It doesn’t take much to make a fixed match. And by expanding the system within the school and making good use of it, we would have the power to defeat the unrivaled geniuses, the Five Eccentrics—)</th>

<th>(Or at the very least, we can mark that as a victory in the records.)</th>

<th>(People who weren’t present for the performance can only know what happened through the official announcement, which only displays the final result.)</th>

<th>(“The Student Council won against the Five Eccentrics,” “the Student Council is stronger than the Five Eccentrics”—)</th>

<th>(Without a doubt in their mind, they’ll believe that. And, swayed by what the officials say, they will start cheering for us.)</th>

<th>(The more supporters we have, the easier it’ll be to win DreamFes, and so the cycle begins.)</th>

<th>(The Student Council force will be able to continue their advances without problems, and eventually defeat all the Eccentrics as per planned. I must say, we’ve cooked up quite a good scheme here.)</th>

<th>(But something about this makes me uneasy — this plan is going *too* well… In fact, the students are glorifying us and bashing the Five Eccentrics far more than I had anticipated.)</th>

<th>(It’s baffling to see how far they’re going, even when *we’re* the ones who prompted them to act this way.)</th>

<th>(Within the school, vitriol overflowing with animosity towards the Five Eccentrics has been flung around, and just the mere presence of *fine* causes a shower of cheers.)</th>

<th>(I did assume this would eventually happen, but… this change is much too drastic.)</th>
{% endbubble %}

<th>(All of you students, allow me to ask: Why have you gone this berserk?)</th>

<th>(Did you have *that* much resentment pent up for the Five Eccentrics? Have you loathed them from the bottom of your hearts all this time?)</th>

<th>(While it is true that bitterness and envy drives a person mad… Most of the students within this school were mere imitations of idols — they didn’t even have the motivation to perform basic idol activities.)</th>

<th>(And the Five Eccentrics were above everything else, and were a nuisance for it — in other words, business rivals. It’s no surprise people would feel jealous — at least, the idols who worked hard every day would have.)</th>

<th>(But all of *you* are different, aren’t you?)</th>

<th>(None of what the Five Eccentrics did mattered to you people; you were satisfied as long as you could take it easy in the school, weren’t you?)</th>

<th>(That is why we had intended to stir a little bit of emotion within the apathy of the people in public.)</th>

<th>(If we lowered the public’s opinion of the Five Eccentrics slightly, and improved how favourably they view the Student Council in exchange—)</th>

<th>(We would be able to win the DreamFes through the voting system. With each victory, we become the ones in power, and become capable of changing history however we like.)</th>

<th>(That was all we had planned… so why are you howling with so much rage and malice?)</th>

<th>(Why are you so intent on cheering for us, and cursing at them?)</th>

<th>(Something isn’t right here… It’s as if they’re going through mass hysteria — like swathes of people raging over the injustice done to them, just before heading into war.)</th>

<th>(… That reminds me — my parents were mumbling their words for once—)</th>

<th>(But I could hear them saying something about the legend of this land… That the evil within the meteorite had amplified the negative emotions of the people.)</th>

<th>(They added that it was more akin to a curse than an illness.)</th>

<th>(Would that mean that this is my fault…? By devising a tactic to subdue Shinkai Kanata of the Five Eccentrics, I’ve made the evil come back once more…?)</th>

{% endbubble %}
{% bubble SoumaPast %}
Indeed you did. I have no right to be standing on this stage; I am akin to a ruffian running amok.

I have been exiled from Akatsuki… Therefore, I have come here to speak as myself, bearing the family name that I have inherited from my ancestors.

Nay! I speak to you as a fan of you and Kiryu-dono—of Akatsuki! What an unsightly state you present! I misjudged you!

You are both entirely distracted, and neither of you have smiled even once! You are not in the least bit synchronized with the song!

I know not what has intoxicated you, but watching your staggering, nearly inebriated movements is unbearable!

{% endbubble %}
{% bubble KeitoPast %}
—!

{% endbubble %}
{% bubble SoumaPast %}
I may have lost the right to call myself a member of Akatsuki, but I am still an “ai-dol”!

I am one of you, as well as your long standing foe! O travellers of the same path of dreams! I shan’t let either of you negate that about me, no matter how much love and respect I hold for you two!

And as I see it, Akatsuki does not have the right to call itself an “ai-dol yu-nit” right now! Such insolent drunkards should not disgrace the name of Akatsuki!

Ahh, I want nothing more than to cover my eyes from this disastrous scene! Perhaps I should cut you down in a fit of anger!?

Straighten your back! Smile, even if you do not want to! Do it for the sake of your guests!

Present yourself whole, and utter every lyric you sing with as much passion—as much soul as one could muster!

Is that not what you two had taught me, back when I knew nothing…!?

Hey Danna, he just told you off. Ain’t ya ashamed of yourself?

You ain’t gonna start actin’ indifferent after bein’ criticized that hard by a chick that hasn't even grown feathers, are ya?

He’s pickin’ a fight, so let’s accept his challenge.

‘Course, we’ll be the losers here if we lose ourselves to anger and start throwin’ punches — and “he hit me first” ain’t gonna cut it as an excuse. But a nerdy young master[^25] like yourself would know that much at least, right?

{% endbubble %}
{% bubble KeitoPast %}
… Of course I do.

He’s right on one part: I was caught in a delusion. I couldn’t effectively wave off the *klesha*[^26] plaguing my mind, when I’m meant to perform here on stage…

It doesn’t matter how bizarre or unimaginable this situation is, the guests are still our guests. It’s our duty to ensure our guests are satisfied.

I understand how it feels to be a parent who gets taught by their own child. It seems I still need much more training than I had thought.

Kanzaki.

{% endbubble %}
{% bubble SoumaPast %}
Is there a *problem*? I spoke what was on my mind, and I refuse to apologize for anything! I am far beyond furious right now, I feel as though my beloved katana has been smeared with filth!

{% endbubble %}
{% bubble KeitoPast %}
… And yet, you never change. You always remain straightforward and clean — like a polished katana.

Even if those “evil things” existed, it would surely never have an effect on you.

They say that it amplifies one’s negative emotions, but it could never manage to do so if those emotions never existed inside the person in the first place.

{% endbubble %}
{% bubble SoumaPast %}
? But I can also feel negative emotions…? There are times when I cry, and times when I am angry! I am a human being, after all!

And it is for that reason that I am capable of forming thoughts, for as long as my head stays intact! I felt awful being ridiculed by you… and began to wrack my brain as hard as I could!

You are currently in the middle of a performance, so I will withhold the details, but! Your reason to dispose of me was justified, for you are always in fair judgement!

I had forgotten what it means to be loyal, and attempted to deceive the person I claimed as my lord!

Were this during a certain era, it would have only been natural to be ordered to slice my stomach open! In fact, I am more than grateful that you allowed me to live with a mere exile!

{% endbubble %}
{% bubble KeitoPast %}
About that exile… I’ll be retracting your banishment.

{% endbubble %}
{% bubble SoumaPast %}
… What? Pardon?

{% endbubble %}
{% bubble KeitoPast %}
Or, rather, I haven’t even done the procedures to banish you from the unit. I was too preoccupied with other matters.

If you’re still up for it, then go change into your uniform — There’s a spare sewn by Kiryu in the dressing room.

{% endbubble %}
{% bubble SoumaPast %}
What!? You prepared an outfit for me, too, Kiryu-dono!?

{% endbubble %}
{% bubble KuroPast smile %}
Sure did. I mean, I didn’t even expect ya to get “banished” in the first place, so I got three outfits stitched up.

Even our songs need three people to perform, so — we can’t get this place goin’ without ya.

No more of this politics and war strategy nonsense — Let’s win this fight by singin’ and dancin’ like idols should.

Once we do, this punk self of mine can finally be reborn as the person I’ve dreamed of bein’.

I’m sure you can tell that we’re a mess right now, Kanzaki… so help us out, will ya?

{% endbubble %}
{% bubble SoumaPast %}
… R-Roger! Why, of course I will, that is exactly what I was hoping you would say! But as a man who was wrongfully disloyal to you, I could not say it myself!

It has nothing to do with what my ancestors say! I simply wish to sing as part of Akatsuki right now!

You both appear weak and pale at the moment for some reason, and so I shall be your right-hand blade, much like a final trump card!

Wait just a moment! Nay, not even that — for I, Kanzaki Souma, shall hurry back as I were Skanda himself![^27] Fuhahahaha…! ☆

{% bubble KuroPast smile %}
… Haha. He’s so happy, like a li’l kid who got his new year’s gift.

It was almost enough to fool me into thinkin’ I’m a good guy for doin’ a good deed.

But you alright with this, Danna? You really lettin’ him come back? Didn’t you want him away from all this dirty work?

{% endbubble %}
{% bubble KeitoPast %}
I’ll be sure to avoid keeping him near that type of work, obviously. I’ll keep him far away from the swamp through any means necessary, even if it’s by reworking the documents.

But you saw him yourself, didn’t you?

He leapt all the way into our stage in the middle of our performance. Who knows what he’d do if we leave him alone — it’s too dangerous.

That’s why we have to keep a close eye on him. No—It’s our *duty* to do so. We have to put on a strong front now that we have someone who admires us.

We’ll become seniors that he would be proud to have. That will be our repayment to him for saving us out of this delusion.

I won’t lose my way anymore. *I’m* the one who started all of this, so I’ll be sure to accomplish my goal without any complaints.

And I’ll need both of you to help with that.

Especially on stage. I may still be inexperienced, but I can fight if I’m not alone. I could kill any God — so let’s show them the power of human beings.

{% endbubble %}
{% bubble KuroPast smile %}
Haha, sayin’ that’ll get you damned to hell, Mr. “son of a temple”.

But y’know, I don’t dislike that about you.

Even the part about you that rambles on and on about borin’ logical stuff, but as soon as somethin’ makes ya happy, it all just blows away from you.

{% bubble ChiakiPast %}
Let’s hurry, Shinkai-kun! There was a huge commotion near the auditorium, I think the “Battle versus the Sea God” has already begun…!

<th>(Battle versus the Sea God, huh… It’s probably an extension of the Dragon King Competition, the one Kiryu was in many times and likely got hurt in the process…)</th>

<th>(Now they’re doing a special version of that for defeating their most powerful enemy, the Five Eccentrics.)</th>

<th>(“Sea God”… At first glance, it looks like the most suitable name for Shinkai-kun, but you can also read it as “monster”.[^28] I feel like that was what Akatsuki, the Student Council force, was aiming for…)</th>

<th>(Shinkai-kun isn’t even a God, let alone a monster… I don’t quite like the naming, but for now, I need to—)</th>

{% endbubble %}
{% bubble KanataPast %}
chiaki~? was this what you were Looking for?

{% endbubble %}
{% bubble ChiakiPast %}
Ohh! That’s it, that’s the one! It was exactly as Mikejima-san said — Ryuseitai’s uniforms were all in the AV room!

Whew, I’m glad. I was worried I’d have to buy one of those idol uniforms the school’s been selling recently.

Though, any outfit would’ve been fine, really. But I wanted to change into these if I could.

{% endbubble %}
{% bubble KanataPast %}
i see. i’m glad\~ i am very Good at Finding things. i am a god, after all~♪

{% endbubble %}
{% bubble ChiakiPast %}
… Uh-huh… Um, yes, you were a big help. Thank you.

{% endbubble %}
{% bubble KanataPast %}
you would like Red, yes? i think it’s This one, here you go~♪
{% endbubble %}
{% img /img/es/eventstory/meteorimpact/secondhalfch30_1.jpg %}


{% bubble ChiakiPast %}
Yeah…… Shinkai-kun, I have a question.

Does this uniform suit me…?

{% endbubble %}
{% bubble KanataPast %}
huh? i think the Size would Fit you just fine…?

actually, i think the material is Strong enough to be Handled a bit roughly, too?

you should be able to Wear it, and i’m sure it would Fit you. i do not know if it would have fit you a year ago, but right now, you will surely be good enough for it.

that is why. please take it. you always wanted to Wear it, didn’t you?

{% endbubble %}
{% bubble ChiakiPast %}
… Yeah, I did. I’ve always longed to wear it.

<th>(Ryuseitai’s uniforms… They were hidden deep, deep down in here, huh…?)</th>

<th>(We’ve been degrading—trashing our legacy bit by bit, doing nothing but fooling around—until we’d gone completely rotten…)</th>

<th>(But even then, there were treasures preserved within that precious, unbroken legacy of ours, free from the taint and tarnish.)</th>

<th>(And I’ll inherit it. It seems like no one else wants to, so *I* will.)</th>

<th>(No! I’ve chosen to inherit the passionate spirit of justice because I *want* to!)</th>

Aaalright, time to change! Urmm, how do you wear this…?

{% endbubble %}
{% img /img/es/eventstory/meteorimpact/secondhalfch30_2.jpg %}
{% bubble KanataPast %}
shall i help you, chiaki?

{% endbubble %}
{% bubble ChiakiPast %}
Wha!? W-Why did you change, too!?

{% endbubble %}
{% bubble KanataPast %}
? huh? am i not Allowed to…?

{% endbubble %}
{% bubble ChiakiPast %}
No, um…? It’s not that—actually, it suits you way more than I thought, but--! Shinkai-kun, don’t tell me you’re going up on stage…!?

{% endbubble %}
{% bubble KanataPast %}
mrm… if that is what you Want, then i will. i was already planning on Performing in the live show, anyway.

but my worshippers kept Wishing for me to not Perform—

they forcibly Distanced me from it, so i thought it would be too Difficult to manage it.

but if i can Perform there, then i want to. i want to take Vengeance, on behalf of shu, as well.

since he is my Friend.

… but they Wished me not to, so i shouldn’t go Perform, should i?

am i a failure as their god…? mm…?

{% endbubble %}
{% bubble ChiakiPast %}
… So that’s how it is.

{% endbubble %}
{% bubble KanataPast %}
huh? what do you mean?

{% endbubble %}
{% bubble ChiakiPast %}
Ah, no, just talking to myself. Hmm… I’m going to be honest: I didn’t actually want you to perform on stage.

At the moment, practically every student in the entire school irrationally hates the Five Eccentrics.

If you go up on stage, they might start to berate you, and possibly even throw rocks at you.

I can’t take you into such a dangerous place, so I was planning on fighting alone.

I was going to tell you to lock yourself in this room for shelter, and just wait until it’s over.

Once I was done, I would have escorted you back to the beach… so that I may fulfill Mikejima-san’s request.
{% endbubble %}
{% img /img/es/eventstory/meteorimpact/secondhalfch30_3.jpg %}
{% bubble KanataPast %}
……

… you were planning to Substitute for me…? to go Up there, and have Rocks thrown at you in my stead?

you were planning on becoming the Sacrifice, chiaki?

{% endbubble %}
{% bubble ChiakiPast %}
When you put it that way, you make me sound like I’ll honorably sacrifice myself, which sort of feels weird… But, you see — while this isn’t something I’m proud of, I’m actually used to being in horrible situations.

And that’s exactly why— *I’ll* become the monster subjugated in your stead.

{% endbubble %}
## Chapter 31
{% img /img/es/eventstory/meteorimpact/secondhalfch31.jpg %}

{% bubble KanataPast %}
… you want to become a hero, don’t you?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble ChiakiPast %}
Yep. That’s what I plan on becoming. The world may see me as a monster, but I will become your hero.

I’ll become a being who can take the pain in place of the persecuted victims, and fight to protect them.

{% endbubble %}
{% bubble KanataPast %}
is that what you Desire? is that your Dream…?

didn’t you say that Dreams are something much more Sacred…? that is how i Understood it, but was i wrong?

{% endbubble %}
{% bubble ChiakiPast %}
… I can’t think of any other way to become one.

But that doesn’t mean I can sit still and do nothing about it. You heard it on our way here, didn’t you? The cheering of a pure, innocent kid…

I’m never going to betray those cheers again.

I *am* terrified, though. It’s pathetic, but my legs won’t stop shaking.

But even if I’m scared — if even one single person believes in me, then I want to become a hero.

{% endbubble %}
{% bubble KanataPast %}
… i really can’t see the Difference between heroes and gods, but—

i understand. i am the Same as you. it makes me Happy to know we’re the Same… that is what you taught me.

that is why i will Go with you. it *is* my Battle, after all.

and besides, i’m wearing such a cool Uniform… i don’t want to Hide without having done anything, as if i’m dead.
{% endbubble %}
{% img /img/es/eventstory/meteorimpact/secondhalfch31_1.jpg %}


{% bubble KanataPast %}
i wanted to get involved… even if it meant i got hurt. that is why i came out from the bottom of the Ocean.

i didn’t really want to go back inside… back to the Bottom, where there’s no one else — where it’s quiet, and lonely…

{% endbubble %}
{% bubble ChiakiPast %}
Is that your “wish”?

{% endbubble %}
{% bubble KanataPast %}
ah! that’s my Line, you know!? you can’t Steal it from me~ okay, chiaki?

{% endbubble %}
{% bubble ChiakiPast %}
Ah, sorry. …… All I’ve been doing is apologizing.

I want to change that about myself, so I’m going to thank you instead. Thank you for letting me know your true feelings.

Thank you for understanding how I feel, and for wanting to come along with me.

… I messaged the other Ryuseitai members just now.

I told them I’m going to participate in the live show as Ryuseitai, and that they can help out if they’d like.

No one replied. Of *course *they wouldn’t, they all shun me… and none of them would want to get hurt for no reason.

But you know, that’s exactly why I’ve steeled my resolve to see it through.

I *will* do this, even if I’m all on my own. If there’s even a slight chance I could become a hero, then I’ll reach out to take it.

If I lose the chance I have now, I’ll just end up a boring, whiny coward for the rest of my life.

But that’s not what I want to become… I want to become a *hero*.

That’s why I’ll go there. Honestly, I don’t recommend joining me, but if that’s what you prefer to do, then — I’ll respect your feelings, just like you respected mine. It’s reassuring, and it’ll help me out a lot.

Don’t worry about the rage and hostility they might sling at you — I’ll take on as much of it as I can. Or no— at the very least, I’ll share that burden with you.

It makes me so happy to be able to do something heroic like that.

Let’s go, Shinkai-kun. From here on out, we’re our very own superhero squad!

{% endbubble %}
{% bubble KanataPast %}
okay. … ah, please wait. you have to change before that.

{% endbubble %}
{% bubble ChiakiPast %}
Oh, you’re right! Sorry! I’ll go transform immediately!

{% endbubble %}
{% bubble KanataPast %}
“transform”… you keep saying that. it is an Important thing to do, yes?

{% endbubble %}
{% bubble ChiakiPast %}
Yep! No matter how pathetic someone is, as long as they transform, they can save anything, even the world!

{% endbubble %}
{% bubble KanataPast %}
hm… please let me borrow that thing you call a Phone for a second.

{% endbubble %}
{% bubble ChiakiPast %}
Huh!? I don’t mind, but why?

{% endbubble %}
{% bubble KanataPast %}
just do it. hm, hm… thankfully, my body is Dry, so i will not be breaking it.

as for how to use it— i learned that from seeing everyone use them.

{% endbubble %}
{% bubble ChiakiPast %}
Mm…? I don’t really understand, but I’ll go change for now, okay?

{% endbubble %}
{% bubble KanataPast %}
okay. … alright, it is perfect~♪

i will return your Phone now.

{% endbubble %}
{% bubble ChiakiPast %}
Alright… Who did you message, and for what?

{% endbubble %}
{% bubble KanataPast %}
heheh. i gave mikejima a Job to do. he is an important Person within ryuseitai, yes?

i got him to allow me in ryuseitai with that Authority.

he promised to do all the Procedures necessary for me, so it should be Fine.

{% endbubble %}
{% bubble ChiakiPast %}
Join Ryuseitai? You… you’ll join…?

{% endbubble %}
{% bubble KanataPast %}
it is only for this one Occasion. the dreamfes Rules say you cannot fight Together unless you’re in the same Unit.

i want to fight alongside you. and i want to Prove to you that i’m not Lying.

{% endbubble %}
{% bubble ChiakiPast %}
I see… You’re completely welcome to do so, Shinkai-kun.

No, allow me to call you by this name! Ryuseitai’s new warrior, Ryusei Blue!

{% endbubble %}
{% bubble KanataPast %}
“ryusei blue”… is that me? did i stop being “shinkai kanata”?

that is a strange feeling… but i do not Dislike it.

{% endbubble %}
{% bubble ChiakiPast %}
Yeah! You’re wearing the uniform, after all — so let’s both be reborn as new beings!

I’ll become Ryusei Red! I may not be capable enough to call myself that yet, but—

I’m still much better suited for the role over those who cower away from fighting and pretend nothing’s happening when the time has come!

That’s what I’ll make myself believe in! And even though I’m terrified, I’ll still fight with everything I have!

I will never, ever regret that I made this decision—that I made this choice for myself!

*—“Transform”!*

<th>(You must’ve been terrified about the legend from the olden days, after learning about it from your parents and seeing the state of your household… But I’m happy to see that you were still able to overcome that fear to come dashing back to us.)</th>

<th>(And I was so cruel to you, too… I bragged about protecting you for your sake, yet only emotionally hurt you in the process.)</th>

<th>(Yet, despite all that… you still want to serve me.)</th>

<th>(You are a true samurai—a man of loyalty. I’ll be sure to reward you for your service.)</th>

<th>(I’ll ensure our victory for your sake, and enlist you on the side of the victors. After all, with the current condition we’re in, we’ll be able to perform as per planned.)</th>

What is the *meaning* of this, Morisawaaa!?

{% endbubble %}
{% bubble ChiakiPast %}
Oh! You finally learned my name!

No matter when and where we met, you would always forget it for some reason — it made me feel blue, because I was worried it meant I was simply that worthless to you!

{% endbubble %}
{% bubble KanataPast %}
blue? aren’t *i* blue?

{% endbubble %}
{% bubble ChiakiPast %}
Yes! I leave that color to you now, so I’ll no longer be blue!

{% endbubble %}
{% bubble KeitoPast %}
Shinkai--? *You,* too!? Why!? Why must you interfere with my plans!?

Why did you come here!? If you hadn’t shown up, we would have won by default! I would’ve been able to end this with as little sacrifice as possible!

{% endbubble %}
{% bubble KanataPast %}
“why”… because i wanted to, i think?

please ask the Difficult questions to chiaki! because i Don’t know!

but i *want* to know, so! i will have the hero teach me!

{% bubble KeitoPast %}
*“Hero”*? Why do the lot of you try to become something that doesn’t even *exist*…!?

That’s a wish too great for a human body to bear! Your desire to do so will only tear everything apart!

{% endbubble %}
{% bubble KanataPast %}
mm~? it is not a Wish, but apparently a Dream, temple guy?

{% endbubble %}
{% bubble ChiakiPast %}
That’s right! It’s a promise, and a vow! I’m going to make the dream I’ve envisioned since childhood into a reality — right here, right now!

“Hello, everyone! Good evening! You’re probably wondering who I am, so I’ll start by introducing myself! I’m Ryuseitai’s Morisawa Chiaki!”

“*No!* In fact, I’m a *hero* that’s part of that unit—my name is Ryusei Red…! ☆”

{% endbubble %}
{% bubble SoumaPast %}
What even— B-Buchou-dono? Are you alright!?

{% endbubble %}

“buchou-dono”? i don’t know who that is. my name is “ryusei blue”, you know?

{% endbubble %}
{% bubble SoumaPast %}
Huh? Umm…?

{% endbubble %}
{% bubble KanataPast %}
souma. it’s alright. i’m sure you heard the Legend when you were young… and it must have been terrifying for you.

{% endbubble %}
{% bubble SoumaPast %}
Y-Yes… From a young age, I have had many hellish nightmares of the town being dyed with evil.

I was terrified that it would become a reality if anyone were to lay a hand on you.

Thus, I committed treachery, all in an attempt to avoid the calamity once more.

{% endbubble %}
{% bubble KanataPast %}
it was Unnecessary, souma.

i’ll say this once again: it really is alright. even if Evil does spill out once more, i *will* do something about it.

i’m a god for that reason. i was protected for that reason… and that is why everyone had Faith in my existence for a Long, long time.

i’ll accomplish my Duty when the time comes. i will be the one to protect you all.

{% endbubble %}

{% endbubble %}
{% bubble ChiakiPast %}
“Fuhahaha! Ryuseitai are both heroes and idols!”

“They crush the strong and save the weak! They come running towards anyone in need of rescue! No matter what happens, they’ll make sure to protect you!”

“I won’t ask you to have faith in us — after all, we’re not Gods to revere!”

"But I want you to have *hope* — to understand that heroes like us exist in this world!”

“We’re here for you! When you’re feeling hopeless and paralyzed, but still choose to hold your head high to avoid shedding tears—”

“I want you to know: a star *will* shoot across the sky at that moment!”

“*We* are shooting stars![^30] Even if you wish upon us, it might not necessarily be granted!”

“We’re still too weak and inexperienced! We only have a few people with us who share the same ambition!”

“But we’ll still do our absolute best! So cheer for us! Call for us whenever you’re in trouble!”

“Don’t hold back! You’re free to call for us, ‘Ryuseitai’…!”

“To everyone here! You are all idol students from an all-male high school — which means all of you were once little boys who admired heroes!”

“So you know exactly what to do, don’t you? Call for the heroes whenever you feel you might cry!”

“Stop relying on God for help! That kind of thing doesn’t exist! And the person standing here—Shinkai-kun is just another human being who has worries of his own, who can cry and feel pain!”

“But that’s alright! Because the hero is here!”

“And so! Don’t sulk because ‘God’ hasn’t granted your wish! Don’t get angry!”

“Don’t call him a fraud or liar! That’s just cruel, y’know!? You’re *way* off base here!”

“Instead! If you have any complaints or frustrations — you bring them to me…!!”

“Toss all your anger and malice towards Shinkai-kun at me instead! I’ll take it head-on, and then I’ll learn what to do better from now on — I’ll work my hardest and improve myself!”

“I’ll do everything in my power! So please, I beg of you!”

“Stop hurting each other! Nothing good comes from fighting! Haven’t you all been taught this by the very people you admired as a kid!?”

“At least, *I *was! That’s why I’ll become the very same being who taught me all these important things long ago!”

“Those non-existent heroes are practically powerless in this reality, and they can’t do a single thing for you no matter how much you cry for help!”

“That’s why everyone starts to doubt heroes — that’s why they call them liars!”

“I can’t bear to watch that happen — No, it’s not only that! It’s because I want to repay their kindness, for teaching me everything important to know—”

“That’s why I’ll be protecting their dignity! If there are no heroes in this world, then *I’ll* become the hero!”

“I’ll keep saying it — the hero is right here!”

{% img /img/es/eventstory/meteorimpact/secondhalfch33.jpg %}

{% bubble KuroPast smile %}
… Haha. I dunno what happened to you, but you’ve bounced back stronger, haven’t ya, Morisawa?

You don’t need to yell it so loud — I’ve *always* known you were a real cool hero.

<th>(But that’s going to be a thorny path for you, Morisawa. The students aren’t actin’ normally right now — they’re completely blinded by malice.)</th>

<th>(They’ll gang up on you if you throw yourself out to them like that.)</th>

<th>(Look around you— everyone in the audience came here to crush the wretched Five Eccentrics.)</th>

<th>(No matter how much sincerity your speech holds, you won’t be able to stop them — not when they’re in such a frenzy.)</th>

<th>(All those raised fists will turn towards you instead.)</th>

<th>(… Hm, then I guess I’ve got no other choice. If that’s what they’re gonna do, then I just gotta protect ya.)</th>

<th>(I’ll make sure of it this time— I’ll protect my treasured friend in a respectable way—without a single shred of violence.)</th>

Hasumi.

{% endbubble %}
{% bubble KeitoPast %}
… Hm. I was a little shaken after seeing such an unexpected sight, but — our plans haven’t changed. We’ll do what we must, carefully.

“Morisawa. Sorry to interrupt your excitement, but it’s not your turn.”

“According to DreamFes regulations, performances begin from the unit with the least amount of track records.”

<th>(I’ll have to change the regulations to avoid such an unexpected scenario from happening ever again…)</th>

<th>(I’ll change it so that the units with the highest track record in DreamFes will perform first.)</th>

<th>(We don’t mesh well with the concept of an opening act[^31], but… I’ll be able to move the game pieces forward on the board however I see fit.)</th>

“Ryuseitai has hardly done any activities, and thus, is much lower than us Akatsuki. In other words, your turn has already ended.”

“You’ve lost this DreamFes. You didn’t perform in the allocated time for your unit, so you have zero votes.”
{% endbubble %}
{% img /img/es/eventstory/meteorimpact/secondhalfch33_1.jpg %}


{% bubble KeitoPast %}
<th>(But… Even so—)</th>

“… I’ll permit Shinkai’s enlistment into Ryuseitai for this performance.”

“He was working on his own, so I had announced his unit as ‘unknown’ for the time being.”

“That meant he could perform on stage with whichever unit he preferred — Ryuseitai included.”

<th>(Originally, had Shinkai participated— he would have attempted to perform alone, unable to join a unit…)</th>

<th>(And thus, lose in the Battle versus the Sea God, as I made it a rule that one must be in a unit to participate.)</th>

<th>(We would have been able to win against him, even if he were to break free from his worshipper’s wishes.)</th>

<th>(Mmm, no— That’s still what has happened here.)</th>

<th>(After all, we won in the end. We defeated Shinkai Kanata of the Five Eccentrics, and advanced our revolution one step forward. Now, all we must do is announce that fact, and we will commence with cleaning up the aftermath.)</th>

“Nevertheless, your turn is still over… and you’ve still lost.”

“So stand back at once. You said what you wanted to say, didn’t you, Morisawa?”
{% endbubble %}
{% img /img/es/eventstory/meteorimpact/secondhalfch33_2.jpg %}


{% bubble KeitoPast %}
<th>(… There’s no need for you to bear the brunt of their malice any longer.)</th>

<th>(Yumenosaki is acting bizarre right now — at this point, the mobs of students might be driven to annihilate you out of sheer fury.)</th>

<th>(In this washed-up world, overflowing with malice, you did everything you could for the sake of other people, with no ulterior motive.)</th>

<th>(A good-natured person like you should never get hurt for no reason.)</th>

<th>(Ahh… How can we even call ourselves the “Student Council” when we can’t even protect the earnest, good-natured students we have…)</th>

“Kiryu, Kanzaki, we’re still in the middle of our song. We’ll be singing until the very end. Ryuseitai, get back — we’ll end this performance and conclude our battle.”

{% endbubble %}
{% bubble KuroPast smile %}
“Gotcha. Get back, Morisawa. We already got what you wanted to say.”

“I’m cheerin’ for ya. Go ahead and tell me if there’s anythin’ I can do for you, ‘cuz this Kiryu Kuro of Akatsuki will make sure he’ll be useful for ya.”

“We’re friends, after all. Whatever concerns you concerns me, too — if anyone ever messes with you, just tell me—”

“I’ll clean ‘em up with my own two hands~♪”

{% endbubble %}
{% bubble SoumaPast %}
“Hehe, it appears that attempting to torment the man known as Morisawa is an act equivalent to picking a fight with Kiryu-dono…”

“My oh my. Personally, I would never be able to conduct such a terrifying act~♪”

<th>(Hehe, how magnificent. As I thought, my seniors in Akatsuki are not tyrants fond of brutality… Even in a bizarre state, they continue to do their best to achieve what is right without relenting.)</th>

<th>(It is exactly for that reason that I shall serve them. Not because my parents have ordered me to, but because I *want* to.)</th>

<th>(With sincere loyalty! I shall become Akatsuki’s blade!)</th>

<th>(Now then, how has the audience been responding…?)</th>

<th>(…? How strange. They were excessively berserk only a moment ago — and yet, they are now quiet, as though cold water was thrown on them—)</th>

<th>(As if they have become possessed by a spirit.)</th>

<th>(His voice is so divine and otherworldly, I could not even tell it was a person’s voice at first!)</th>

<th>(As soon as the audience heard him, they fell in a trance, despite having been dyed in malice—)</th>

<th>(Their expressions became akin to a youth of their age — as if a curse has been purified through a *kagura*[^32] performance.)</th>

<th>(Could it be… *that*? I contemplated the truth of the legend for a long time, only to conclude it was nothing but a fairytale…)</th>

<th>(But this spectacle… this unbelievable, miraculous phenomenon—)</th>

“Ahh… Don’t worry, we haven’t died. We may have lost, but you haven’t killed us without mercy, either.”

“In fact, we’re going to start living from now on.”

“We’ll live on. I was fortunate enough to make an irreplaceable comrade who’ll walk by my side—and who’ll chase after the same dreams with me.”

“Don’t say it’s only for this ‘one occasion’ — Let’s always sing together from here on out… Shinkai-kun~♪”

## Translation Notes
[^1]: It’s very likely they’re talking about [HiMERU](https://ensemble-stars.fandom.com/wiki/HiMERU).
[^2]: In Japan, number four on the basketball uniform signified the captain. You can read more on the numbers [here](https://chouseisan.com/l/post-52236/) (It's in Japanese).
[^3]: Chiaki has been referring to Subaru with *kimi* up until this point, when he switched to *omae*. Both mean “you”, but *omae* is more rough and informal than *kimi*, so it gives off a much more casual or close feel. But it can also be rude to refer to someone with *omae*, since it’s typically used towards someone below you, which may be the reason behind Subaru’s reaction.
[^4]: In the original, Subaru trails off before he elaborates, so it’s unclear whether he was asking a question or stating something. He was definitely going to follow up the sentence with a verb, so it’s possible that it was “Do you know anything about my dad?” or “Did you hear about my dad?” or something similar. It’s free for interpretation.
[^5]: As a fun fact, Chiaki uses the word *chuunibyou* here, and the gacha that came with this event was Chuunibyou.
[^6]: Chiaki uses the word *usohappyaku* 嘘八百 to say “lies and fabrication”, which share the same kanji used in *yaobikuni* 八百比丘尼.
[^7]: Originally, Kanata misunderstands and says *seire…i?*, as in spirit (精霊), because Shu says *seireen* for “siren”. I changed it to “psyche” to somewhat fit a similar pronunciation as “siren” in English.
[^8]: Apparently, [there was a muse that did come from the water, and sometimes they’re referred to as water nymphs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muses).
[^9]: This is an expression to say that even scary-looking people feel compassion, as well as being a reference to Kuro’s last name, as it has the kanji for “demon” (鬼).
[^10]: A reference to what happened in the flashback chapter in Gang (Chapter 3).
[^11]: Rogue in Japanese is *gorotsuki* ごろつき, which has various negative connotations, such as someone who loiters around with no fixed home or job of their own, or who takes advantage of people’s weakpoints, or threatens others with force.
[^12]: Souma is doing a *dogeza*.
[^13]: Souma’s family name 神崎 has the kanjis “God” and “cape (on the coast)”.
[^14]: ぶちょ～, a more drawn out way to say *buchou*, meaning “club captain”.
[^15]: The [Zaibatsu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zaibatsu), which is business conglomerates in Japan.
[^16]: He calls Souma a *chuunibyou*, because it has the kanji for “illnesss”.
[^17]: Referring to [Yama](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yama_%28Buddhism%29).
[^18]: “Mysterious” here is the same word used in Ryusei Blue's catchphrase 神秘(性).
[^19]: Originally *oyabun* 親分, which can mean a father, and also an (evil) boss.
[^20]: Monsters here is *kaijin* 怪人, a common word in tokusatsu shows. It refers to an antagonistic humanoid with supernatural abilities. This word will be elaborated in detail in the coming chapters.
[^21]: The chapter title for the second year era is called *hero shikkaku* ヒーロー失格 in Japanese, literally “Disqualified/unsuitable as a hero”, and can be translated as “failure as a hero” (see: Kanata’s dialogue earlier in the chapter). But due to Chiaki’s epiphany here, I decided the best way to translate the title is to go with “Unqualified Hero”.
[^22]: The *ryusei* in Ryuseitai means “meteor” (and of course, means “shooting star”).
[^23]: Chiaki uses the same word that tokusatsu heroes say before transforming: *henshin* (Translated as *“Transform!”* much earlier in this story, and sometimes in other Enstars stories too.)
[^24]: The Little Mermaid is *ningyo hime* 人魚姫, literally “mermaid princess”.
[^25]: Kuro refers to Keito as *obocchan* here.
[^26]: [Klesha](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kleshas_(Buddhism)) is a buddhist term referring to a negative mental state (and polluting thoughts).
[^27]: [Skanda](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skanda_(Buddhism)), who is known to be a fast runner.
[^28]: 海神 (Sea God) is read as *kaijin*, the same pronunciation for the word 怪人 (monster). As mentioned in a previous chapter, this is a common word in tokusatsu shows, and it refers to an antagonistic humanoid with supernatural abilities. This wordplay is why I chose to translate the live show’s name as “Battle versus the Sea God”.
[^29]: You can hear a voiced version of this line <a href="https://files.catbox.moe/9m58c7.mp3" target="_blank">here.</a>
[^30]: As mentioned before, the *ryusei* in Ryuseitai means “meteor”, as well as “shooting star”.
[^31]: In entertainment, opening acts are known to be usually done by the lowly ranks.
[^32]: Information about Kagura [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kagura).
[^33]: Keito is referring to how Buddhism views life after death.
