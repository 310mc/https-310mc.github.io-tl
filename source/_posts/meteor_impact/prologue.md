{% bubble Chiaki %}
Fuhahaha! Mission accomplished! It’s an incredible victory for Ryuseitai once again…! ☆
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata %}
yes~♪ this is the Result of everyone’s combined powers! an incredible victory for ryuseitai…!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki %}
Kanata…! ♪ <th><em>(Offers a handshake)</em></th>
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata %}
chiaki…! ☆ <th><em>(Hugs him instead)</em></th>
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki %}
Fuhahahaha~! <th><em>(Both twirl around)</em></th>
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
Ughhh… Those two are acting stupidly hyper again… This is so depressing, I wanna die…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shinobu %}
Ahaha, maybe their exhaustion has put them in a strangely hyper mood. They said that they had been cleaning nonstop for the entire day.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
Ehhh? Why would they do a huge cleanup like that *again*…? Are they trying to escape into the night together…?[^1]
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora %}
Actually, hold on! You two were being so reserved about this! You could’ve told us from the start — We would’ve helped you out!
{% endbubble %}

{% img /img/es/eventstory/meteorimpact/prologue_1.jpg %}

{% bubble Kanata %}
reserved? like a reservoir? for water? do you want to Talk about water, tetora…!?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora %}
N-no! I meant reserved in a different way![^2] Please don’t cling to me when you’re in that weird hyper mood, Shinkai-senpai~!?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata %}
fufufu\~ i am a Fish, so i will nab at any Bait within my sight… a fish that takes each and every piece of bait, yes yes\~♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora %}
Ahaha, I bet you enjoy fishing…

I used to go fishing for black bass with my dad when I was young. But we haven’t been doing it lately, cuz of busy schedules.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata %}
waa, really? you should have told me earlier, it would have been an exciting Conversation!

Black Basses aren’t that Tasty, but they’re Fun to fish, yes~? ♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
Umm… This might be a dumb question, but… You call yourself a fish, but you don’t seem to have any problems with catching and eating fish, do you…?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata %}
yes, fish are Food, after all~
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shinobu %}
That sounds like cannibalism to me… Uuu\~ I just imagined something terribly graphic.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki %}
Heeey! I’d love to chat all night, but it’s dark outside now. We’ve finished our work, so it’s time we call it a day!

You’ve all done an excellent job today!

Let me embrace each and every one of you as a reward for all your hard work…! ☆
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
Ah, I’ll pass.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shinobu %}
Ahaha, the season has become very chilly — I would love some warmth~

However, please do not make light of us, Taichou-dono. We did not work hard just because we wanted a reward!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki %}
Ohh, I see…♪ My bad, Sengoku! I wasn’t trying to insult you guys! That’s right, you did this all in the name of justice, didn’t you!?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shinobu %}
It is not just that. It is as you always say, Taichou-dono — <em>All for one, one for all</em>~♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki %}
No matter what the reason is, I’m ecstatic over you three! Over your growth! And the spirit of justice swirling with flame in your hearts…! ☆

Ahh, I can’t hold myself back anymore! I need no reason! I just *have* to embrace all of you right this instant! I’ll start with you, Nagumooo…! ☆
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora %}
Gaah—!! Why me!? Please spare us, Taichou! I’m really tired from the huge cleanup work — I don’t wanna use any more of my energy by playing around~!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki %}
No problem, no problem at all! Our youth is our strength! As well as something to never fret about! Fuhahahaha! ☆
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora %}
Owow, owowowow!? Be a little gentle at least, please! If you don’t calm down anytime soon, my karate hands will start erupting fire~!
{% endbubble %}

{% img /img/es/eventstory/meteorimpact/prologue_2.jpg %}

{% bubble Shinobu %}
<th>*(whispering)*</th> Midori-kun, Midori-kun. Is it just me, or is Taichou-dono acting a little strange today?

<th>*(whispering)*</th> He is constantly hugging us over anything, like he is far more hyper than usual…?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
<th>*(whispering)*</th> Uh? I’m pretty sure he’s always been like that.

<th>*(whispering)*</th> Wait, why’re you even asking me… I’m honestly so exhausted, I can’t even use my brain… Shinkai-senpai has been with Morisawa-senpai longer than me, hasn’t he… You should ask him…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata %}
yeees? did you call for me, midori~?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
Wha—!? You heard our whispers? You have good hearing, Shinkai-senpai…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata %}
do i? hmm, a god is one that hears Everything, you see…?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shinobu %}
…? Huh? A God is what? I apologize, Shinkai-dono. You speak with strange intonations, so there are times wherein I cannot comprehend what you are trying to say!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata %}
i am often told~ is my Voice hard to pick up?

i would be Sad if i were misunderstood, so i have been trying to talk as Clearly as possible Lately…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
No, your voice is very clear, but… Sometimes it’s hard to understand what you’re trying to say, I guess…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata %}
i see… it’s lonely when we cannot understand each other…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
Ahh, no! We just haven’t been trying hard enough, I think…!? Please don’t make that face, Shinkai-senpai! I’m so sorry for not being able to understand it well…!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata %}
fufu. why are you apologizing? you’re a strange Child, midori~♪

but, i am Happy to know that you’re trying to Understand me.

you really are similar to how chiaki Used to be.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
I get that often for some reason… Honestly, I don’t like being told that, and it only confuses me… I mean, we’re nothing alike, like, aren’t we complete opposites…?

Which part of us is even alike…?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata %}
ah— now that you mention it… hmm, i suppose it’s your Kindness?

which means, All you three Children are similar to chiaki…♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shinobu %}
Yaaay! That is such an honor! But you are also extremely kind, so you resemble him, too! We are all one and the same here in Ryuseitai~♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata %}
…i am not kind.

gods don’t save Human Beings out of kindness.

that was another thing that chiaki taught me. no… every valuable thing — it was all taught to me by a hero.[^3]

## Translation Notes

[^1]: In Japan, it’s common to do an entire cleanup of your house or other before the new year begins.
[^2]: Tetora says <em>mizukusai</em> (水臭い) for “reserved”, which has the water kanji in it, and Kanata jumps on it immediately. I tried to show that in the English translation, too.
[^3]: This story is a great time to mention something about Kanata and the word “hero”: Kanata always talks in full hiragana (he turns katakana words to deformed hiragana spelling). The only word he always says in the correct way it’s spelt is “hero” (ヒーロー, in katakana).
