Right. Allow me to recap our current situation, as well as explain our plan from here on.

A few days ago, Valkyrie — The stagnant powerhouse regarded as the number one unit in the entire academy — was defeated by our fellow unit *fine*.

Valkyrie represented the old era — and was led by Itsuki Shu of the Five Eccentrics, no less. Having subjugated him is a significant feat.

*fine* won with astoundingly better results than Valkyrie — No one could object to that fact.

This was the majority’s opinion. Or at the very least, the DreamFes system is designed to make everyone think that it is.

According to the DreamFes votes, the entire student body — the *public* wanted this result.

We managed to deal with the aftermath perfectly, too. We prepared everything in secret for that aforementioned day.

The Five Eccentrics are the evil that must be exterminated — And we, the Student Council, and the public supporting us, are part of justice.

That is the tale we’ll be writing. The real truth doesn’t matter.
{% endbubble %}

{% img /img/es/eventstory/meteorimpact/secondhalfch13_1.jpg %}

{% bubble Keito v2 %}
“The Five Eccentrics are to blame for why us normal students suffer misfortune and unfulfilling lives.”

“Thus we, the student body, will join forces and eradicate the root of evil.”

“And with that, we will build a new era.” — That is the revolutionary tale of good and evil that we’ll make *everyone* believe, so that they have no more doubts.

I’ve laid out the entire plot. In fact, that is what I have been doing this whole time: preparing and refining everything specifically for this tale.

The result was decided before the war had even begun. The only thing left to do is to dance to the tale's tune until the end.

We have to hurry as much as we can. Eichi, as well as *fine*, are burning through their energy faster than I expected. It’s only natural, as they’ve been going around trampling and destroying people.

As long as they have conscience inside of them, they won’t be able to handle doing so much longer.

Eichi is more physically disadvantaged than others. Time won’t be kind to us… We have to decide our next move in a flash.

We’ll put an end to everything, while everyone is agitated and caught up in the heat of the battlefield — and before the public wakes up from their reverie.

The faster we finish the job, the better. Any second longer, and everyone will drop to an irreversible doom.

We’ll strike swiftly and precisely.
{% endbubble %}

{% img /img/es/eventstory/meteorimpact/secondhalfch13_2.jpg %}

{% bubble Keito v2 %}
However, I doubt we’ll have an easy time from hereon. We were able to lead Valkyrie into a trap, and defeat them with a surprise attack—

But there were only three people in that unit, and they were in their own closed world. That was why it was possible to annihilate them in one blow.

As for the rest of the Eccentrics… Sakasaki Natsume is far too inexperienced at the moment, but the other three have built a deep foundation of their own within the academy.

Each of them have their own devotees. It’s highly possible that we’ll gain animosity were we to “assassinate” them the same way we did to Valkyrie.

The dead would only become the heroes instead. It’s *us* who must become the heroes, and *they* who become the wretched demons that we must defeat.

I’ve kept this factor in mind for the next set of the plans… And so, the next Eccentric to subjugate will be Shinkai Kanata.

I had considered Sakasaki Natsume at first, as he’s still far too inexperienced, and thus, much weaker to the rest…

As well as Hibiki Wataru, since he’s entirely infatuated with theater, and barely performs any idol activities—

But the order that they are subjugated is crucial. If we were to aim for Sakasaki first, the other Eccentrics would join forces to oppose, due to their favoring him.

At the moment, we would be at a disadvantage were they to do so. They still have far too many devotees.

In order to aim for Sakasaki, we have to first defeat more Eccentrics, and reduce their influence…

This way, even if they were to join forces, they wouldn’t be able to win against us. I prefer aiming for him only after that outcome has been decided.

As for Hibiki, his lack of proper idol activities is a worrisome factor.

This means we still have no idea what his true abilities are as an idol.

I don’t understand why Eichi thinks so highly of that eccentric, but…

In the case that Hibiki *does* have some hidden skill within him, then he may retaliate were we to recklessly attack.

If even the slightest possibility of that could happen, then our odds of winning are still low. We must tread carefully with this plan.

It isn’t too late in the game to eradicate Hibiki *after* we learn everything there is to know about him, including his true identity.

We’ll leave him for later. This means that our next target to subjugate is Shinkai Kanata.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kuro past %}
…And what about Sakuma? Did you just forget ‘bout him, Danna?

If you’re worried one of them could turn the odds in their favor, then he’s the exact guy who could, even if he was the last one left.

I know none of ‘em are easy opponents, but he’s definitely the first guy we need to get rid of, ‘cause he’s so freakin’ strong.

I know the DEADMANZ live feels like it happened long ago, but you can’t tell me you forgot all about it.

He turned everythin’ around at the very moment you thought you won, and you lost to him so badly that it almost made you cry— remember?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Keito v2 %}
It did *not*. However, I simply don’t see a single chance of winning against Sakuma Rei at the moment.

I can’t shake off the doubt in my heart — That all my planning and preparation would simply go to waste, just like how it did in my miserable defeat at the DEADMANZ live—

I feel as though I would end up dancing in the palm of his hand yet again, just like how I always have since our early childhood.

I do feel as though it has turned me into sort of a sore loser, though, which does frustrate me…

But that’s exactly why I left this job for Eichi. He’s currently using all his influence and power to fully block off Sakuma Rei.

He just finished with the battle against Valkyrie, and thus requires time to recuperate from the fatigue…

…That’s why, in the meantime, we Akatsuki will support the war front.

In fact, it *must* be us who eradicate Shinkai Kanata.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kuro past %}
…What d’you mean?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Keito v2 %}
You don’t know? Shinkai Kanata of the Five Eccentrics, as well as the Yaobikuni group of his, are a religious force.

They are bound together by a faith that we cannot grasp, nor have any sight of.

Religious faith is founded on emotional support. Subjugating Shinkai Kanata means we are attempting to rob *that* from them.

The worshippers in Yaobikuni are all the frail students who could do nothing but depend on God…

Which means that they make up the public. We can’t let *fine* be the ones who drench themselves with the blood of the people in the public. After all, they’re meant to be the protagonists of this tale—the heroes.

They’re heroes through defeating the monsters, but were they to massacre the people, then they would only become vicious madmen.

Therefore, it must be us to do it. Akatsuki is in charge of the dirty work.

## Chapter 14

    <p>Verbal abuse, and mentions of violence ahead.</p>
</div>

{% img /img/es/eventstory/meteorimpact/secondhalfch14.jpg %}

{% bubble Keito v2 %}
Religious faith has no shape or form — That’s exactly why we can’t use realistic measures to compensate for it with something like money.

Eichi is the son of the Tenshouin Zaibatsu[^15], and so, he’s extremely capable with such pragmatic situations—

However, we’re dealing with a formless, ghostly concept here— There aren’t many feasible ways to approach this matter. The one who’s suitable to face things like this is me, since I’m the son of a temple.

I’ve already finished the preparations. Shinkai Kanata is on thin ice, alongside the Yaobikuni—the cult holding onto a questionable faith.

Just watch. No—Follow after me without a word, and I’ll tell you all about my strategy for this religious war.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Souma worried %}
H-Hold on a moment, Hasumi-dono!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Keito v2 %}
…What is it, Kanzaki. You were listening to me without uttering a word, so I assumed it meant you had nothing to say on the matter.

Is there something you wanted to bring up? Or actually, let me be blunt: is there a *problem* with what I'm saying?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Souma worried %}
A problem…? No, I would never have any objections to your words, Hasumi-dono.

You have bestowed upon me a place of belonging, and led me to a pathway. I am greatly indebted to you; that is why I pledged an oath to obey your word.

If it is what you wish, then I shall repay you. If you order me to do so, then I have no choice but to become your blade.

I will do anything for you. I would not even object to tainting my hands with blood.

That is what it means to show loyalty—to be of service to someone. That is the discipline I have been raised with. Once you have ascertained your lord, then you mustn’t oppose them—
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Keito v2 %}
Oh? Well, this is a surprise. You really are quite the actor, Kanzaki.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Souma worried %}
…? *<th>(surprised look)</th>*
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Keito v2 %}
You almost had me fooled. How brilliant — Allow me to compliment your skills.

To think all that anachronistic talk you speak was nothing but empty words — a means to achieve your true goal.

I had simply chalked you off as proof that the world has all kinds of people — including people living like the samurai of the olden days.

But it was never like that, was it? The thought that there could be someone who’s *loyal* to you in this day and age… It’s absolutely absurd.

You really are just another foolish liar.

You were simply a fraud — The bushido way of life and the Japanese spirit are nothing more than a lost sense of value, only found in ancient scripts.

But I won’t blame you. You see, it’s only natural for it to be this way — After all, there isn’t *any* place for a samurai to be in this generation.

You did the best you could to pretend to be a samurai who holds himself proudly, and let yourself indulge in the selfish desire to feel honorable.

It’s just like measles — You simply have one of those illnesses[^16] one suffers through during puberty. There’s no point blaming the ill, *I’m* the fool here for believing that you were a real samurai.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Souma worried %}
N-No…! I was never trying to decieve you! I have always felt this way from the bottom of my—
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Keito v2 %}
Shut up, you traitor!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Souma worried %}
—!?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Keito v2 %}
…Did you really think I didn’t know a single thing?

Did you really think I was *that* stupid? You must think so lightly of me, it honestly makes me sad… Hmm, Kanzaki?

Did you think my glasses were just for show? That I can’t actually see anything through them?

You fabricated your report on the Yaobikuni, didn’t you?
{% endbubble %}
{% img /img/es/eventstory/meteorimpact/secondhalfch14_1.jpg %}

{% bubble Souma worried %}
……
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Keito v2 %}
You asked me to leave it to you, so I complied. And yet, this is how you repay me, Kanzaki.

Your report was well-written, but nobody could ever fool me *or* the King of Hell.[^17]

He’ll pull your tongue out for being a liar.

You wrote your report cleverly, tried to make me believe that the Yaobikuni and Shinkai Kanata were harmless, and would pose no threat to us.

But you see, I enjoy reading, which means I’m extremely good at reading between the lines. I read through your intentions, and found the inconsistencies in your report by comparing it to reality — to the tale that was happening around me.

Then I compiled my speculations, and asked my parents to teach me what there is to know — and thus, learnt of the tradition that revolves around this land. I landed on only one conclusion—

Kanzaki. You denied it, but you were just another one of those worshippers infected by the religion of this land.

That’s why you attempted to protect the Living God Shinkai Kanata, so that no harm reaches him.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Souma worried %}
……
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Keito v2 %}
I won’t think of this as you biting at the hand that feeds you. Obviously you, a worshipper, would try to protect your God.

To you, that is simply the most natural thing to do — it’s common sense to you. You probably didn’t even consider that it would be a crime to deceive me in this way.

That’s what religion is — what faith means.

You can’t beat it with logic, no matter how hard you try — No common sense, no justification could win against the foundation that simply says “That is how God wills it.”

That’s why I’ve given up on the thought of lecturing you with sincerity, or even exposing your deceivery.

I have no expectations from you any longer… There's no way to compromise if we believe in different Gods.

Instead, I thought I would let you do as you please, so I could then use you to my advantage.

But you didn’t notice that, because you let your guard down after thinking you had me fooled.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Souma worried %}
…? *<th>(surprised look)</th>*
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Keito v2 %}
I’ve already come in contact with Shinkai Kanata in secret. It was one of the first steps I took.

And, like a machine made to perform only one function, he asked me for my wish—

So I answered him with this: “Tell your worshippers that the reason you’re capable of granting wishes is all due to the Student Council.”

Shinkai immediately agreed to grant it. That’s the kind of living thing he is — he will grant *any* wish.

He won't think twice before granting it — you ask, and he grants.

Don’t you see? Ever since then, every miracle Shinkai has been granting comes back to being because of us, the Student Council.

*We’re* the ones saving those lost, troubled students, not him.

And as you know, Shinkai grants even the most unbelievable wishes.

Miracles that we could never make a reality on our own, not when we were so weak — Surely there must be people who thought that way.

This is where you came in handy.
{% endbubble %}
{% img /img/es/eventstory/meteorimpact/secondhalfch14_2.jpg %}

{% bubble Souma worried %}
……
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Keito v2 %}
Kanzaki. You acted as a person of virtue, aiding Shinkai in his daily duties perfectly.

Many people caught sight of you going there and back from visiting him.

And you’re a member of Akatsuki, the Student Council force. We heavily emphasized this about us in every live show we’ve performed.

…Were you happy you were appointed an important role by us?
{% endbubble %}
{% img /img/es/eventstory/meteorimpact/secondhalfch14_3.jpg %}

{% bubble Souma worried %}
……
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Keito v2 %}
But the truth is far different. As *if* I’d appoint a traitor with anything. You’re nothing but a disposable pawn to me.

Thus, we displayed to the public that you were not only a member of the Student Council force, but also connected to the Living God Shinkai.

And that helped increase credibility to the “fact” that *we* are the ones to thank for all the wishes being granted.

People would start to connect the dots: you, a member of the Student Council force, is helping out the Living God—

I can only hope this would eventually make them believe that Shinkai Kanata is nothing but a convenient tool to us.

Though in reality, there obviously hasn't been any dealings between us and Shinkai.

But you see, he maintains his faith through being mysterious.[^18] There’s never a *logical* explanation provided to how he grants wishes.

That’s why his worshippers will try to find their *own* explanation. As soon as a single doubt appears in their mind, more will follow after, and then it will be our victory.

Soon, they’ll think to themselves, perhaps the one saving them wasn’t Shinkai Kanata, but the Student Council all along.

## Chapter 15

    <p>Verbal abuse, and mentions of child abuse and violence ahead.</p>
</div>

{% img /img/es/eventstory/meteorimpact/secondhalfch15.jpg %}

{% bubble Keito v2 %}
Hey, Kanzaki. You went quiet — Are you alright? Can’t you at least respond? Or is it difficult for a samurai like yourself to speak in our modern language?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Souma worried %}
……
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Keito v2 %}
Tell me, what year are we in? We’re in the twenty-first century already. Surely you can think scientifically on your own if you’ve taken the mandatory education.

No one would ever believe that God and ghosts exist. At least, society wouldn’t.

If you ever seriously spoke of the supernatural, people would laugh it off as a joke.

That’s what we’ll be doing — Make everyone laugh off Shinkai Kanata of the Five Eccentrics, the scoundrel claiming to be God.

There’s no chance God could ever exist.

We’ll make them believe that the wishes are being granted not through paranormal miracles, but through *us*, the Student Council — and that we used *normal*, realistic methods.

We’ll make them lose faith in Shinkai Kanata. No — we’ll steal that faith for ourselves.

Instead of that made-up “God”, we’ll be the ones to coddle those dependent worshippers from now on.

They’ll yield to us without hesitation. After all, anyone who’s seen a wish being miraculously granted will continue yearning for more.

That’s why such effortless gratification will never disappear from our world.

Having known the delight of such comforts, the faint of heart tend to drown in dependence on them.

That’s what we’ll become to them.

Once we do, Shinkai Kanata—the obsolete God will only be a hindrance. We’ll subdue him and have him disappear. The students only need *us* to believe in and depend on.

We’ll become their new God instead.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Souma worried %}
N-no… To become a God in His stead — It is unforgivable!

You do not understand a thing, Hasumi-dono! A catastrophe will befall us — Shinkai-dono is not worshipped as God simply as a joke!

There is a reason why we have kept the faith going for so long — why we need God to exist!

This is territory humans mustn't interfere with!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Keito v2 %}
I expected you to react that way, you primitive fool… I *just* said that I researched all about the traditions of this land, did I not? I know about everything.

Let me ask you this instead: You’re a highschooler by now; do you *really* still believe in that fairytale?

Did you ask your mommy and daddy to read it to you on nights you couldn’t sleep when you were young?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Souma worried %}
…Say what you will! But I will do whatever I must to stop you from doing *that*!

God is necessary in this world! It is a role of holiness, one that could never be appointed to a mere human!

It is impossible for someone to become a God in His stead, is it not!?

It is precisely *because* Shinkai-dono is our God that wishes were granted! For He has worshippers who serve Him! And you dare insinuate that the Student Council is capable of such feats?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Keito v2 %}
Well, we’ll only make it *look* like we can. Although, I doubt we’ll be carrying that facade for very long… We only need to make the public daydream until we’ve accomplished our revolution.

They’re meek beings clinging onto God, they won’t be of use to us any other way.

The same goes for you. There’s nothing you could do for me, not when you’re just a hollow, lying fraud that can’t think with his own head.

I only need to throw you away now that I’ve made use of you as much as I could.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Souma worried %}
I… Hasumi-dono, for you, I wou—
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Keito v2 %}
What do you think you’re doing? I’ve no interest in keeping useless ornaments in my room.

I have work to discuss here. Children who believe in fairytales should leave the room at once.

From today forth, you’re banished from Akatsuki. You fabricated a false report filled with lies and fraudulence, and betrayed my hopes for you… So it’s only natural to dispose of you, isn’t it?

Kanzaki, don’t you *dare* show your face to me ever again. I’m through with you.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Souma worried %}
—!

…… *<th>(sobs)</th>*
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Keito v2 %}
……

<em>…<th>(exhales)</th>,</em> he’s gone.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kuro past %}
Haha, poor him. He was basically in tears.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Keito v2 %}
…I had to. Boys only grow stronger with every tear they shed.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kuro past %}
Oh? Are you gonna say you’re tryin’ to hone him?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Keito v2 %}
Of course not. This is just my own selfish ego — You could say it’s the same as a parent who insists abuse is a means of discipline.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kuro past %}
Haha, woah. You’re pretty dark, aintcha, daddy-o.[^19]
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Keito v2 %}
Stick to one name already. No, never mind, there won’t be any need to… I don’t mind if this was the last straw for you — You’re free to never show yourself here ever again.

I laughed it off a second ago, but the truth is — the tradition within this land is terrifyingly rooted deep beyond measure.

I honestly can’t predict how the worshippers would react were we to interfere with their faith regarding Shinkai Kanata.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kuro past %}
Is that why you drove out Kanzaki? ‘Cause he’ll be safe from whatever could happen if you make him have no relation to us?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Keito v2 %}
That, too. But in reality, his hands are still clean.

From here onwards… No, from the very moment we began our revolution by defeating Valkyrie, we have entered a reign in which nothing can be settled with kind behavior.

He’s someone who’s earnestly and genuinely trying to become an idol—

I could never bear to have him as an accomplice, when he hasn’t even hurt anyone, nor bears any sin in hand.

Only *I* need to be corrupted. So, Kiryu, you too can—
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kuro past %}
Oh, shut up. I’ve been dyed black throughout my whole body since long back, aight? There ain’t no chance for me to get rid of it. I’ve hurt too many folks at the Dragon King Competition, and other places too, y’know.

There’s no turnin’ back for me.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Keito v2 %}
…I see. That will be a huge help, I won’t deny. I tried to act tough earlier, but I’m aware that I can barely do anything on my own.

I’m still on my way there… No, everything has only just begun.

I need your help in order to make these dreams come true. I’m weak… I couldn’t even push such a pure, adoring child away without hurting him.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kuro past %}
Yeah, yeah, keep your grumblin’ for later. We’re only gonna get busier, Danna.

Let’s start doin’ what we need to do, as quickly as possible. Besides, I already know exactly where I’m headin’ — After all, I’ve left my childhood friend to die, despite my promise to protect him.

I’ve committed sins, so we’re both goin’ straight to hell. Which means it’s just idiotic to waste our time fumblin’ about.

Let’s live and die like fireworks, and get boiled up in the kettle of Hell together.

We’ll rinse our bodies with hot water then — So let’s get to drenchin’ ourselves in blood.

<th>(Everything began to change ever since that day.)</th>

<th>(Actually, it’s more like something lurking under the water's surface had finally shown its true form…)</th>

<th>(There were already a few people who were jealous and frustrated with the Five Eccentrics, since they seemed to be given special privilege for no reason…)</th>

<th>(But they’re at the top of Yumenosaki Academy. Everyone was grovelling at their feet in public, without any complaints.)</th>

<th>(Yet… Ever since Valkyrie suffered that cruel defeat that day—)</th>

<th>(Everyone began to curse at them, as if they were letting loose built-up resentment.)</th>

<th>(Telling them to “get off their high horse”, calling them “eccentrics just posing as geniuses”, saying that they’re “cheaters who bypassed the system”…)</th>

<th>(They began to support the Student Council, who disdained the Five Eccentrics and waged a war against them.)</th>

<th>(It’s almost hard to believe… It’s as if a magic spell was cast on them… They all flipped a switch somehow — They’re letting themselves go along with what their council superiors say.)</th>

<th>(The school’s social media suddenly became used commonly among the students, apparently because it’s practically free and easy to use—)</th>

<th>(And there are a vast amount of accounts who keep linking and spreading the Student Council’s posts, following suit with their exact words.)</th>

<th>(They’re doing nothing but repeating after the Student Council, but the more they make their own comments about it, the more they strongly feel the same way as the Student Council.)</th>

<th>(They brainwash themselves, and make themselves believe that the Student Council’s opinions are their own.)</th>

<th>(They can relax knowing they’re part of the bigger force. Now that they're at a safe place, they make themselves feel better and more important by trampling over what is now the minority—The Five Eccentrics.)</th>

<th>(I know what this is — it’s bullying.)</th>

<th>(It’s the exact same bullying that society has constantly deemed as a social issue.)</th>

<th>(Everyone obviously knows that it’s wrong to bully—)</th>

<th>(And as we’re all boys here, I’m sure they’ve watched tokusatsu shows, and got to learn what is good and bad from heroes—)</th>

<th>(Yet, despite all this, the bullying never stops. Why? Because they don’t think they’re doing anything wrong.)</th>

<th>(They’re doing this under the impression that they’re cheering for the heroes, and together they beat down the bad guys and monsters[^20] that must be loathed.)</th>

<th>(They think it’s fine to crush them — that, by hurling them off into the hemisphere and letting them explode into nothingness, they’re making the world one bit cleaner…)</th>

<th>(They don’t feel guilty about it at all! They just believe themselves to be in the right without a single doubt!)</th>

<th>(I hate it! It’s just vile! Everything my beloved heroes spoke of is being misunderstood and twisted! It’s being used as justification to bully others!)</th>

<th>(…At least, that’s how it feels. I’m not sure anymore.)</th>

<th>(To let bullying happen is the same as joining in that bullying.)</th>

<th>(If I really *was* a hero! I would’ve done what I believe to be righteous, no matter who criticised me!)</th>

<th>(I would choose the correct solution, and reach my hand out to those who need rescuing the most…!)</th>

<th>(But! I can’t do a thing! Because I’m scared! I’m scared to have all that malice turned towards me!)</th>

<th>(Not that I can even do anything, anyway! I can’t save anyone!)</th>

<th>(…This morning, I made eye contact with Shinkai-kun.)</th>

<th>(He was bathing in the fountain again, even though it’s getting so cold now.)</th>

<th>(I still can’t get used to seeing such a bizarre sight, so my eyes laid on him—)</th>

<th>(And he saw me. He looked as if he wanted to say something to me.)</th>

<th>(What did you want to say, Shinkai-kun? “Save me”? Or maybe, “don’t get involved with me”? Just like Mikejima-san kept telling me?)</th>

<th>(Or maybe it was the usual thing? Were you trying to ask me what my wish was?)</th>

<th>(Even though you can’t even grant wishes! You aren’t some God, you’re just a human being!)</th>

<th>(…Lately, I’ve been hearing a rumor — that he can no longer grant any wishes.)</th>

<th>(Apparently, there’s still the Yaobikuni people who tell their wishes to him, but they’re never granted. It’s all over the school social media.)</th>

<th>(That he’s a liar, that he’s a fraud…)</th>

<th>(I think security’s been increased, too, so his worshippers can’t get in school anymore.)</th>

<th>(The scheme that exists to grant those wishes can’t function anymore.)</th>

<th>(The Student Council has been guarding the school grounds, and cracking down on any suspicious people.)</th>

<th>(Actually, no—If the Student Council force is working towards overthrowing the Five Eccentrics…)</th>

<th>(Then they’re probably obstructing Shinkai-kun from granting wishes.)</th>

<th>(Nothing about this was done by magic.)</th>

<th>(That kid isn’t a God. If you ever wanted to, you could do what it takes to stop those “miracles” from happening.)</th>

<th>(It makes me question if they’re really going to go as far as doing that… If they are, then it’s absolutely terrible.)</th>

<th>(That kid — Shinkai-kun has been maintaining his divinity by granting wishes.)</th>

<th>(He never once failed to do so. If he’s truly a God, then he should be almighty… that he would never make a single mistake.)</th>

<th>(And yet, he wasn’t able to grant any wish, over and over.)</th>

<th>(I think whoever is managing the Student Council’s social media account has been exaggerating those failures, and making sure it spreads across the platform.)</th>

<th>(No one will be able to believe that he’s a God anymore… at least not in school.)</th>

<th>(No, no, wait. But the way it’s happening is far too rash and violent. If you get dropped down from the high heavens and plummet straight to the ground, you’d break upon impact and die.)</th>

<th>(Those eyes… Those eyes he had when I saw him. That was him asking me to save him, wasn’t it…?)</th>

<th>(He’s been living his whole life saving people as a God…)</th>

<th>(He’s never once been saved, so maybe he couldn’t ever imagine needing that for himself, and that was why he couldn’t get the words out…?)</th>

<th>(If that's the case, then… what should I do? Do I assume that’s how he feels, and go save him?)</th>

<th>(Would I be satisfied with that? Can I abandon everything just to save someone who isn’t even my friend — someone I just talked to a little in the past…?)</th>

<th>(Can I really become an ally of the person that the entire Student Council has their eyes on?)</th>

Bucho~…?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki mgn %}
…!? W-What is it, Akehoshi? What’s wrong? I’m using this practice room right now, y’know?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Subaru %}
I know. You mentioned that in the club yesterday.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki mgn %}
A-Ahh… I did say that, huh… I’m happy to see you join the club more often lately, Akehoshi.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Subaru %}
I just had the free time, is all. But y’know~ The Venus Cup that happened the other day ended up going really well—

Like, originally, the live show wasn’t going to have any advertisement in any way, but people still heard about it through rumors and sent over job offers to me.

I was so happy about it that I basically accepted every single one of them, so I’m gonna start getting busy soon.

So, yeah… That’s why I wanna practice. Could I do it here with you?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki mgn %}
Mhm… Of course, you’re always welcome.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Subaru %}
Thanks! You saved me a bunch~ The practice rooms aren’t for free, after all.

I’m not gonna get my pay until after I’m done with all the jobs, and I’m already broke just preparing what’s necessary for them~

It’s putting me in a tough spot right now, so I’m glad you were in here. I figured there wouldn’t be any other Ryuseitai members with you, since they’re never motivated.

So I was like, oh, maybe Bucho~ could let me use a corner of his practice room for my own needs.

And I was right~ It’s so spacious here when you’re all alone, huh? I’ll make sure not to get in your way, though—

But yep, I’ll take your offer and practice in this room.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki mgn %}
Mhm, feel free! Oh, but don’t go for the corner! Let’s practice together!

If there’s anything you don’t know, just ask me! I’ll teach you from top to bottom! ♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Subaru %}
Whaa~? I may need help with basketball, but I doubt there’s anything you could teach me when it comes to idol stuff, ‘kay?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki mgn %}
What!? Don’t look down on me, Akehoshi! I study very hard, so both my practical grades and theoretical grades are excellent!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Subaru %}
Ahaha, no matter how good your grades are, it doesn’t have much to do with idol activities, does it?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki mgn %}
True, but… I suppose as the elder here, it shows how I have wisdom learned over time—

Hm? I just noticed this, but aren’t you a little wet? The weather should’ve been good today; did a rainshower happen at some point?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Subaru %}
Ahh… It’s not from the rain. A weird guy got hold of me, see…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki mgn %}
D-Did he throw water at you or something!? That’s so cruel! I’ll go make a complaint!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Subaru %}
Oh, no no! I think he was bathing in the fountain for some reason.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki mgn %}
—!!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Subaru %}
I was doing my usual walk with Daikichi, yeah? Then suddenly, the guy just jumped on me, so I got splashed with water.

I guess I’m this soaked ‘cause he clinged to me.

I tried to wipe it off with a towel, but maybe it didn’t dry off enough…? Sorry, sorry. I’ll wipe the wet floor with a mop or something, okay?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki mgnserious %}
Akehoshi!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Subaru %}
Woah! What!?
{% endbubble %}
{% img /img/es/eventstory/meteorimpact/secondhalfch17_2.jpg %}
{% bubble Chiaki mgnserious %}
That weird person… was Shinkai Kanata-kun, wasn’t it?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Subaru %}
Y-Yeah. Yep, the guy from the Five Eccentrics.

That guy’s had it hard lately, hasn’t he…? The Five Eccentrics people have been getting harsh criticism, so he looked pretty mentally exhausted to me.

He was mumbling something while clinging to me; stuff like, “tell me your wish” and “let me grant your wish”… Honestly, it kinda freaked me out.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki mgnserious %}
……
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Subaru %}
Ah, that’s right! Maybe I misheard, but he mentioned your name at one point, too.

He kept saying “Chiaki”… I don’t think there’s anyone else with that name in this school, right?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki mgnserious %}
Huh? He called my name? Why would he…?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Subaru %}
I dunno. I think Daikichi thought I was getting attacked when he hugged me…

He started barking, so I hurried to pull him and took him back home.

So I dunno why he called for you.

Is he your friend or something?
{% endbubble %}

{% img /img/es/eventstory/meteorimpact/secondhalfch17_3.jpg %}

{% bubble Chiaki mgnsad %}
No… He isn’t. We’ve barely even talked.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Subaru %}
Hmm, I see… But you’re gonna save him, aren’t you?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki mgnserious %}
Wha…?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Subaru %}
You’re a hero, after all. You can’t overlook a person in trouble, right? That’s what you always say.

You’re a hero of justice who crushes the strong and saves the weak, right?

That guy also knows that about you, doesn’t he? That’s why he kept calling your name — he probably wants your help, yeah?

Whatcha gonna do? How are you gonna save him?

It’s probably gonna be super hard to pull off, but… I’m cheering you on! Actually, if there’s anything I can do, tell me! I’ll do the best I can to help!

{% bubble Subaru %}
Heheh. I’m so grateful to have you, Bucho~. I had so many awful days, but I was still able to keep on being an idol.

Whenever it felt too rough or when I was feeling lonely, you’d always call out to me. You saved me a whole bunch just by doing that.

You kept saying stuff like, “I don’t want you to go,” “I want you to stay with me”…

I can stay as an idol as long as someone—even if it’s only one person—wants me to be one. I’ll be able to laugh, sing, and dance.

I dunno why you’re always so nice to me… No, actually, that’s exactly why it made me so happy.

Knowing there was someone who’d be nice to me without any specific reason… I may be exaggerating, but it honestly allowed me to avoid despairing about the world.

So thank you.

I’m so, so grateful, I looove you, Bucho~…♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki mgnserious %}
……
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Subaru %}
A-Ah, yep! Serious talk over! Sorry! I said something weird!

Being in school has been making me feel awful, and it reminded me of the past… so like, it kinda made me a little anxious and unstable, I think!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki mgnserious %}
Akehoshi.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Subaru %}
Hm? What is it…? I’m starting to feel really embarrassed, so just forget what I said!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki mgnserious %}
…Alright. I’ll forget about it.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Subaru %}
…?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki mgnserious %}
What you said to me makes me so happy… I don’t actually want to forget it.

That was the most grateful and most honorable thing I've ever been told in my entire life.

But, I’ll forget about it. So you should forget about it too, please.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Subaru worried %}
U…h? Forget about what?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki mgnserious %}
All those things I said—where I was only pretending to be a hero, talking like some know-it-all.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Subaru serious %}
…………
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki mgnsad %}
I was never a hero. I loved them, I longed to become them— But no matter how hard I try, I will never be able to become one—

I finally realized that. I finally recognized that.
{% endbubble %}

{% img /img/es/eventstory/meteorimpact/secondhalfch18_1.jpg %}

{% bubble Subaru worried %}
What’re you saying, Bucho~…?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki mgnsad %}
Thinking back on everything — it was all just some stupid, childish dream. I never understood a single thing.

Our world isn’t like a tokusatsu show. Every guy in the whole, entire world realizes that early on, but I never did until this very moment.

No… I *should* have realized, but I refused to accept it.

But… I can’t do it anymore.
{% endbubble %}

{% img /img/es/eventstory/meteorimpact/secondhalfch18_2.jpg %}

{% bubble Subaru serious %}
……
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki mgnsad %}
I mean, look at me! I can’t do *anything*! You asked me what I’ll do for him, didn’t you? There isn’t a single thing I would ever be able to do, Akehoshi!

I don’t even have a clue where to start! I bet it would just go to waste even if I did try!

Look at this! This is the toy figurine of the very first hero I admired!

I'd carry him with me all the time, just like a charm! Knowing a hero was here, right by my side, gave me peace of mind!

But! He does absolutely nothing for me! I shouted so many times for help! Deep down, *and* out loud!

But the hero never, ever came to save me!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Subaru serious %}
……
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki mgnsad %}
It hurt so much to be ignored and made fun of by the guys who were supposed to be my comrades! One time, they saw my toy figurine and tore it apart, mocking me the whole time!

It made me feel horrible! But I held it in and laughed it off!

There’s so many of them — I may be working out now, but I’ve always, *always* been weak! I will *never* win against them!

I never had the guts to fight them, either! After all, violence is never the answer! I just thought that if I held on long enough that eventually, the hero would rescue me—

Not that it’s even possible…! And yet, I still believed in it the whole time—No, I *forced* myself to believe in it, just to make myself feel better!

I kept believing that life is only hard right then! That one day, as long as I keep my heart in the right place, I’ll be rewarded for it!

I lived my life that way, just telling myself that, over and over! But I'm over that… I’ve finally realized that’s never going to happen, just like everyone else!

There’s no point in doing anything! I feel bad for Shinkai-kun, I really do! If I could help him, I would! But there’s nothing I can ever do for him!

I’m so sorry! You had hope in me, you believed that I was a hero! But that’s exactly why I just can’t keep lying about this anymore!

You can see it yourself, can’t you!? This is who I am! I can’t protect anyone, and I can’t save anyone! I’m not a hero!

I don’t deserve your respect…!

Ahh, jeez… That ruined my mood.

Sorry, I’ll just go home for today. I just remembered I didn’t feed Daikichi, so I’m sure he’s whining for me.
{% endbubble %}
{% img /img/es/eventstory/meteorimpact/secondhalfch18_4.jpg %}
{% bubble Subaru angry %}
I did something bad, I guess… But oh well, no matter what kinda bad thing I do, a hero won’t come and punish me for it, right?

I know that already. Of *course* I was aware of that.

But it’s not like I wanted to be reminded about that fact.
{% endbubble %}

*Sigh*… In the end, you’re no different from everyone else, huh…

You’re all talk but nothing else… Saying that you’re doing it for love, for dreams, for justice… But once the time comes, you just look the other way instead of seeing all the foul, terrifying stuff out there in the world.

If some higher-up—If everyone starts saying, “*they’re* the bad guy,” you’ll just believe it’s true.

Not objecting to it, not sticking up for them, not saving them… just means you’re the same as *those* guys, doesn’t it?

You’re the same kind of person as the people who killed my dad.

I-I’m sor— It isn’t like th— No. It's as you say.

I’m so sorry, Akehoshi.

Nah, you don’t have to apologize.

But I'm super annoyed, so let me just say this.

There! C’mon! Hang in there! Don’t give up on living, Shinkai-kun!

Reality may be full of painful stuff, but still!

There’s things worth living for! Actually—I’ll even work hard so that you can believe that!

So please live, Shinkai-kun! That’s the only wish I’ll ever give you…!
{% endbubble %}

wish—

…yes. fufu, you finally told me your Wish.

i’ve been waiting for so long, chiaki…♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki mgnworried %}
Ahh! You came back to life! I’m so glaaad…! Uaaah, I’m so, *so* glad you’re safe…! ☆ *<th>(sobs)</th>*
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata pastsmile %}
fufu. what’s wrong, are you crying? or are you Imitating a Sea turtle, chiaki…?

did something Sad happen? should I give you a “good boy, good boy”? would that make you stop Crying?
{% endbubble %}
{% img /img/es/eventstory/meteorimpact/secondhalfch20_1.jpg %}
{% bubble Chiaki mgnworried %}
Uuu~? N-No, you’re mistaken! I’m not crying! That’s just water in my eyes!

Actually— A hero only sheds happy tears, so that’s the kind of tears I’ve been shedding, okay…!?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata pastsmile %}
i see! i understand now! so a hero does not cry, yes…?

fufu, i am jealous. you were able to become a hero…♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki mgnworried %}
Ah, no! That was just a figure of speech, I have a habit of thinking out loud, see…!?

Ahh, what am I saying! Point is, I don't have the qualifications to call myself a hero!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata pastsmile %}
is that so? those “qualifications” are a necessity, i see~ is it some kind of Job?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki mgnworried %}
No, it isn’t a job, it’s a way of lif—… Ahhh, seriously, what am I on about?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata pastsmile %}
fufu… please calm down, it will be okay.

thanks to you… i am saved.

but… you really are Mean, chiaki… who was it that granted your Wish?

you became a hero at some point, didn’t you?

even though i have become less of a God at some point…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki mgnserious %}
……
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata pastcurious %}
i *am* a god, right? i am supposed to be, but everyone tells me it is not true. why is that?

it seems like i have become a liar and a fraud.

that is what everyone says. is that true?

please tell me, chiaki, like when we first met—

if i am not a god, then what am i…?

i don’t understand… it is Sad not to understand. no matter who i Ask, no one gives me an Answer. but, if it is you, chiaki…

you, who i granted no Wish for, and Gave nothing… you, who always Gave me things.

you would teach me, wouldn’t you? that is what i had thought, so i had been searching for you forever.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki mgnserious %}
……
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata pastfrown %}
but. i could not meet with you, and it was very— what was it… i think i felt “lonely”.

i do not understand what Lonely means yet…

that is why i wanted to Ask you about that, as well. what is “lonely”? what do i do to make it disappear? won’t you tell me?

or could it be that, now that i am no longer a god, you will not Give me anything?

do i no longer have any Right to receive a Tribute from you?

that… is really Lonely.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki mgnserious %}
—!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata pastfrown %}
wah! w-why are you Hugging me? you will get wet~ you Don’t like that, right?

to you people, that is an Unpleasant feeling, right?

me too. i am not Good at these things… you do not have Body contact like this within the Ocean.

my Scales will fully peel off. that is why… um, chiaki? are you listening?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki mgnserious %}
…Yeah. I’m sorry for suddenly hugging you.
{% endbubble %}
{% img /img/es/eventstory/meteorimpact/secondhalfch20_2.jpg %}
{% bubble Kanata pastfrown %}
no… i feel Warm now. it feels like the “lonely” is slowly Disappearing.

i am not Good with hot things, but this does not feel Bad.

it Hurts a little, and i am not used to it… and it does feel a little strange. i-it is almost frightening.

it’s so hot, i feel like i could melt…

{% bubble Kanata pastfrown %}
chiaki~…?

um. it is really distressing. you are putting Too much pressure — it is Painful.

the Land really is painful to Live on, isn’t it…?

such feelings don’t exist within the Ocean…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki mgnserious %}
No… The ocean would be much more agonizing. Humans can’t breathe underwater.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata pastfrown %}
yes, so it seems. i didn’t know that, because my household is within the Ocean, and i had not once thought of it as Agonizing.

perhaps they added Air inside the Rooms…

that must be it… i was within the Water, yet never got Wet.

oh gosh, couldn’t someone have at least told me that?

i had thought i was a Fishie, and that it was why i could breathe Underwater, too.

but, it seems difficult. i seem to be a fishie who can’t swim.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki mgnserious %}
You aren’t a fish, y’know… and you aren’t a God, either.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata pastfrown %}
…i *am* a god, though.

after all, if there is no god, everyone will be in distress… i have to be a god, or else.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki mgnserious %}
W-What do you mean? I mean, it’s true that the worshippers who serve you as their Living God would be in trouble without you, but otherwise…?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata pastfrown %}
no. without a god, the whole World will be in Distress.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki mgnserious %}
…?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata pastsmile %}
looong ago… a Meteorite fell down on this Land.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki mgnworried %}
Meteorite…? What’re you going on about suddenly, Shinkai-kun!?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata pastsmile %}
the story about God, chiaki. i had Overheard it during Ceremonies, so i don’t know the Full story, but…

looong ago, a Meteorite crashed down. in that meteorite there were many evil, sinful things—

that was how many Human beings became ill… and died.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki mgnserious %}
<th>(Hmmm? So what he means is that there was a legend like that? That people died from illnesses through evil things coming out of a meteorite?)</th>

<th>(It must’ve been a disease of some sort… and then, it began to spread across the land…?)</th>
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata pastsmile %}
it is also said that it was a Curse from the Beings slumbering underground.

the Land broke into pieces because of the Meteorite, and so flowed out the Curses from underground.

the evil, or perhaps the curses, mixed with the Water… and spread across this Land.

a higher up of Long past found that Terrifying—

so he Sacrificed those who did not fall ill, despite being on this Land… and tried to Fix everything that was happening.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki mgnserious %}
Sacrifice… That must be about human sacrifice, huh… Legends like that are all over this world.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata pastsmile %}
hm~ i think it is a little different from Human sacrifice. that would be sacrificing the Victims to the Ocean, right?

they *had* tried that at one point, but it did not seem to Work, and it had actually made the Curse even worse…

so everyone tried a different Method.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki mgnserious %}
Different… method…?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata pastsmile %}
yes. first, they tore the Sacrifice to pieces.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki mgnworried %}
Tore to pieces—!?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata pastsmile %}
they chopped them up, and made them into a feast—and everyone Ate a piece of it, tasty as they were. both their meat, and their blood…

it really is just like the Yaobikuni, isn’t it?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki mgnworried %}
A…te…!? No, that’s too cruel!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata pastsmile %}
is it? but fish are Food, aren’t they?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki mgnworried %}
They aren’t fish… Weren’t the sacrifices human beings?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata pastsmile %}
yes. but once they became Sacrifices, they were no longer Humans.

they become Fish—beings made to be Eaten.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki mgnworried %}
……
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata pastsmile %}
they ate the Sacrifice… and apparently, with that, their illness was Cured.

it Worked perfectly. and so, the Curse disappeared.

a happy ending.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki mgnserious %}
<th>(…It’s probably just a fairytale, but…)</th>

<th>(If I try really hard to interpret this story rationally— Let’s say, you didn’t become infected by the disease thanks to a skilled doctor…)</th>

<th>(This means that they must have dismembered people immune to that disease, turned them into medicine, and gave it to their patients… I guess?)</th>

<th>(This would explain how they managed to cure the disease, without the use of some mysterious magic and whatnot… probably. Either way, it's inhumane.)</th>
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata pastsmile %}
but. after that Happy ending, the chieftain thought to themself: this illness might Come about again.

so, the family members of the sacrifices that never became ill were protected as Gods who rid of the curse — in other words, grant miracles.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki mgnserious %}
Are those… your ancestors?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata pastcurious %}
maybe so.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki mgnserious %}
<th>(Which means, this absurd fairytale-like legend is true…)</th>

<th>(They’re a family that has been turned into Gods and guarded all the way up to the twenty-first century?)</th>
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata pastsmile %}
to be more Precise, apparently, the very first human being who was sacrificed to the Ocean returned all of a Sudden—

at that point, they had been dyed in Evil, and had turned into a Monster…

the person who was turned into a God married them, and gave birth to Children.

they are my ancestors.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki mgnserious %}
<th>(That part… just sounds like a legend, yeah.)</th>

<th>(There’s no way a human being could survive after being submerged into the ocean — They must have made up that story to give the whole “God” thing more weight.)</th>
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata pastsmile %}
the person who was dyed with Evil is my ancestor, and that is why we are capable of performing miraculous deeds.

for example, there was once a Generation of a Chieftain that did not believe in the Legend.

they tried to Persecute us—only to become ill and die.

not only Them, but their family, and many other people of that Land died—is what i heard.

and the illness was finally cured, too… how Sad…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki mgnserious %}
……
{% endbubble %}

## Chapter 22
{% img /img/es/eventstory/meteorimpact/secondhalfch22.jpg %}

{% bubble Kanata pastsmile %}
they learnt their Lesson, and the Chieftain after them begged for our forgiveness—

then they Promised to protect us properly Forever.

with that, everyone’s illness was cured.

i’m sure the chieftains of this Land still believe in that.

the warning and the tale is passed on from Parent to child to this very Day.

…but it is an Ancient story, so there are Many people who have forgotten all about it, it seems.

as many years passed, blood from the outside became mingled with ours… and slowly, things have been changing for us.

we must be much Weaker to our ancestors by now.

that must be why… no one believes that i am a god.

i am sorry.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki mgnserious %}
…Huh? W-Why are you apologizing? I won’t call you a lying fraud, y’know? I mean, you were just raised to think of yourself as a God, right?

Which means you aren’t the one to blame!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata pastfrown %}
…? no… i am apologizing for being Inexperienced as a god, and for growing weaker…

if i was a god, i would have been able to grant any Wish, right?

but, it seems too difficult for me… that is why everyone is Disappointed in me, right?

that is why they’re all fed up with me, and calling me a Liar, right?

i am sorry for being weak… i am sorry for being a failure as a god.

…i’m Terrified, chiaki.

if a Meteorite comes crashing down again… and people become ill, i may not be able to Cure them.

the chance of me failing is very high. after all, i could not cure the rogue’s—mikejima’s Sister.

that is why he is Angry at me, right? that is why he has been Mean to me, right?

we were so Close in the past, but now, because i’m an Inexperienced god…!

he was the only one—the only one who would come to my Room where i had always been Alone… and secretly bring Magazines with him from the Outside world…

even when no one Ordered him to, he would play with me, too…

he Taught me many things i didn’t know, just like you… i loved all of it, so much…

but i am weak as a god, so he started to Hate me, didn’t he?

that is why he stopped coming to see me, right…?

and you, too! chiaki, you’re the Same, aren’t you? i wanted to see you, i was so lonely… but you all left for somewhere Far away!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki mgnserious %}
No… No, you’re wrong, Shinkai-kun.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata pastcurious %}
…?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki mgnserious %}
Mikejima-san was trying to save you from your circumstances. But then the worshippers found out and shunned him, and forced him to keep a distance from you… I think.

You said that he brought over magazines, so maybe actions like that were seen as a problem, too.

I think you were talking about when you were kids, right…? Mikejima-san may be strong and a genius, but he isn’t a God.

He must’ve made mistakes since he was still so inexperienced, and then those piled up until his position was in danger.

That’s what I think. Mikejima-san really *was* a hero… I don’t know how society would view it, but he was one—at least to you.

No, actually—Maybe this is just me imagining things, but I think he wanted to become a hero after seeing them on TV, just like I did.

Then, naturally, from devoting so much time learning from heroes… he tried to save you.

That’s why he was part of Ryuseitai. He was just like me… I think.

But he couldn’t accomplish it, so he failed… He was completely defeated by something far too large and vile…

<th>(Well, of course… He hasn’t asked me to save him, so normally I wouldn’t need to try to fight, but…)</th>

<th>(I know the whole truth now.)</th>

<th>(And I’m sure there isn’t a single qualification required to become a God *or* a hero.)</th>[^21]

<th>(He’s exactly the same as I was — when I was young, all alone, coughing in my hospital bed—when I knew nothing, not even why I was suffering…)</th>

{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata pastcurious %}
—is that your Wish?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki mgnworried %}
Mm!? Did I say it out loud!?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata past %}
no… for some reason, i could just Tell. a*hem*\~ this must be because I am a god~♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki mgnserious %}
No, it’s because you’re human — the same as me. You can feel empathy and understand how someone feels.

A God would probably have no interest in us, even if there really is one in this world.

No matter how much we beg to be rescued, it would never bring about a miracle.

If that’s what God is… then, even if it does truly exist, everything is practically the same as it’d be without its existence.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata pastfrown %}
whaa~? i am *different*! i would Save you if you tell me your wish! i would bring about Miracles, and grant wishes!

that is what i have been doing all my life! that is why i am a god!

if you have any Complaints, then i shall Prove it to you! chiaki, make any sort of wish right now!

i will use all my Power to grant it!

your Wish is to become a hero… yes?

i figured that’s what you were Thinking about a second ago! because i am a god!

i will grant you that wish! right this instant!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki mgn %}
No… You don’t need to.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata pastfrown %}
…whaaaat!?

huh? why!? I don’t understand! please don't Hold back, please let me grant your wish!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki mgn %}
I refuse!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata pastfrown %}
…huh? what? why? you are only Human, yet you oppose me? i’m a god, you know? you must listen to what i say!
{% endbubble %}
{% img /img/es/eventstory/meteorimpact/secondhalfch22_2.jpg %}
{% bubble Chiaki mgn %}
Never!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata pastfrown %}
…w-why…? uuu, why don’t you want me to grant your wish? i don’t understaaand~!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki mgn %}
Mhm, alright! Allow me to explain! Becoming a hero is not my wish — it’s my *dream*!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata pastfrown %}
d-dream? what is that…? is it different from wishes?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki mgn %}
That’s right! Listen, Shinkai-kun — You can’t make dreams come true through someone else! You have to work hard and make it come true yourself, or else there’s no point to it!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata pastfrown %}
umm… ummm…?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki mgn %}
And! There’s no point in granting your parents’ or ancestors’ dreams in their stead! Well, if your dream is the same as theirs, *then* it’d be fine!

But! Making it come true on your own is what makes a dream so sacred!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata pastfrown %}
i-is that how it is? it is difficult to understand, but i suppose there are things like that, too…?
{% endbubble %}

## Chapter 23
{% img /img/es/eventstory/meteorimpact/secondhalfch23.jpg %}

{% bubble Chiaki mgn %}
Mhm! You’re always asking me questions, so it’s about time I asked you one! Shinkai-kun, what is your dream?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata pastfrown %}
u-um…? i-i don’t know how to respond to such a sudden question…?

ah! i see! your wish is for me to answer that question, yes?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki mgn %}
If that’s what you want to think, then sure! Does that mean granting wishes is your dream?

Fuhaha! We’re just going back and forth with everything right now, huh!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata pastfrown %}
ummm…? i grant wishes because i am a god. i do not know if that is what you would call a Dream or not…!

it is the same as Breathing and eating Food for me… can i call that my Dream?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki mgn %}
That’s different! Well, it is possible to have meals as a dream if you were a kid who was starving to death!

But you aren’t like that, right?

A dream! Is something you don’t have with you at this very moment! But you’ll do whatever it takes to have it within your grasp!

It’ll make you feel like you could work as hard as you possibly can without a second thought, just for the sake of the dream!

Do you not have anything like that, Shinkai-kun?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata pastfrown %}
uhh, umm…? i’m sorry, i am still Thinking!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki mgn %}
Hm. It just occured to me, but isn’t your dream to become an idol?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata pastfrown %}
huh? is that so? why did you Think that, chiaki?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki mgn %}
Well, you’re wearing the same uniform as me!

You’re in Yumenosaki's idol course, aren’t you? Isn’t that because you want to become an idol?

There's no way anyone out there would accidentally join the idol course, after all.

Why did you join the idol course? Or is this also because your peculiar household ordered you to…?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata pastfrown %}
no… i was not given any Order to do so. i am a god, you know?

the likes of mere Humans could never Order me around.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki mgn %}
So we’re just mere humans…?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata pastsmile %}
ah! i am not making a Fool out of you, okay? it is just that Gods and Humans are different, we are Different existences…!

but… the Idols in the magazines and movies mikejima Showed me… i felt like they were similar to me.

i didn’t really understand what they were doing, but… it seemed as though they made everyone smile… and everyone wanted to see them more and more…

so, i thought they were Granting wishes. just like me.

i thought that they must be Gods, too! there were others like me! i was so happy! because i was always, always so lonely…!

if there are other gods, they would only Be a hindrance to my Work, but! i still wanted to meet them…!

that is why! i said that i wanted to become an Idol! that was when i was recommended to go to this school!

i took the Exam as i was asked, too! mikejima helped me with my Studies, so it was very Easy!

he had always been so Far away… but he came Closer to me again after so long, and that made me happy…

he even joined the School with Me.

but… this School was not at all what i Expected. there is not a single god around me…

it only has pitiful Human beings! and mikejima kept going someplace Far away, too!

of course, once i got to meet the Five Eccentrics, they did make that Desire come true, because they are the Same as me.

that was why we were to become Friends.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki mgn %}
Heheh. Then your dream came true.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata pastcurious %}
i wonder… i’m not sure — was that really my Dream?

but in reality, someone started calling us the Five Eccentrics… and it is Thanks to that that i made Friends.

which means someone Granted it for me, so it is not a Dream, yes?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki mgn %}
No, no. As long as it wasn’t completely given to you in its entirety from someone else, then you can still call it a dream.

After all, you worked hard to become their friend, right?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata pastsmile %}
yes… especially shu — he was unwilling to become my Friend.

whenever i would call him my friend, he would Shout in his usual tone, *“non!”…*

so i did my very best. i Talked to him a lot, and learned what his Likes and Dislikes were…

i learned to be careful with what to say, and worked hard to make him Like me.

i Failed many times along the way, but… at some point, he began to call me his Friend.

it made me so happy… ufufu, it makes me Smile just remembering it.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki mgn %}
I see! Then that really must’ve been your dream. It’s because you made it come true on your own that it made you so happy.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata pastfrown %}
mm~? i don’t understand this anymore! i really can’t help but see Wishes and Dreams as the same! i cannot tell the Difference!

it is Not a dream if all of it is Bestowed on you by someone, right? then, i will make a Compromise with you!

chiaki! please tell me your Wish!

and once you’ve Worked hard for a bit, i will make it possible to Grant it!

…is that wrong, too?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki mgn %}
No, not at all. I really appreciate it. I’m happy to hear that you want to support and help me achieve my dream.

But please, don’t use your worshippers just to help me with my dream!

If you’ll help me by yourself — if you’ll lend me a hand ordinarily, then I don’t mind!

That’s how all the people in the whole world make their dreams come true, without ever using the help of some God!

I can’t cheat my way toward it! So please, cheer me on as a friend!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata pastcurious %}
friend… chiaki, you will become my Friend?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki mgn %}
Hm? Yep, only if that’s alright with you! If you ever feel lonely, call for me! I’ll hug you!

Let’s do lots of fun things together! Let’s become friends!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata pastcurious %}
…but. chiaki, you are not a god, are you?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki mgn %}
I’m not, and neither are you. I’ll sound a little mean with how I word this, but — if you want to be my friend…

Then you have to become a human being that lives on the same surface as me, instead of a God who sits at the top of the heavens.

If it’s just you as a human being, then you’re always welcome to be my friend! Let’s become close friends that laugh, cry, and enjoy their youth together!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata pastfrown %}
mm~ gods are not up in the Heavens, but Deep within the oceans, though…

well, i will think it through.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki mgn %}
Okay! Tell me when you've decided! I pray that we really do become friends at some point and shake each other’s hands! ☆
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata past %}
ah! did you just say “Pray”? i see, so that is your Wish…☆
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki mgn %}
Ooh!? But that’s only a figure of speech! Making friends isn’t my wish *nor* my dream! My dream is—
{% endbubble %}
## Chapter 24
{% img /img/es/eventstory/meteorimpact/secondhalfch24.jpg %}

{% bubble Madara hidden %}
“Your dream is to become a hero… riiight?”
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki mgn %}
—!?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata past %}
huh? was that mikejima’s Voice just now? or was it my imagination?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Madara hidden %}
“Hahaha! My oh my, don’t be so surprised! It’s not just your imagination, it’s your Mamaaaaaaa!! ☆”

“How absolutely joyous! You’ve been calling me a rogue for a while, but now you’re calling me by my name again!? I’m sooo happy, Kanata-san!

“You remembered my name!”

“That’s right! You had never needed to want *‘that’*, y’know—for you see, your friend has been here from the very staaaart!!”
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata pastfrown %}
u-ummm? where? show Yourself, manservant!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Madara hidden %}
“I’m not a manservant! I’m repeating myself, but—I’m your friend! Or, really, I’m your Mamaaaaa!”

“Wait—But we’ll be family if I become your Mama, so wouldn’t that mean we won’t be friends? I’m contradicting myself!”
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki mgn %}
Ahhh! Look over there, Shinkai-kun! There’s something rising up from the ocean! It looks huge… Wait—Is it a monster!?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Madara hidden %}
“Nah, it’s not! It’s a drone that I dropped in the ocean to make it look like a meteorite.”

“Mama made eeevery single part of it all by himself! My recipe is a secret! It’s waterproof, and to some extent, I can control it remotely from far away!”
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki mgn %}
Drone…? Ahh, it’s true! It does look like some kind of machine…? I-Is it safe to get close to it? It won’t explode, right!?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Madara hidden %}
“Don’t worry, don’t worry, it won’t. Probably. Don’t be so alarmed, please come closer… You guys are a liiittle too far away for me to see you clearly.”

“I do have a camera set up inside the drone, but—”

“In the end, people understand each other’s intentions better when they talk face to face, right?”
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki mgn %}
Mmm… I don’t really get it, but how about we try going closer, Shinkai-kun?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata pastfrown %}
*sigh*…

wa—ahhh—?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki mgn %}
Are you alright!? You’re staggering a little… It’s hard to walk on sand — You can grab onto my shoulder if you like!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata past %}
okaaay. thank you, chiaki.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki mgn %}
Oh no, no need for thanks! When one of us is in trouble, we all are! You need no reason nor reward to help a friend! Fuhahahaha!! ☆
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata pastfrown %}
acting so high and mighty for something as Simple as this… also, we are not Friends yet, okay?

…you, too. when did *you* ever become my Friend, *rogue*?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Madara hidden %}
“Hahaha… I was *always* trying to be that for you, though…?”

“You’re so strict towards me and only me, Kanata-san… Now that you've finally started thinking for yourself, are you going through your rebellious phase?”

“Well, no matter! Actually, it does matter, but! We don’t have much time, so I’ll cut things short!”

“First off, thank you two for answering my calls!”
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki mgn %}
Hm? It is true that you led me here through a call, but does that mean you called Shinkai-kun over too, too…?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata pastfrown %}
no… for some reason, i am told to never Come into contact with mikejima, so…

it has been a While since i Heard from him, or even his voice.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Madara hidden %}
“Yep! I’m so sorry for making you feel lonely, Kanata-san!”

“Ahhh, I wanna hug you sooo bad! I’ll at least blow kisses at you so a little bit of my love reaches you! Kiss, kiss~☆”
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata pastfrown %}
just die.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki mgn %}
Hm. So, Mikejima-san? Your… real self… is still overseas?

I can see you through the screen attached to the drone, but where is that place…? A warehouse…?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Madara hidden %}
“Yep! I’m using a network to call you guys! I’m in Rio de Janeiro right now!”

“Hahaha! ‘Ri-o-de-Ja-ne-i-ro’ sounds like a Japanese word that comes from an alternate universe!”
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki mgn %}
Why are you in a place like that…? You really are flying all over the world, huh…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Madara hidden %}
“Yep. In fact, even I started to find it weird how much travelling I’ve had to do, so I did some proper research…”

“It seems like Rei-san is in the same boat as me—We’ve been made to travel far away from Japan, with aaall the strings the Tenshouin Zaibatsu have been pulling.”

“…I should’ve noticed how unnatural this was much earlier. There’s no way a religious group native only to its land could have so many connections overseas.”

“But I guess I was in the wrong, too—I think I must’ve felt like Kanata-san’s family was far too large…”

“I’ve known them from a young age, after all… so I must’ve subconsciously thought to myself that together, they’re an invincible entity.”

“I got scared and overestimated their power… So pathetic—even though I’ve grown so tall, and became so strong by now…”

“If I had just taken it seriously and challenged them without hesitation, maybe I could’ve made everything turn out differently.”

“I’m so sorry, Kanata-san… I couldn’t become your hero.”
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata past %}
……
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki mgnserious %}
……
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Madara hidden %}
“But whatever, I’ll keep my whining for later. I’ll look back on everything when I can’t move a single part of my body anymore… There’s no use crying over spilled milk.”

“At least for now, I’ll do whatever I can, so the same failure doesn’t happen again.”

“I won’t hesitate this time around. I’m gonna do whatever it takes to achieve my goal.”

“Kanata-san. You seem worried about it, so I’ll at least tell you this: It’s pretty obvious by now, but—what crashed down into this ocean wasn’t a meteorite.”
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki mgnserious %}
<th>(Meteorite… Ahh, right, his family began from one.)</th>

<th>(That must be why they’ve set up a specific method to be able to sense quickly if a meteorite is about to crash down on this land.)</th>

<th>(It’s the origin of the religious faith regarding his family… They can’t ignore the meteorite.)</th>

<th>(If by any chance it happens… In other words, if the meteorite brings with it the evil it did long ago, they can easily make contact with God.)</th>

<th>(Not that I think it would help anything if Shinkai-kun comes over to their rescue…)</th>

<th>(But trying to make logical sense out of “religious reasoning” is practically impossible.)</th>

<th>(However, if you can make sense out of it, you could use it to your advantage. And Mikejima-san did just that—)</th>

<th>(He controlled the drone and made it crash into the ocean, like a meteorite… and that’s how he lured Shinkai-kun out.)</th>

<th>(The worshippers forbid him from contacting Shinkai-kun, so he had to find another way to talk to him.)</th>
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata past %}
…hm. i see. why did you do this then?

a Meteorite is no Joke to us, you know?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Madara hidden %}
“Hahaha! Within Ryuseitai is a meteor![^22] So I made a hoax about a meteorite crashing down from the sky and straaaight onto the earth…♪”
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata pastfrown %}
<em>…<th>(glares)</th></em>
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Madara hidden %}
“…That’s not the real reason, of course. I’ll stop cracking jokes, so please stop trying to break the camera, Kanata-san!”

“I’m done joking around now, really!”
{% endbubble %}
## Chapter 25
{% img /img/es/eventstory/meteorimpact/secondhalfch25.jpg %}

{% bubble Madara hidden %}
“Chiaki-san.”
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki mgn %}
Y-Yes? D-Did I do something!?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Madara hidden %}
“Why’re you acting so surprised… You’re as timid as always—although that has its own cute charm to it.”

“I called you ‘cause I have a favor to ask of you, of course.”
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki mgn %}
Me…?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Madara hidden %}
“Yep. Chiaki-san, I’ll make you into a hero.”

“There’s a ship coming over to you guys soon.”

“In it, there are Kanata-san’s worshippers, but among them is someone I took as much time as necessary to train in order to become a spy.”

“I want you to cooperate with that person, and take Kanata-san to his home, where it’s safe.”
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata past %}
my… house?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Madara hidden %}
“Yep. You’re in the center of this whirlpool, so it'll probably be hard for you to understand why… but I’m sure Chiaki-san will.”

“Kanata-san is in a very unfavorable position in Yumenosaki right now.”

“He was chosen as the second Eccentric to be subjugated… and they’re trying to publicly execute him through the live show that’s about to start.”
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki mgn %}
…You know a lot even when you’re overseas, huh?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Madara hidden %}
“Hahaha, nooobody holds their tongue in this day and age! If I ever wanna know something, there’s plenty of ways to get the info.”

“Like logging into the school’s social media through a student’s account who I blackmailed…”

“It seems like Rei-san and I—and anyone else who’s overseas—are denied access to social media.”

“Well, Rei-san just doesn’t like using electronics, but *I* personally can find aaall kinds of loopholes in the internet.”

“On the other hand, Kanata-san’s family hasn’t kept up with the modern times, so I can’t figure out what they’ve been up to through the internet alone…”

“But, whatever — never mind that for now.”

“The Student Council folks are completely serious about making this war happen. They’re gonna do whatever it takes to crush Kanata-san—the one appointed as the antagonist, and the evil.”

“I dunno how it is in school right now, but by reading the school’s social media… I don’t see any place that he could belong within school.”

“Being in that place will only get you minced up, like your ancestors from long ago that were made into sacrifices.”
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata pastfrown %}
……
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Madara hidden %}
“And with that, Yumenosaki will be revolutionized, and we begin a beaaautiful, peaceful new era! Yep, yep! You need sacrifices to accomplish that, don’t you~♪”

“…It’s absolute bullshit.”
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki mgn %}
I think so, too. I see, so that’s what this was about…

I thought a tale of good and evil was happening, but I see now… it was all a scheme planned by the Student Council…

I’ve been believing in and cheering on people like that…?

I was under the belief that they would change this world for us…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Madara hidden %}
“The world will probably change, yeah. But, for that change to happen, there are people being turned into sacrifices.”

“There are people who have been shedding tears on the other side of history… and the one who saves those people is the hero, right?”

“You may think differently, Chiaki-san, but that’s how I see it.”

“I honestly don’t care for justice from a ‘fair’ standpoint. Even if they’d been turned into evil within society, I *will* be the ally of those precious to me.”

“I don’t care if I’m called a villain for it.”
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki mgn %}
…I think you’re a wonderful hero, Mikejima-san.

That’s exactly why you’re also dressed *that* way, right?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Madara hidden %}
“Hm? No, no! I needed this uniform for work, that’s aaall!”

“I figured no one would use it, so I stole it from the AV room, since that’s become Ryuseitai’s storage area!”
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki mgn %}
You should get permission first… I suppose you can’t choose your methods for your goals, but… you should do the proper procedures no matter what.

If you just keep doing what you like, you’ll lose all your allies.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Madara hidden %}
“I’m fine with me being my only ally. Besides, no one would be upset if I took it, would they? I mean, I chose the color that barely makes an appearance in Super Sentai shows, y’know?”

“There were a bunch of other uniforms in red, blue, and other common colors, sooo… Chiaki-san, feel free to use any of them if you need to.”
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki mgn %}
Really…? Then I’d like to wear the red uniform. Though it probably doesn’t suit me with how I am right now.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata past %}
…? i do not quite understand, but i would like blue~♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki mgn %}
Ahaha, you aren’t part of Ryuseitai, y’know~… Ah, but wait? Hmm? It *would* suit you, though…?

<th>(Huh, wait… I think I have a great idea.)</th>
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata past %}
Um? err… so, i should go Back home, yes?

it is true that the School is suffocating right now, so… i would like to go home.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Madara hidden %}
“Mhm. You don’t need to become a sacrifice. Just hide somewhere safe.”

“And then, once things calm down, and you still feel like being an idol, I’d like you to come over to my place. No—I’ll come pick you up from your house, and we could go there together.”
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata past %}
mikejima’s… place? is that Outside the Ocean…?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Madara hidden %}
“Yep. See, there’s an acquaintance I know here, and apparently they’re gonna make a whole new agency.”

“A young, new idol agency, that is controlled by neither Yumenosaki, nor the rumored CosPro…”

“We’ll have a re-do with our time as idols in that agency. We’ll even get to have our whooole youth there.”
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata pastfrown %}
…that…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Madara hidden %}
“Does the thought make you uneasy? I figured… It’s not like you can trust anything I say at this point…”

“And anyway, truthfully, I don’t even know if they’re gonna manage establishing it or not.”

“I may be trusting that acquaintance, but there’s still a chance they could reject us from the agency. If that happens, we’ll have nowhere left to run.”
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata pastfrown %}
…the fact that i Was one of the five Eccentrics… will become a Problem, won’t it…

to Idols, we are the Absolute worst… we are Infamous for being Evil, aren’t we…?

no agency’s Manager would ever accept such an idol…
{% endbubble %}

## Chapter 26
{% img /img/es/eventstory/meteorimpact/secondhalfch26.jpg %}

{% bubble Madara hidden %}
“…I’m gonna do something about that.”
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata pastfrown %}
no. that itself would be a Problem.

you are not one of the five Eccentrics… you are not the least bit Tainted… you are still Clean.

i can understand that now… just by Talking to you a little.

you never changed, did you? you are a Kind person, mikejima.

the mama Role none of the other young Boys ever wanted to do—

you yourself took on that Role when we were playing House, for my sake.

and then, while everyone Feared me as their god… *you* Taught me about many things, when i knew nothing.

that is the type of person you are… so i cannot Burden you any more than this.

it is your Dream to become an idol, isn’t it?

it would only be Sad if you were turned into a Villain along with Me and lost your dream, all because of me… wouldn’t it?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Madara hidden %}
“…Nah. I was never interested in idols—I just joined Yumenosaki to take care of you, the Living God, y’know?”

“So! It’s peeerfectly fine if I fail to become an idol! ‘Cause I never had any interest in becoming one, anyway!”
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata pastfrown %}
…liar.

if that is the case. then why were There idols in the Magazines you would always bring over…?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Madara hidden %}
“……”
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata pastsmile %}
mikejima. thank you for trying to Protect me until the very end.

no matter what anyone says, *i* at least will never call you evil or a monster.

you are my hero…… but, enough of all of this.

i will quit being an idol.

apparently, idols and gods are different from each other, but… if no one is in Need for me, then i may as well not Exist.

i will go back home, and live as usual there for the rest of my life. i will live within the Depths of the ocean forever.

the dragon king palace’s Banquet is over. it was always such a Strange concept, anyway—*me*, becoming an idol.

i could not even become a proper god, and lost hold of my religious faith…

there was no chance someone like me could ever be capable of becoming Something else.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki mgn %}
…Like a transformation[^23], huh.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata past %}
mm? what is it, chiaki?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki mgn %}
I see now. You were the same as me.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata past %}
what are you on about…? um, it makes you Happy to know we are the Same, yes?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki mgn %}
Yep! Really happy!

Mikejima-san!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Madara hidden %}
“W-What?”

“Wait, uh, this is a little strange… The ship should’ve arrived by now. Don’t you guys see anything above the ocean…?”

“Mmm… It seems like the Student Council’s scheme to make everyone stop having faith in Kanata-san… has had a horrible ripple effect on his worshippers—even worse than the ones within school.”

“Whatever’s happening behind closed doors is getting reeeally out of hand.”

“So there’s a chance the worshipper I trained into a spy switched sides against us, or they may no longer be capable of helping us.”

“But I already came up with a backup plan: ask Chiaki-san to escort you instead. I can trust you, Chiaki-san.”

“If the ship doesn’t come to pick you up, then I apologize for taking up your time, but I’d like you to shelter him in your own home for a while.”

“I was already considering asking you to do that in the case the ship *does* arrive, but everyone in there is in disarray and tries to harm Kanata-san… or even if you just sensed something bad from them.”
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki mgn %}
So that’s why you called for me… I have no means of retaliation if they start attacking us, y’know? I’ll only get beaten down—I’m weak when it comes to fighting, I’m not like my friend.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Madara hidden %}
“No, there’s no need for you to fight. Just call for the police.”

“You’ll be able to talk to my dad if you just mention my family name, and they should bring over support in only a few minutes.”

“I’ve already asked him to be on standby for it. …He’s still my parent, more or less, so he’ll probably do what I asked of him.”
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki mgn %}
But then, why didn’t you just ask your parents to escort Shinkai-kun from the start, instead of me…?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Madara hidden %}
“I can’t trust them thaaat much… Please just know that my parents are always my last resort.”

“Both of them are worshippers themselves, and don’t see me, the problem child, in good light.”
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki mgn %}
I see. You should get along with your family more. Don’t you have things you should be doing before calling yourself a “mama” and playing house?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Madara hidden %}
“That hurts to hear, haha… But anyway, wasn’t there something you were about to say?”
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki mgn %}
Ah, yes. I have one favor to ask, Mikejima-san.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Madara hidden %}
“Sure, let me hear it. Tell me anything, since I owe you big time now.”
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki mgn %}
Thank you! …You see, there’s something I’d like to try.

So I want to postpone the escorting for later—please do forgive me for that.

I’m sure it won’t be too late to give up and run away *after* trying everything you can do first.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Madara hidden %}
“Oooh? Interesting. What is it that you wanna try?”
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki mgn %}
I don’t have enough time to explain. The “Battle versus the Sea God” performance will end if we don’t go there soon.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Madara hidden %}
“Battle versus the Sea God? Isn’t that the live show for executing the ‘Eccentric’, Kanata-san…?”
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki mgn %}
Mhm. I’m thinking of going there right now. …with Shinkai-kun.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata past %}
huh? me too? why? but wait, isn’t a Ship coming…? shouldn’t we Wait for it?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki mgn %}
We aren’t going to go on that ship. Ah, no—maybe if this doesn’t work out, then we should rely on that plan, but— Nah, actually, I already feel like this isn’t going to work, since it’s something *I’m* trying to do.

But! Shinkai-kun, you said it yourself, didn’t you? You said that if no one is in need of you, then you may as well not exist!

But there’s no need to worry! Because I’m here!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata pastcurious %}
whaa…?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki mgn %}
I want to see you as an idol! I want to see the version of you that isn’t a God!

After all, I told you that we should be friends… yet I still know nothing about you!

I want to know more! I want to see more of you, in different ways! Let’s talk about our favorite color! Our favorite food! I’m going to keep saying it — Let’s become friends…!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata pastcurious %}
i-is that your w—
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki mgn %}
No, it isn’t a wish! It’s a promise! I vow on the bright red sunset!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata pastcurious %}
huh..? it is Night time right now, there is no Sunset..?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki mgn %}
Don’t worry about the details! Don’t just give up and act like you've gone cold! Be more passionate—more burned up…!

No! *I’ll* make you passionate! I’ll revive you myself! Not just that—Let’s live on, together! We were finally able to meet each other — I don’t want to say goodbye like this…!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata pastfrown %}
…? …??
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki mgn %}
C’mon, let’s go!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata pastfrown %}
wait, wha—huh? are you serious? where are we going, chiaki~?

please Explain things to me properly! listen to what a god Tells you to do!

## Translation Notes
[^15]: The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zaibatsu" target="_blank">Zaibatsu</a>, which is business conglomerates in Japan.
[^16]: He calls Souma a <em>chuunibyou</em>, because it has the kanji for “illnesss”.
[^17]: Referring to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yama_%28Buddhism%29" target="_blank">Yama</a>.
[^18]: “Mysterious” here is the same word used in Ryusei Blue's catchphrase 神秘(性).
[^19]: Originally <em>oyabun</em> 親分, which can mean a father, and also an (evil) boss.
[^20]: Monsters here is <em>kaijin</em> 怪人, a common word in tokusatsu shows. It refers to an antagonistic humanoid with supernatural abilities. This word will be elaborated in detail in the coming chapters.
[^21]: The chapter title for the second year era is called <em>hero shikkaku</em> ヒーロー失格 in Japanese, literally “Disqualified/unsuitable as a hero”, and can be translated as “failure as a hero” (see: Kanata’s dialogue earlier in the chapter). But due to Chiaki’s epiphany here, I decided the best way to translate the title is to go with “Unqualified Hero”.
[^22]: The <em>ryusei</em> in Ryuseitai means “meteor” (and of course, means “shooting star”).
[^23]: Chiaki uses the same word that tokusatsu heroes say before transforming: <em>henshin</em> (Translated as <em>“Transform!”</em> much earlier in this story, and sometimes in other Enstars stories too.)
