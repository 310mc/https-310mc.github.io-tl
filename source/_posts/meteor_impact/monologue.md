{% bubble Kanata %}
well then\~ i’m off~♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki %}
Mhm! Take care! Be careful on the streets! Call for me if any problems show up!

I’ll come rushing to you in a flash!! Fuhahahaha!! ☆
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora %}
Ahaha… We’re heading straight home, so I don’t think anything *could* happen…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
Eh, I bet he just wanted to say something heroic…

Well, whatever… <th><em>(yawns)</em></th> ♪

I don’t feel right going home when we haven’t even finished cleaning up, but I’m also starting to feel really sleepy, so… I think I’ll take my leave, yeah…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki %}
Mhm! Honestly, I should apologize for making you all stay up so late!

I’ll have to apologize to your parents after this, since I kept their precious son in school so late! I must really be worrying them!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
Uh, no… I doubt mine are worried at all; I told them about this beforehand anyway…

Besides, whenever I’m lazing around at home during nighttime, they just tell me to go hang out with friends…

You wouldn’t expect it, but my brother would always hang out with his friends back when he was in school…

So, since he was so good at pretty much everything, they scold me when I don’t do things the same way… Or maybe it worries them, I guess…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora %}
Ahaha, your brother’s your brother, and you’re you! That’s what I think.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
I know, right… It really annoys me to be compared to my older brother over just about anything… I’m jealous of you for being an only child, Tetora-kun…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora %}
Really? But I’m jealous of you for having siblings, y’know?
{% endbubble %}

{% img /img/es/eventstory/meteorimpact/monologue_1.jpg %}

{% bubble Chiaki %}
Right, right! I know how you feel, Nagumo! Aaalright, you’re free to call me “Onii-chan~♪” from today onwards…!! ☆
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora %}
Gyaaa!? Like I *said*, please stop hugging me at every opportunity~!!

Aren’t you planning to keep on cleaning!? You’ve gotta stop using up your energy already — You’ll collapse, y’know!?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata %}
shh… don’t Make a noise, everyone. shinobu will wake up.
{% endbubble %}

{% img /img/es/eventstory/meteorimpact/monologue_2.jpg %}

{% bubble Shinobu %}
zzz…zzz…♪

Mmn… Nyufufu, it is only natural for me to do my duty as a ninja… <th>*(mumble mumble)*</th>…♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
Ahaha… Sounds like he’s having a nice dream…♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata %}
that’s right. so don’t Wake him up. go to sleep, go to sleep little baby…♪[^1]
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shinobu %}
…♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki %}
Heheh. Kanata, you’re singing him a lullaby while carrying him… I’ve been thinking this often lately, but you’re more of a mama than the one who calls himself one, Mikejima-san.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata %}
being Compared to *that* is just…

well, no matter. we shouldn’t Talk any longer; it’s time to head back Home.

are you sure you’re Fine doing the rest on your own… chiaki?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki %}
Of course! I’ll get everything squeaky-clean, so I’ll leave taking the kids home to you… Kanata~♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata %}
yes. you can count on me, chiaki.

first, i must Recover my Energy to properly accomplish my Mission… *puka, puka*~♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shinobu %}
Mghg—mugaaAAA~!? How cowardly…! But a ninja shall not yield to such tortu—<em>Cough, cough!?</em>
{% endbubble %}

{% img /img/es/eventstory/meteorimpact/monologue_3.jpg %}

{% bubble Midori %}
Wai—I’ve given up trying to stop you from getting in the fountain, but at least don’t do it while you have Sengoku-kun in your hands!

He’ll drown to death…!!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata %}
ahh, i forgot. ehehe, it was an accident, really…♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora %}
Oh jeez… You’re not livin’ all on your own — Don’t just forget about us, please. If you kill Sengoku-kun by “accident,” he won’t be able to rest in peace…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata %}
yes! i am aware! the five of us together are Ryuseitai~♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora %}
…Oh yeah, this reminds me. I heard this from Taishou, but Ryuseitai had a lot of members in the past, right?

Taichou was so eager to tell us how it’s the first time the unit has had five people, so I sorta had the wrong impression at first…

Or like, he just looked so happy when he told us, so I thought, “Oh, I guess I shouldn’t let myself quit this unit then, huh…”
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
Huh? You’re planning to leave? Reconsider your decision, please! Don’t leave me behind with this group of idiots…!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora %}
Nah, I’m not. We’re gonna live and die together~ Although, I *did* wanna join Akatsuki at first.

But at this point, Ryuseitai is like family to me. Our bond is too deep to break apart, even if I tried.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata %}
yes. fufufu~ i have made many Families before i knew it… not that i ever Wished for any of it.

god does not Wish for things, after all.

ah, but… that’s right… i am not a god, am i?

chiaki told me that, but… i had always believed myself as such, so it is still hard for me to shake off the thought…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora %}
…? Um, what do you mean?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata %}
do you want to know? if you Wish for it, i’ll grant it… just kidding~♪

actually, no… you should know about it too, shouldn’t you? we’re Family, so we shouldn’t have Secrets between us.

i can also answer tetora’s Question from a moment ago, too.

let’s talk about it. our Story—Ryuseitai’s story.

i’m not Used to these things, so please Tell me if there are any strange things i say.

i don’t know the Full story myself, so i’m sure there will be Many missing parts to the story.

but please, do listen. please, know and understand — about the hero who saved the World.

once upon a time… a Meteorite fell down in some place—
