<th>(Urmmm…)</th>

<th>(Nope, no good. No matter how much I stare at this billboard, nothing new will suddenly appear. The number of jobs to choose from has clearly decreased.)</th>

<th>(I guess we’re in recession, in a way. After all, last year’s graduates had a bad reputation within the industry, so our school’s been getting less job offers.)</th>

<th>(That’s just how society is. They won’t hire incapable people…)</th>

<th>(Even the graduates, who had been doing so well in school, have been retiring from the industry, and disappearing into the void.)</th>

<th>(There are some exceptions, like the super idol Hidaka Seiya, who continues to work in the industry to this day, but…)</th>

<th>(There’s a decline in the industry itself at this point, I think. Idols don’t last very long anymore, it seems.)</th>

<th>(Is everything really going to be alright when it’s like this…? Or has the idol industry become incapable of holding itself up…?)</th>

<th>(Ahh, it all just feels so disheartening…)</th>

<th>(No, no! Don’t think that way! You just have to keep trying to find the good things in life!)</th>

<th>(After all, I still have the stuntman job the previous captain introduced me to, so my own income is alright.)</th>

<th>(Although I’d hoped I could save up money through idol work instead… But that’s a little tricky right now.)</th>

<th>(The previous captain ended up going to the USA as planned, and someone did inherit the Captain role after him, but…)</th>

<th>(I don’t want to badmouth one of my own unit mates, but our current captain is the type who just tries to get through by sucking up to people.)</th>

<th>(He doesn’t seem like he intends to work properly as an idol — all he’s good at is cutting corners.)</th>

<th>(Mikejima-san has been appointed vice-captain, and for some reason, the captain pretends to work hard only when he’s around… other than that, he just plays around.)</th>

<th>(After we became second-years, Mikejima-san has been travelling overseas even more than before for some reason…)</th>

<th>(So whenever he’s not around, everyone starts doing whatever they want, like they’re trying to vent out their pent-up grudges.)</th>

<th>(Some members couldn’t even tolerate stopping themselves from messing around, so they’ve been transferring to Chess instead, where everyone messes around all the time, whenever they feel like.)</th>

<th>(Ryuseitai is losing both value and people.)</th>

<th>(I do want to stop this, but nothing I say has any influence. I feel like they start to treat me even worse, instead.)</th>
{% endbubble %}
{% img /img/es/eventstory/meteorimpact/secondhalfch1_1.jpg %}
{% bubble ChiakiPast serious %}
<th>(But I can’t complain at all… Last year, when everyone got serious for a while… apparently, that was because of my “wish”.)</th>

<th>(Apparently, to grant my wish, Shinkai-kun got Mikejima-san involved, since he was already in Ryuseitai… and that’s how the unit turned out the way it did last year.)</th>

<th>(Yeah, that makes sense… Not only the previous captain, but everyone else had suddenly changed their attitudes, too. Like it was magic… Like a miracle…)</th>

<th>(It all happened because that’s what that kid called “God” wanted.)</th>

<th>(I asked Mikejima-san to tell Shinkai-kun to stop doing anything like that anymore, so…)</th>

<th>(It would only be absurd to “wish” for the same thing yet again.)</th>

<th>(Threatening the lazy members to force them to work hard would be awful, anyway…)</th>

<th>(It is frustrating, and it is lonely, but I have no other choice… Enough relying on other people — I’ll do what I can by myself.)</th>

<th>(I’ll never wish for anything ever again.)</th>

<th>(This world has no room for daydreams, so I just have to do what I can, as hard as I can.)</th>

<th>(That would be enough, wouldn’t it, Mikejima-san?)</th>

<th>(Shinkai-kun… You may think it’s unfortunate that you couldn’t get me to wish for something—)</th>

<th>(And if that would make you sad, then I do feel a little bad refusing to do so, but—)</th>

<th>(I’m really sorry. I don’t think I could protect your smile.)</th>

{% bubble Subaru %}
Heey~

Sorry, but you’re in my way, so~ Move, Morisenpai.

{% endbubble %}
{% bubble ChiakiPast %}
Woah—! Oh, Akehoshi-kun! Hello! I’ve told you this so many times by now, but it’s not “Mori”, I’m *Morisawa*!

{% endbubble %}
{% bubble Subaru %}
Oh, right. Sorry, sorry, I just call anyone I’m not interested in whatever comes to mind.

{% endbubble %}
{% bubble ChiakiPast %}
No interest!? That’s mean!

Ah, but Senpai thinks your honesty is a good thing! Let me praise you, come on over, c’mon, c’mon… ♪

{% endbubble %}
{% bubble Subaru %}
Don’t call me over like a dog. You really are a weirdo, Morisenpai…

{% endbubble %}
{% bubble ChiakiPast %}
Like I said, I’m Morisaw—oh well… Anyway, is there something I can do for you?

Do you get anxious if you don’t see me at least once a day? Ooh, you little~♪

{% endbubble %}
{% bubble Subaru %}
Nope, not one bit. I’m just here to check if there’s any job offers. Are you doing the same thing, Senpai?

{% endbubble %}
{% bubble ChiakiPast %}
Yup! But as you can see, the number of them is decreasing.

{% endbubble %}
{% bubble Subaru %}
Oh, is that so… Ahh, that puts me in a bind~ I mean, all I’ve been doing is solo activity lately.

But since the in-school jobs are based on that “DreamFes” thing, I can’t get any of them as a solo idol anymore.

{% endbubble %}
{% bubble ChiakiPast %}
Hm. So you aren’t part of a unit? Then how about Ryuseitai? You’re always welcome with open arms!

{% endbubble %}
{% bubble Subaru %}
Ehh~ Isn’t your unit just a bunch of lazy bums?

Everyone in a unit gets equally rewarded, so I bet they’d just mooch off of all my hard work.

I don’t see the point in teaming up with people if it’s going to be that way. Me and my mom’re in a rough spot financially right now; I wanna make as much money as I can.

If I don’t start making money, my mom’ll have to work harder than she can handle.

{% endbubble %}
{% bubble ChiakiPast %}
I see… That must be rough. If you’re alright with doing stunt work, I could introduce you to the place I work at; how about it?

{% endbubble %}
{% bubble Subaru %}
Mrm, nah… I wanna make my way in life as an idol.

I mean, I won’t have any other choice if my situation gets bad enough, but~ I can make do with solo work at the moment.

So don’t worry about it. ‘Kay, I’ll see ya later~ Just spotted a nice job, so I’m gonna head over there and check it out.

{% endbubble %}
{% bubble ChiakiPast %}
Ooh, you’ve got keen eyesight! You could become a great basketball player! Come visit the basketball club sometime, Akehoshi-kun.

{% endbubble %}
{% bubble Subaru %}
Yeah, if I feel like it~ Bye bye now, *Morisawasenpai!*

{% endbubble %}
{% bubble ChiakiPast %}
<th>(Oh! He called me by my name. The way he said it sounded weird, though…)</th>

<th>(He’s usually cold and distant, like a wild animal… But he still listens to what I say.)</th>

<th>(Ahh, it makes me happy~ Juniors are so nice to have…)</th>

<th>(Aaalright! I’m going to work hard too, so I can become a proud senior! ♪)</th>

<th>(Hang in there! Don’t lose now, Morisawa Chiaki!)</th>

## Chapter 2
{% note location %}
**Location:** Gym
{% endnote %}
{% img /img/es/eventstory/meteorimpact/secondhalfch2.jpg %}
{% note narration %}
**Time:** Same day, after classes
{% endnote %}

{% bubble ChiakiPast %}
Bam! Take this! Finishing move: Super Chiaki Shoot…!! ☆

*Heh*… One point for me! Justice always prevails!
{% endbubble %}
{% bubble Subaru %}
… Huh, you talk to yourself a lot, *Morisawasenpai.*

{% endbubble %}
{% bubble ChiakiPast %}
Eeek!? D-d-d-don’t scare me like that, Akehoshi-kun! When did you get here!? It’s rude to sneak up behind people! I thought I was going to die!

{% endbubble %}
{% bubble Subaru %}
Hm\~? Dying from shock? Are you a little animal or somethin’~?

Hehe, it’s all good, though. It’s cute.

{% endbubble %}
{% bubble ChiakiPast %}
Hrmph! How could you say “cute” to your *senior*!? You’re so cheeky! But I guess you’re complimenting me, so in a sense, thank you!

Anyway… What’s wrong? Are you going to join club activities today? Didn’t you say you found a job earlier today, though…?

{% endbubble %}
{% bubble Subaru %}
Whaa~ You’re the one who told me to show up sometimes.

… I rejected the job offer after learning the details.

{% endbubble %}
{% bubble ChiakiPast %}
R-Really? Why is that? Did they say something bad to you!? You poor thing! Let me make you feel better!

{% endbubble %}
{% bubble Subaru %}
Nope. When I went there, they asked me to be the substitute for someone I dunno~ I mean, it would’ve been fine if it were something similar to a pinch hitter, but—

I wasn’t *just* gonna be said person’s substitute, they wanted me to work in the “background”—Basically, they wanted me to hide my face in a radio show and imitate his voice… Like, they were asking for way too much.

Well, technically I *can* do that, since the person in question is a pretty famous idol, and I more or less get how his character works, but…

{% endbubble %}
{% bubble ChiakiPast %}
Hm. I’m only asking out of curiosity, but who may you be referring to?

You don’t have to tell me if it’s confidential, but — I feel like I’ve heard something like this before, so I’m sort of curious.

If I remember clearly, he’s a famous idol who works solo, and goes by the name Hi… Hi-something[^1], wasn’t it…?

{% endbubble %}
{% bubble Subaru %}
Hrmm, they did tell me to keep it secret, but… I didn’t sign a contract or anything, so I guess it’s okay to tell you…

Or maybe not, since it may affect his reputation… I’m gonna keep it to myself.

{% endbubble %}
{% bubble ChiakiPast %}
Alright then. You respect people’s reputation, huh? I’m proud of you for being so considerate~♪

{% endbubble %}
{% bubble Subaru %}
Umm, it doesn’t make me happy being complimented by *you*~…

Anyways. Now that I’ve got free time, I figured I could come over to the club to kill some time.

I didn’t bring my P.E. uniform, though. If you have a spare with you, could you let me borrow it?

{% endbubble %}
{% bubble ChiakiPast %}
Oh! I’ve got something great for that! I was just planning to change myself! You see, we have uniforms for practicing!

Which number would you like? You can choose any of them! Ah—but I’m not handing over number four, okay!?[^2]

{% endbubble %}
{% bubble Subaru %}
I don’t mind anything~ … So there were practice uniforms? Is that normal for a basketball club? I’m a beginner, so I dunno much.

{% endbubble %}
{% bubble ChiakiPast %}
No, it’s pretty rare. Usually you only wear a uniform during a match.

But since this is a basketball club in an idol school, there was once a time when a magazine company wanted to take candid shots for an article, so…

Now we have practice uniforms—or, well, uniforms for photos.

{% endbubble %}
{% bubble Subaru %}
Ahh, I see, the photos wouldn’t be good enough in P.E. uniforms, yeah? It’s actually pretty hard to tell this is a basketball club without someone at least holding the ball.

{% endbubble %}
{% bubble ChiakiPast %}
Exactly! You’re really smart, Akehoshi-kun! You understand things so well, it’s wonderful~♪

{% endbubble %}
{% bubble Subaru %}
I feel like you praise me over just about anything… It’s super overbearing, like you’re making fun of me instead.

{% endbubble %}
{% bubble ChiakiPast %}
That’s not my intention at all~! … I’ve never once been praised by my seniors, so I thought to make sure to pour all my love into my juniors once I had my own!

{% endbubble %}
{% bubble Subaru %}
Hmm~ So you’ve always been a useless one, Senpai?

{% endbubble %}
{% bubble ChiakiPast %}
I’m not useless, though!? No, actually, the “always” part is what hurts! I mean, regardless of how I may had been in the past, I’ve at least grown splendidly now!

C’mon, c’mon~! Look at my wonderfully built abs…☆

{% endbubble %}
{% bubble Subaru %}
Huh!? Why’re you stripping!? I’ll call the police!

{% endbubble %}
{% bubble ChiakiPast %}
Please don’t! I said I’d change my clothes, didn’t I!?

You went too far with that joke; Senpai would love a kid who’s much more honest and attached to them, y’know!?

{% endbubble %}
{% bubble Subaru %}
I don’t wanna be loved by you, anyway\~ … But alright, maybe I was a little too mean. Sorry, sorry\~ It’s just becoming so much fun to tease you~♪
{% endbubble %}
## Chapter 3
{% note location %}
**Location:** Front Gate
{% endnote %}
{% img /img/es/eventstory/meteorimpact/secondhalfch3.jpg %}
{% note narration %}
**Time:** Few hours later
{% endnote %}
{% bubble ChiakiPast %}
Aaalright! Time to head home, Akehoshi-kun!

Let’s check if it’s safe! Right’s all clear! Left’s all clear! All is clear! Here we gooo~! ☆

{% endbubble %}
{% bubble Subaru %}
Umm~… You don’t have to walk me back home, y’know. I told you before — My house isn’t that far away.

{% endbubble %}
{% bubble ChiakiPast %}
No! Let me walk you back home, please! I’ve yearned to do something like this as a senior…! Thank you, Akehoshi-kun! You always make my dreams come true~♪

{% endbubble %}
{% bubble Subaru %}
*Huh*? You were talking to me much more politely just a second ago; why’d you suddenly start being more casual?[^3]

Don’t start shortening the distance between us for no reason~ It’s *way* too friendly, like you think you’re above me or something — It annoys me!

{% endbubble %}
{% bubble ChiakiPast %}
Huh? I’m sorry! I thought talking to you that way made me seem cold, like we don’t know each other…!

{% endbubble %}
{% bubble Subaru %}
We *don’t*. But whatever~ Do as you like.

{% endbubble %}
{% bubble ChiakiPast %}
Mhm, I will\~! It’s dangerous to walk at night, so we’ll go home together\~! C’mon, c’mon! Let’s walk while holding hands~♪

{% endbubble %}
{% bubble Subaru %}
I didn’t say you could do *that*! Stay, stay! You’re so overbearing, oh my *God*…!
{% endbubble %}
{% img /img/es/eventstory/meteorimpact/secondhalfch3_1.jpg %}
{% bubble Subaru sad %}
… Senpai, did you…

About me—no, about my dad[^4], you—…

No, nevermind.

{% endbubble %}
{% bubble ChiakiPast %}
Hm? What’s wrong? If there’s anything you want to say, go ahead and say it!

I’m still new to being a senior to someone, so I’m sure I’m far from perfect as one! I’ll fix anything you point out to me!

{% endbubble %}
{% bubble Subaru %}
Mm~ Shouldn’t you say that to the juniors in your unit, instead?

{% endbubble %}
{% bubble ChiakiPast %}
Ah, no… No first years joined our unit this year.

Ryuseitai has a long history, and thanks to its old-fashioned camaraderie, the unit became a bit reclusive.

And, well, it’s gotten even worse this year.

The new captain is the type to be satisfied by just having fun with like-minded people. He hasn’t bothered to scout new members, and even drives away anyone he can’t stand.

{% endbubble %}
{% bubble Subaru %}
Woah! What kinda hell is that…!? It doesn’t suit you at all! Why’re you sticking around in a place like that? There’s no way you agree with that, right?

{% endbubble %}
{% bubble ChiakiPast %}
Yeah… Honestly, I’ve often considered transferring to a different unit, or maybe just leaving units altogether and working solo, but… I can’t get myself to entirely give up on the whole unit…

Ryuseitai is my exact ideal image, since originally its concept was to be both idols and heroes.

Also, maybe the previous captain was just being nice, but he encouraged me. His words to me were: “I leave the rest to you,” and “hang in there.”

And then he told me, “become a great hero.” He patted me on the back and head, and I guess he must’ve been weirdly energetic that day, because then, for once, he hugged me.

Right at that moment, I felt like I had inherited the spirit of Ryuseitai—the very first idol unit to have been established in Yumenosaki Academy—

Like I inherited the burning, passionate spirit of justice. … Ryuseitai is corrupted right now, no doubt about it. But the lazy members who do as they please are all third years.

Once they graduate… The next captain will be Mikejima-san, if we’re looking at who has the skills for it.

I don’t really understand him very well, and he’s kind of terrifying, but he does his job well, has a good reputation overseas, and has a record of his accomplishments.

We’ll make him the next captain, and then we’ll do as best as we can to support him, and… If we work hard, I’m sure Ryuseitai will be reborn. Next year’s when the real game begins—no, that’s when it’ll be our turn!

That’s what I believe in. There’s hope for the future, so I can bear with anything that comes my way!

{% endbubble %}
{% bubble Subaru %}
Hmmm. I feel like you’re avoiding the real problem here, or like, you’re trying to come up with excuses.

I mean, all I hear about Ryuseitai is bad news. If things don’t go well, the school’s staff might have their eyes on you, or the unit’ll be demolished by next year, or something.

{% endbubble %}
{% bubble ChiakiPast %}
Don’t say such terrifying things… It’ll be just fine. No—I’ll make sure that doesn’t happen. I promise you: I *will* protect Ryuseitai.

{% endbubble %}
{% bubble Subaru %}
I don’t think there’s much point to promising *me* that, but… Well, do as you like. It’s your life, Senpai.

… Hey, if Ryuseitai really is reborn next year… and if you’re still up for that offer by then, and I still haven’t been able to do any work except solo…

Invite me then, okay? I might agree to join if anything like that were to happen.

{% endbubble %}
{% bubble ChiakiPast %}
Oh!? Got it! That’s our promise to each other! Believe in me, Akehoshi-kun! A hero never breaks his promise with a kid!

{% endbubble %}
{% bubble Subaru %}
Huuuh? When did *you* become a hero, *Morisawasenpai*?

Also, don’t tell me the “kid” is me. We’re only a year apart, ‘kay? Gosh, you act so high and mighty…

… But that’s okay. If only a hero really had existed when I was in the worst time of my life…

… Hm?

{% endbubble %}
{% bubble ChiakiPast %}
? What’s wrong?

{% endbubble %}
{% bubble Subaru %}
Uh… Look up there, Senpai. Is it just me, or is it a little too bright up on the roof? I thought there was a fire for a second there.

{% endbubble %}
{% bubble ChiakiPast %}
Hmm? You have such keen eyesight, Akehoshi-kun! And your attentiveness is incredible! You really do have what it takes to be an excellent basketball pla—Wait, what?

<th>(Ooh? What are those people wearing our school uniform doing on the rooftop? Are they waving light sticks…?)</th>

<th>(Is there a live show happening? No, wait, but… I don’t think anyone is allowed on the rooftop late at night, so…?)</th>

{% endbubble %}
{% bubble Subaru %}
Ahh~ Is that the rumored “Yaobikuni”…? This is the first time I’ve seen them.

{% endbubble %}
{% bubble ChiakiPast %}
Y-Yaobikuni? The legendary story about eating mermaid flesh and becoming immortal?

{% endbubble %}
{% bubble Subaru %}
Ah, no, I don’t actually know what it’s about. It’s just the rumor recently, I think. Sakasaki-kun’s in my class, see—He knows a lot about weird stuff like that.

He’s one of the few friends I have that I can casually talk to, so we have chats sometimes.

That’s when he told me that there’s an illegal circle called “Yaobikuni” in our school.

I dunno how much of it is true, but apparently they’re a religious cult or some secret group.

What was his name again…? Ah! Someone called “Shin kai ka na ta” is acting as the founder of the group.

{% endbubble %}
{% bubble ChiakiPast %}
Huh!? Shinkai-kun is the…!?

{% endbubble %}
{% bubble Subaru %}
Oh? Do you know him? Yeah, he’s that… What was it, Five Eccentrics?

He’s one of the people who’re called by that name — They’re the most excellent, outstanding idols in this school, yeah~?

Well, the Five Eccentrics are just outstanding idols — I doubt any of them are actually cult leaders, or Gods, or whatever…

Buuut, those are the kinda rumors you hear.

People talking about how it’s totally true that that “Shin kai ka na ta” guy will grant any of your wishes.

## Chapter 4
{% note cw %}
**Content Warning:** Emetophobia and light mentions of cannibalism ahead.
{% endnote %}
{% note location %}
**Location:** Rooftop
{% endnote %}

{% note narration %}
**Time:** A few days later, after classes
{% endnote %}

{% bubble ChiakiPast serious %}
……

<th>(… Yeah, there’s definitely signs that a huge number of people have been conducting secret meetings here. What I witnessed a few days ago was no illusion or dream.)</th>

<th>(It doesn’t give off the sense that it’s been used as a gathering place for delinquents, either. Although unfortunately, there *are* people like that in this school.)</th>

<th>(I’m already aware of that, since they always throw litter all over the ground. I couldn’t stand seeing the place littered, so I typically clean this area.)</th>

<th>(But, those “Yaobikuni” people… Something feels off about them.)</th>

<th>(No one is supposed to go to the rooftop of the academy, which may be why it’s starting to look a bit dirty around here. This also means footsteps are left behind.)</th>

<th>(Yet, these people have been wiping their traces off the ground before leaving.)</th>

<th>(But the fact that the ground is so clean next to everything else *is* what makes it so obviously unnatural.)</th>

<th>(There's even a sweet lingering scent left behind.)</th>

<th>(It doesn’t smell like candy or juice, so what is it… Incense sticks, maybe? It can’t be tobacco—Maybe it’s musk?)</th>

<th>(It makes me think of those aromas used for religious purposes!)</th>

<th>(It’s just too suspicious! What’s going on? Who are these Yaobikuni people?)</th>

<th>(What are they doing in the corners of our school?)</th>

<th>(Is Shinkai-kun really acting as their founder…?)</th>

<th>(Why? How did that happen? I don’t understand, and that makes me feel all the more uneasy!)</th>

<th>(……)</th>

<th>(… What am I even doing…? No one asked me to do this, yet I’m acting like a detective just because I’m a little curious.)</th>

<th>(Mikejima-san even warned me to not get involved—to not dig any deeper into this…)</th>

yes? what is it, shu?

that was your Name, right? you have a Name, all of you! hehehe~…♪

and so! because my Name is shinkai kanata, you called me “Kanata”, yes? am i right?

{% endbubble %}
{% bubble Shu %}
Yes, you’re correct. However, I still don’t understand what you’re trying to say.

It is painfully clear to me that you have had quite a unique lifestyle for half of your lifetime, but how does that have anything to do with me? I don’t see where this conversation is heading.

{% endbubble %}

huh? it is Painful for you? shall i cure you? curing is my Weakest point, though…?

ah! i heard Mermaid flesh works for all kinds of Diseases! how about you try eating me~? ♪

{% bubble Shu %}
Kanata. I will try my best to allow the lot of you to do as you please—or rather, I’ve come to understand just through our very short acquaintanceship, that anything I say to any of you is futile.

However, as you can see, I am currently sewing.

I am not so amateur that a gaze would interfere with the quality of my work, but frankly speaking… You are being an eyesore.

{% endbubble %}
{% bubble KanataPast %}
an eyesore? that is Not good, there may be a Possibility that even your Eyes are not Feeling well! you have many Diseases all over your body, don’t you, shu?

{% endbubble %}
{% bubble Shu %}
Are you doing this on purpose, is that it? Are you *trying* to provoke me?

{% endbubble %}
{% bubble KanataPast %}
on purpose? about what? hmm… the Things shu says are difficult~

{% endbubble %}
{% bubble Shu %}
People often say that about me. However, you are different from the ordinary masses, are you not? You are intelligent enough to comprehend the meaning behind my words, correct?

Surely you must, as you are of equal rank to me… as we are both part of the Five Eccentrics, the name that was pushed onto us by the masses—yes?

{% endbubble %}
{% bubble KanataPast %}
yes. to be part of something together means that we are the same, right?

hehehe. it makes me Happy to share something in Common…♪

{% endbubble %}
{% bubble Shu %}
I am not the least bit happy about it. I, Itsuki Shu, am at the top of all creations—a transcendence that no other may stand next to.

Being grouped with four more people for being similar makes me feel like my worth among the mass is underestimated. It is unpleasant.

Especially you—You act so high and mighty.

Usually, it is that nagging Wataru and Rei that make idle talk, so the two of us rarely ever speak one on one, like we are doing right now.

But everytime you speak, you start spouting things about being a God, that you grant wishes, or what-have-you… Who do you think you are? Do you think you’re a savior of some sort—that you have been dispatched by the high heavens to rescue all living things?

{% endbubble %}
{% bubble KanataPast %}
hm? it is not the Heavens that i come from~ it is the Sea! also, i am not a Savior, but a God♪

because i am a God, i grant Wishes! shu, what is your Wish?

{% endbubble %}
{% bubble Shu %}
… You really aren’t listening to me at all, are you?

You’ll grant my wish? *Ha*! Don’t make me laugh! That’s something one only says to those they think are below them. Are you trying to say that you are *above* me?

{% endbubble %}
{% bubble KanataPast %}
hm~? are Humans not generally Below me? which is why i can watch over them from Above, and Help them…?

{% endbubble %}
{% bubble Shu %}
… I will skip past the nerve you hit just now — I simply pity you at this point. I will make this very clear to you: I do not plan to have faith in anyone but myself.

I suppose if I *must* specify something, then I do have a longing towards muses.

However, that description is more suitable to someone such as Nito — You, on the other hand, would be more comparable to a siren, no?

{% endbubble %}
{% bubble KanataPast %}
psy…che…?[^7]

{% endbubble %}
{% bubble Shu %}
Not psyche, *siren*. It may only be folktale, but they are said to be mermaids.

Muses and sirens may be mythical creatures related to water, but sirens are monsters—far different from my beloved muses.[^8]

{% endbubble %}
{% bubble KanataPast %}
i am… not a Monster, you know…?

{% endbubble %}
{% bubble Shu %}
… Such an unbearably sad face you’re making. I cannot tell where your discomforts lie at all. Perhaps that was not the right word choice, I suppose I’ll withdraw what I said.

{% endbubble %}

**Time:** Next day, after classes
{% endnote %}
{% bubble KuroPast smile %}
—And that’s all I’ve got to report. What’s your next move, Bocchan?

{% endbubble %}
{% bubble KeitoPast %}
First, stop calling me that. You switched to a different name for a while, but now you’re back to the first one for some reason.

How incorrigible. I suppose that’s meant to be a nickname, but I just feel like you’re making a fool of me instead. I don’t particularly like it.

{% endbubble %}
{% bubble KuroPast smile %}
Haha, then what should I call ya? Vice-prez? Kei-chan?

{% endbubble %}
{% bubble KeitoPast %}
Call me whatever you like. I’m already asking a huge favor from you for this plan, so I prefer to respect your free will to some extent.

Do be aware that I’m not trying to control you, but rather trying to let you make use of the Student Council as you please.

{% endbubble %}
{% bubble KuroPast smile %}
Hmmm. And what can this newborn, shabby-lookin’ Student Council even do for me, eh?

{% endbubble %}
{% bubble KeitoPast %}
What I can offer you for now is authority. If I make everything that you’re doing part of the Student Council’s duties, then it will become a part of justice.

And it’s unlikely that you will misuse what is labeled as “justice,” correct? I trust you on that part.

Or rather, I’m trying to take advantage of your good, sensible mind, and restrain your movement *because* I know you won’t misuse it.

{% endbubble %}
{% bubble KuroPast smile %}
Haha. You sure you wanna tell me all about your ulterior motives?

{% endbubble %}
{% bubble KeitoPast %}
Based on everything I know about you, I’ve concluded that the best way to ask for your help is to tell you my real intentions from the start, rather than trick you into helping me.

We may end up being together for a long while, after all. I’m looking at the wider picture here, since I’d like to properly advance my plans according to what will become useful in the long run.

I just need to win the game by the end. Perseverance is what prevails, and that’s why I’ve been building up my assets slowly, but surely.

<th>(However, as for Eichi… He doesn’t know how long he has left to live, due to his weak constitution… Thus, he may be appalled by how I’m taking my sweet time with this plan. Actually—He might even curse at me for it.)</th>

<th>(Still, I won’t be able to make any real progress by rushing the plan—I’m only human, after all.)</th>

<th>(I would be left with nothing in my hands, and all of it would go to waste.)</th>

<th>(That’s what I learnt after what happened with Sakuma-san.)</th>

<th>(Don’t rush, don’t panic… Take deep breaths in between…♪)</th>

{% endbubble %}
{% img /img/es/eventstory/meteorimpact/secondhalfch6_1.jpg %}
{% bubble SoumaPast %}
Forgive me for intruding. Hasumi-dono, could you permit me to speak?

{% endbubble %}
{% bubble KeitoPast %}
…!? Ahh, you surprised me! You were here, Kanzaki!?

{% endbubble %}
{% bubble SoumaPast %}
Yes, I have been here from the start. I believe that Kiryu-dono was aware of my presence…

However, you both appeared to be speaking very earnestly about something, so I did not wish to intrude, and refrained from expressing my thoughts.

{% endbubble %}
{% bubble KuroPast smile %}
Haha, I was wonderin’ why you were ignorin’ him… So you didn’t even realize he was there, *Hasumi*?

{% endbubble %}
{% bubble KeitoPast %}
So you’re going to call me by my family name? Fine, so be it… Anyhow, Kanzaki — You’re a member of Akatsuki, too. You don’t need to constantly ask for permission to speak.

We are equal in this unit. Rather, *all* human beings are meant to be equal to each other. There is no need to speak to me in a formal manner, like you’re a samurai serving your lord.

{% endbubble %}
{% bubble SoumaPast %}
… I see. It appears that I have actually been disrespectful through my asking for permission. I apologize. But I also cannot help it; I am not used to acting as a group.

More importantly, I wish to inquire about the mysterious group that Kiryu-dono has informed us of, the “Yaobikuni”.

{% endbubble %}
{% bubble KeitoPast %}
Ahh, are you also curious about it? It didn’t seem to be a mere superstition…

Thus, I asked Kiryu to investigate what’s been happening, as he has connections with the delinquents in this academy.

{% endbubble %}
{% bubble KuroPast smile %}
Ah, yeah. Sometimes I ask for some stuff from shady jobs, though those jobs have also become a part-time thing within school.

So yeah, I’d have more connections with those shady guys than you, the goodie-two-shoes honor student.

… If Akatsuki and the Student Council are meant to be “justice,” then should I cut my ties with those guys?

My history with them might end up being a weak point to target for the Student Council, y’know?

{% endbubble %}
{% bubble KeitoPast %}
No, it’s alright. That would be far too unnecessary.

{% endbubble %}
{% bubble KuroPast smile %}
Haha, alright, but if that ever happens, you can throw away the punks, includin’ me.

{% endbubble %}
{% bubble KeitoPast %}
I have *no* plans to do that. Besides, the dark and light of this world are blended with each other.

I’m not so happy-go-lucky that I would dream of an ideal paradise where all evil has been extinguished. I’m not a kid, you know.

I—*We* need you. I’ve lived all my life in an upstanding manner, and that’s exactly why I need someone like you, who can reach those places I’m not well-acquainted with, and can’t reach on my own.

{% endbubble %}
{% bubble KuroPast smile %}
That so? Well, being needed doesn’t feel so bad. I appreciate it, makes me wanna cry a li’l bit.

{% endbubble %}
{% bubble SoumaPast %}
Hehe, so even demons[^9] shed tears. Though, I do admit that your discussion right now was a little too difficult for me to comprehend.

{% endbubble %}
{% bubble KeitoPast %}
Don’t think about it too much, it’s only small talk. That aside—You’re interested in the Yaobikuni, Kanzaki? Don’t tell me you’re also a worshipper.

{% endbubble %}
{% bubble SoumaPast %}
Mm, a “worshipper”? Is this “Yaobikuni” related to a religion of some sort?

{% endbubble %}
{% bubble KuroPast smile %}
Seems like it. It ain’t an officially recognized group in school or anythin’; it sounds like it’s some kinda network that somehow just came to be.

## Chapter 7
{% note cw %}
**Content Warning:** Mentions of violence ahead.
{% endnote %}
{% img /img/es/eventstory/meteorimpact/secondhalfch7.jpg %}

{% bubble KeitoPast %}
Yes. You see, the Yaobikuni don’t appear to have proper headquarters of any sort.

They are simply a large society, keeping in contact with each other for essential information, done through encrypted text messages.

There seems to be no need to perform a ritual, nor pay a fee to join the group.

I’m sure there must be people who aren’t even aware that they’re part of the Yaobikuni due to this.

{% endbubble %}
{% bubble SoumaPast %}
Hmm… It is like trying to grasp a cloud.

{% endbubble %}
{% bubble KeitoPast %}
Exactly. There does appear to be someone at the center of the group who is currently acting as the religious founder for them, but…

He doesn’t seem to have any intention of creating or managing the organization.

It seems to be nothing but the group simply prancing around him however they please.

They don't seem to be doing anything terrible at the moment—the only exceptions are the fervent ones trespassing onto the school rooftop, but that's a trivial violation.

So we *could* just leave them aside for now, but—

They’re starting to grow much too large to ignore, and their bizarre and illogical movements make me uneasy.

I don’t particularly like how it feels like the academy is being slowly taken over by an unknown group of people.

… Cursed cult. They’re so infuriating — Our modern society doesn’t need any religions.

{% endbubble %}
{% bubble KuroPast smile %}
Haha, you’re one to talk, Mr. “I’m the son of a temple”.

{% endbubble %}
{% bubble KeitoPast %}
I’m saying this *because* I am one. I know how frightening religions can be. Though for now, it appears to be nothing but a substitute for one—a secret “good luck charm”, if you will.

But, at worst, this may become a large obstruction in our path. After all, the ones the student body should trust is us, the Student Council.

… Maybe I *should* nip the bud before it sprouts a disaster…

{% endbubble %}
{% bubble KuroPast smile %}
How, though? We’ve got no real authority to do that — You gonna try and change the rules to ban believin’ in religious faith in school?

{% endbubble %}
{% bubble KeitoPast %}
No, students should be free to have faith as they please. Also, the Student Council has an insignificant amount of authority, so we won’t get anywhere trying to change the school rules.

Everyone would simply ignore them, and it would be all over for us.

There is no point trying to provoke the worshippers without planning beforehand.

{% endbubble %}
{% bubble KuroPast smile %}
That’s gonna be annoyin’, then… Can’t we just beat up the bad guy and get this done and over with?

… Nah, we can’t, can we… Nothin’s that simple.

Sorry. I keep asking far too much of you.

{% endbubble %}

*Huh?* Don’t act like we’re strangers here. I would'a told you by now if this was too much for me, anyway. I’m helpin’ ya ‘cuz I *want* to, aight? You lookin’ down on me or somethin’?

{% endbubble %}
{% bubble SoumaPast %}
Yes. I feel the same as Kiryu-dono — there is no need for you to be concerned. It would not be an apology, but rather an insult, Hasumi-dono.

In any case, I would like to propose an idea.

Would you please entrust this “Yaobikuni” matter to me? I, Kanzaki Souma, shall handle it.

{% endbubble %}
{% bubble KeitoPast %}
… Entrust it to you?

{% endbubble %}
{% bubble KuroPast smile %}
Oh? Got an idea or somethin’, Kanzaki?

I don’t feel like there’s much anyone could do about this vague problem of ours, but — did you get a breakthrough to solvin’ it or somethin’?

{% endbubble %}
{% bubble SoumaPast %}
Ah, no. I am uncertain whether I will be capable of resolving the issue or not. It is merely that I have ties to the founder of that “Yaobikuni” group.

{% endbubble %}
{% bubble KeitoPast %}
Founder… *You* know Shinkai Kanata of the Five Eccentrics!?

{% endbubble %}
{% bubble SoumaPast %}
Indeed. My interpersonal interactions with him are almost nonexistent, but as our families are connected, I do know a little about him.

The things I have heard about him were a bit too different from what my parents have told me, so I have only just made the connection now.

I know the person called Shinkai Kanata.

I hold a different perspective than the one you two hold, and therefore I may be able to solve the issue… that is what I am thinking. According to all of our ancestors, a thief is required to catch a thief, correct?

<th>(……)</th>

<th>(My worst nightmare came true. Those “Yaobikuni” people really are what I vaguely assumed them to be.)</th>

<th>(To this day, Shinkai-kun is still granting wishes.)</th>

<th>(He listens to other people’s wishes by talking to them, just like he did with me — and always makes sure to grant each and every one of them.)</th>

<th>(He will fairly, indiscriminately grant all wishes… and nothing can stop him from doing so.)</th>

<th>(He keeps on going from one wish to another, no matter who it is.)</th>

<th>(Any wishes that he himself can grant would be done on the spot… For instance, wishing to be patted on the head.)</th>

<th>(When they can’t be achieved by him alone, many of his worshippers will be ready to act—)</th>

<th>(And use any means necessary to grant those wishes.)</th>

<th>(Getting a strict teacher fired for warning a student, taking down a fast food restaurant because they didn’t like how a cashier spoke to them—)</th>

<th>(Driving a kid home specifically through an expensive car because he missed the last train, buying and then giving away multiple copies of a new game console on the same day it releases…)</th>

<th>(I only searched around a little, and still managed to find plenty of stories.)</th>

<th>(I don’t think anybody was warned to keep it a secret, because there are all kinds of stories spread around on public social media accounts.)</th>

<th>(Once people hear about those rumors, they start getting curious about these wishes… and some have a prayer in their heart beforehand, leading them to tell their wishes to Shinkai-kun.)</th>

<th>(Even the people who laughed at the thought of someone being capable of doing this started to change their minds once they saw those wishes come true.)</th>

<th>(Nobody can stop themselves from wishing for more… and it keeps piling up.)</th>

<th>(And with every type of wish being granted, nobody wants to try working hard on their own—they’re all starting to believe that life is easier when you make a wish to Shinkai-kun.)</th>

<th>(They become hollow versions of themselves, and depend on him for everything. And that kept on repeating, until it got stronger, expanded further, until it formed into what you can only call a “religion”.)</th>

<th>(No… This religion existed within this region from the old times. They’re simply being taken in by those strange worshippers Mikejima-san was talking about.)</th>

<th>(Is that Shinkai-kun’s goal?)</th>

<th>(Is it to gain more worshippers, so that there are more people to worship him as a living God?)</th>

<th>(Shinkai-kun. Is that your true wish?)</th>

<th>(If so, then I don’t want to reject it. I can’t say I want to support it, but I at least don’t want to get in your way… But—)</th>

<th>(In a world that has no room for daydreams to exist, something coming true simply by wishing for it is too unnatural.)</th>

<th>(Every time that reality is ignored to grant a wish — In other words, every time someone gains something, someone else is losing something without reason.)</th>

<th>(Those who lose something will only bear a bitter grudge. They’ll try to find out how this happened, and they’ll find their way to Shinkai-kun.)</th>

<th>(And then, from their rage and need for revenge, they may hurt him.)</th>

<th>(… He hasn’t even done anything wrong. All he’s been doing is granting “wishes”…)</th>

Why yaki onigiri…? I don’t understand, but — I’m a little hungry right now, so I’ll have one.

{% endbubble %}
{% bubble Madara %}
Thank you, come again! I was feeling a little lonely, y’know! I think everyone’s weirded out by a random stall right at the front gate or something, ‘cause they’ve been ignoring me entirely!

Yaki onigiri is so tasty, though~ I guess youngsters these days prefer hamburgers and stuff?

{% endbubble %}
{% bubble ChiakiPast %}
Hehe, I also like those types of fast food. Plus, you don’t see people sell onigiri in food stalls, do you?

{% endbubble %}
{% bubble Madara %}
Seriously? But it’s been Japan’s version of fast food for centuries now! Even sushi was sold like this back in the old days, y’know?

Oh well, guess no one’s familiar with that nowadays. I gotta keep up with the modern times too—especially now that we’ve become westernized since the Meiji era.

But anyway… I didn’t have any customers up until now, so I didn’t bother making any yaki onigiri yet… You’ll have to wait some time for yours.

Nah, this is an actual interest of mine, and I figured I could make a profit from it.

Don’t think too deep on this, I’m honestly not expecting anything from you.

You may be good-natured, but you’re just an ordinary boy. I’m not gonna start depending on you for things like you’re some hero or God.

After all, it’s me who wished for you to just remain an ordinary boy, yeah?

I’m not gonna take back those words. Actually, I wanted to further state how you shouldn’t get yourself involved with what’s going on with Kanata-san.

{% endbubble %}
{% bubble ChiakiPast serious %}
……

{% endbubble %}
{% bubble Madara %}
Oh, but don’t get me wrong — I’m not taking you lightly at all. In fact, I’ve completely changed my opinion of you; I think very highly of you now.

… You were the only one.

{% endbubble %}
{% bubble ChiakiPast serious %}
…?
{% endbubble %}
{% bubble Madara %}
You were the only one who did as I said when I asked you not to wish for anything.

*And* you were the very first person who never spoke a word about any wish to Kanata-san, even after how he introduced himself to you.

I mean, even *I* wished for something once — for my sister’s disease to be cured.

Humans are weak. It’s normal for people to wish for something — to pray for some almighty being to make a miracle happen and make their lives better.

Even people who insist they’re atheists wish on shooting stars.

In a way, that just means there’s a part inside you that’s even stronger than I am… I’m almost jealous.

{% endbubble %}
{% bubble ChiakiPast worried %}
N-No, you’re wrong. I’m not strong at all, I’m just a coward.

It terrifies me to think that an unbelievable existence, like a God, could forcibly shake up everything I’ve ever known about this world, that’s all.

Even *I* wish for things. Deep in my heart, I have many fantasies I should be ashamed of.

Isn’t that why Shinkai-kun managed to guess what I subconsciously wished for, and grant them for me?

{% endbubble %}
{% bubble Madara %}
See, the key word here is that it was your *subconscious*. In reality, even after knowing he’s a God, you never once spoke a wish.

It wasn’t just because you were terrified of my warning… right?

I’ve threatened other people with the same warning, but they broke their promise and went back to clinging to “God” all over again.

They did it behind my back, thinking everything’d be fine as long as they aren’t caught.

Those kinds of people are only growing in number, so I think what I’ve been up to hasn't been pleasing Kanata-san and the more zealous worshippers…

‘Cause lately, I’m being forced to keep a distance from all this through overseas trips more than ever.

I haven’t been able to stop people from making wishes as much as I used to.

So yeah, all those people I warned could tell I was too powerless to stop them, and went right back to making wishes.

It’s pathetic of me, but I really can’t put a stop to what’s happening anymore.

{% endbubble %}
{% bubble ChiakiPast worried %}
… They haven’t been pleased with you, Mikejima-san? Is that why you’re always overseas?

{% endbubble %}
{% bubble Madara %}
Yep. I mean, I’m starting to find overseas work fun too, but this was the reason why at first.

It’s only natural this is happening; I’m a traitor to them. I’m the black sheep in the group that worships the all-knowing God Kanata-san.

While Kanata-san maintains his divinity by granting more and more wishes—

I’ve been telling every single person who finds out about him not to wish for anything.

They’re probably seeing it as me trying to kill off the God that has maintained their faith for so long.
{% endbubble %}
{% img /img/es/eventstory/meteorimpact/secondhalfch9_1.jpg %}
{% bubble Madara %}
Even Kanata-san told me off, y’know? He called me a traitor. An unfaithful, vulgar rogue.[^11]

{% endbubble %}
{% bubble ChiakiPast serious %}
That’s not true, though. Aren’t you the *only* person who’s been trying to protect him as a human being? You did it because he’s your friend—because you love him.

{% endbubble %}
{% bubble Madara %}
Nah… You’re reading me in good light, but I think I really am a traitor in the end.

That sweet-sounding talk I had with you, too — I bet it was just me putting up a front.

Maybe my real feelings toward Kanata-san are hatred, for constantly acting almighty and God-like—

Yet being unable to cure my sister, and I could only watch her suffer…

Maybe I got sick of seeing everyone be so happy, believing in that God…

And maybe I just wanna tear apart that fake charade, and laugh at them and their shocked expressions once they find out the truth.

That’s who I really am, Chiaki-san — a cruel, unfair guy.
{% endbubble %}
{% img /img/es/eventstory/meteorimpact/secondhalfch9_2.jpg %}
{% bubble ChiakiPast serious %}
Even so. There’s no such thing as a clean person — everyone holds a dirty, awful part of them inside.

There is *no* reason for you to be told off as if you aren’t just another human being like everyone else.

{% endbubble %}
{% bubble Madara %}
… Hahaha, are you getting angry at them? For my sake?

I’ve been calling you an ordinary kid, but I’m gonna change that. You’re a strange kid.

And I love strange kids…

If you were just an ordinary kid, I was going to warn you once more to make sure you never get involved, and never wish for anything — even if it meant using force.

But since you’re a strange kid, there might be something special only you can do. I don’t know what it could be right now, but there might come a day when I’ll ask you for it.

{% endbubble %}
{% bubble ChiakiPast serious %}
…?

{% endbubble %}
{% bubble Madara %}
Hahaha! Back to our main topic! Look, the roasted onigiri is ready, have a bite! I’m sure you’ve been waiting…☆

{% endbubble %}
{% bubble ChiakiPast %}
T-Thank you, they look really tasty. How much for one?

{% endbubble %}
{% bubble Madara %}
Mm~ I’ll put it on your tab for now. Consider this an advance payment for the day when I ask a favor from you.

{% endbubble %}
{% bubble ChiakiPast %}
No, that’s kind of terrifying, actually… What are you going to make me do?

{% endbubble %}
{% bubble Madara %}
Who knows? I’m no God, I don’t know what the future holds! Haha, if you catch my drift…♪

Pardon me. Are you here, Buchou-dono?

ah, umm… i Remember you. you are the one i watched the sea turtle Video with—

{% endbubble %}
{% bubble SoumaPast %}
Ah, it makes sense you do not recall who I am, as we have not encountered each other since then. My name is Kanzaki Souma, I am pleased to make your acquaintance.

{% endbubble %}
{% bubble KanataPast %}
i see… um, so, souma…? do you have Business with me?

oh! i know! you would like me to grant you a Wish, yes…? ♪

{% endbubble %}
{% bubble SoumaPast %}
Nay, it is an entirely separate matter. I have come to visit you in order to confirm a certain fact.

What a fool I am… I too am a member of the Marine Bio club, even if it is only on paper—

{% endbubble %}
{% bubble KanataPast %}
ahh… you were the one who signed the document to join, yes?

i could not make a club without at least Three members, so back then I was trying to find people to join.

kaoru had been lounging in this Room since last year…

so he told me Bluntly, “why don’t you just make this part of a club already?”

and then saying it would make it easier to Do as he likes with the club’s Budget.

i had thought that it was kaoru’s Wish… so i granted it.

but it seems i was wrong~ he told me it was simply a Joke.

so i asked him if he can Do as he likes now… and he only looked at me in annoyance. he is also a difficult one…

{% endbubble %}
{% bubble SoumaPast %}
Hm… You speak in a peculiar manner, so I am not quite sure what you are saying—

However, even if it was only a coincidence, I feel that it is fate for me to be in the same club as you.

I have been acting rude this whole time, and I humbly apologize for not having realized it was you much earlier.

{% endbubble %}
{% bubble KanataPast %}
umm…?

{% endbubble %}
{% bubble SoumaPast %}
Typically, I would show my remorse by slicing my stomach open, but please accept this apology for now.

{% endbubble %}

{% endnote %}
{% img /img/es/eventstory/meteorimpact/secondhalfch11.jpg %}

{% bubble KanataPast %}
you… ahh, your name is “Kanzaki”, yes?

is that *the* Kanzaki? the chieftain of this land—of this region?

{% endbubble %}
{% bubble SoumaPast %}
Indeed. My family has been appointed that role for several centuries now—since the Sengoku period… However, we do not have as much power as we used to in the bygone days.

Even so, we continued to pass on the contract that my ancestors had agreed upon. It had slipped my mind entirely as I hadn't known much back when this had occurred, but at one time in my youth I had been blessed with an opportunity for an audience with you.

{% endbubble %}
{% bubble KanataPast %}
Ahh~… yes, i think they come Greet me quite often. as well as people from Other households.

you do it in order to never forget the crime you committed long ago.

but, in those Ceremonies, i am always behind the Bamboo blinds…

so i could not tell it was you. it is only natural that neither of us Remember one another.

{% endbubble %}
{% bubble SoumaPast %}
Aha, I do not deserve such kind words. However, I will surely keep them in my heart for the rest of my life.

{% endbubble %}
{% bubble KanataPast %}
mrmm~… people act so friendly with me within School, so it is actually much more unnatural to hear someone speak the Usual way i am spoken to.

you do not need to speak to me so Formally, really. it is actually Harder to speak to you, as if i feel a Distance between us.

{% endbubble %}
{% bubble SoumaPast %}
Nay, I must keep a line between us. Even in Shintoism, it is said that us impure humans must only come in contact with God through the strands of the tamagushi—Even with the shrine maidens.

One must rip their ears to hear God, and crush their eyeballs to see.

{% endbubble %}
{% bubble KanataPast %}
ahh, i have heard of it. it sounds very painful…

but being kept at a distance in such a way… it truly makes me feel Lonely.

{% endbubble %}
{% bubble SoumaPast %}
Hm? Did you say something?

{% endbubble %}
{% bubble KanataPast %}
no, nothing… anyway, what did you want to Speak to me about?

did you simply want to Greet me? or do you have a Wish in mind?

{% endbubble %}
{% bubble SoumaPast %}
Nay. I cannot speak for other people, but it would be absurd of us to pray to God. It is not permissible.

That is why, at the very least — I choose to aid God’s conduct, as part of the Kanzaki clan. Typically, our role is exactly as our family name stands: To conceal and shield God[^13] during a time of perplexity—

However, from what I have heard, you seem to be accomplishing your role without any waver.

Thus, we have no reason to perform our duty. However, I wish to repay you for the kindness you have bestowed upon us—The hand of salvation that you stretched out to us.

I am the son of samurais. I have been taught to repay others by being of service to them.

{% endbubble %}
{% bubble KanataPast %}
……

{% endbubble %}
{% bubble SoumaPast %}
O dear God; surely you must feel uncomfortable in this era, as faith is gradually being lost to the times.

There are those who wish to obstruct your duties and hurt you, for they have forgotten the contract from olden times.

You see, recently I have been visiting the Student Council office, and they seem puzzled by your conduct.

I say this on behalf of Hasumi-dono’s honor, but—in this era it is more common to find people who do not know the truth, thus it is only natural that he is confused.

{% endbubble %}
{% bubble KanataPast %}
hasumi… ahh, the Temple people. we have always had trouble compromising with those people.

after all, people from the Temple believe in Buddha, and not God.

{% endbubble %}
{% bubble SoumaPast %}
Indeed. I have heard all the old tales of the disputes that occurred when people misunderstood or were ignorant of the contract, and thus, in order to avoid that from happening once more… Unworthy as I may be, I swear to protect you.

I shall make sure that you are safe from Hasumi-dono and the Student Council.

I will make the proper arrangements to ensure that, so please continue with your conducts without worries.

I do feel remorseful for decieving Hasumi-dono and breaching his trust, as he is the one who allowed me to come speak to you…

However, he is also someone I deeply respect. I do not wish to see him clash with you for such needless reasons.

Of course, there may also be a time when I must choose between fighting for you, or fighting for Hasumi-dono…

{% endbubble %}
{% bubble KanataPast %}
hm. you too are in quite a burdensome Position, i see.

poor you. shall i give you a “good boy, good boy”? kaoru said he Enjoys it when Girls do that to him.

i do not seem to be a Girl, but it may still make you a bit Happy?

{% endbubble %}
{% bubble SoumaPast %}
Oh, no, please. I could never accept such an offer. It is unforgivable for a filthy criminal such as myself to be patted on the head by God.

{% endbubble %}
{% bubble KanataPast %}
oh! “good boy, good boy” is to pat on the head, i see…

i did not quite Understand at first. i am happy you Taught me that.

i will do it to kaoru next time i see him…♪

hehe, people have only been telling me their Wishes lately… they do not Teach me anything, so a lot of things have not made Sense to me.

that child… chiaki would Teach me so much.

was he Special? maybe that is why i feel so Lonely, after not being able to Speak to him for so long…?

…? what is “Lonely”? souma, do you Know?

{% endbubble %}
{% bubble SoumaPast %}
Pardon? Um… I do know the word, but it is difficult to explain…

{% endbubble %}
{% bubble KanataPast frown %}
is that so… *sigh…* you people sure are Boring.

Heeey! Akehoshi-ku—Akehoshi! Good work at the Venus Cup!

I watched you! You were sparkling everywhere! You really are our Basketball Club’s pride!

Heheh~♪ Actually, when the performance was over, I stood around waiting for you so I could reward you for your hard work, but…

You were hugging the other people you went onstage with out of joy, so—

I thought it’s better I don’t get in your way, and held back from calling out to you! How about that!? I’m a senpai who can be considerate, aren’t I!? Feel free to praise me! ☆

But man, how nice, Akehoshi! I’m so jealous! I want to be up on stage like that, too…♪

{% endbubble %}
{% bubble Subaru worried %}
… Bucho~[^14]

{% endbubble %}
{% bubble ChiakiPast %}
Hm? Um, yep, that’s me!

Right, right! You’ve been calling me that since a while back now, haven’t you? I’m still not used to it, so I was a little late to respond!

Hehe, that’s right… Our previous club captain quit school, so I automatically took the title after—
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Subaru worried %}
Bucho~… Save me…

{% endbubble %}
{% bubble ChiakiPast worried %}
…!? W-What’s wrong!? Did you just say “save me”!? Are you okaaaaay!?

A-Are you hurt somewhere!?

Ahhh!! Don’t worry!!! It’ll be fine! I’ll be by your side, no matter what! So there’s not a single thing to worry about, okay Akehoshi!?

{% endbubble %}
{% bubble Subaru worried %}
Shhh… Sorry, don’t make so much noise.

I kinda forgot I was still wearing the outfit for the Venus Cup, see…

Then like, I had a party with the guys I performed on stage with while still in this outfit…

Oh, but we only did it after we cheered Hidaka-kun on during the play after the Venus Cup.

But then, they pointed out that I’m still wearing this outfit, so I came back over to school for a sec—

I’m just borrowing this outfit, so I gotta make sure to return it, and like… They’ll make me pay if I tear or ruin it.

But, there was clamor all over the school—

And I guess you call them the producer of the Venus Cup…? But I couldn’t find the supervisor from the Student Council either…

I wasn’t sure what to do, so I peeked into the backstage…

That was when I saw this guy crouched down in a dark corner…

{% endbubble %}
{% bubble ChiakiPast %}
This guy…?

{% endbubble %}
{% bubble Shu distress %}
……

{% endbubble %}
{% bubble ChiakiPast %}
Ooh!? Is that… Itsuki Shu from Valkyrie!? The one who’s also part of the Five Eccentrics — the most promising people of our generation — like Shinkai-kun…?

{% endbubble %}
{% bubble Subaru worried %}
Mhm… and then like, I called out to him, thinking he was feeling ill…

But he didn’t respond back, and when I asked him if I should call for someone, he started screaming really loudly.

I really dunno what to do…

I think he doesn’t wanna be seen by anyone, so I tried to help him up while hiding him, and managed all the way up to this point—

But I mean, the whole school’s going about like nuts, right?

We’re stuck in crowds, so I think it’ll be hard to take him over to some place quiet without being seen… I’m really stuck with what to do now.

What do I do? What happened, anyway? He looks like the world is about to collapse…

{% endbubble %}
{% bubble ChiakiPast %}
I-I don’t know. After watching you onstage, I had to go to a part-time job, and left school for a bit.

But then I thought I should do some practice, so now I’m here again.

W-Well, no matter! Fear not, Akehoshi! I’ll bring over that laundry trolley for cleaning, and some sheets or maybe curtains!

We’ll hide Itsuki-kun like that and carry him off somewhere!

I-Is that good enough?

{% endbubble %}
{% bubble Subaru worried %}
I dunno… You should ask him, not me. I brought him all the way over here, but I don’t even know if that was the right thing to do or not.

{% endbubble %}
{% bubble ChiakiPast %}
Ahh, that’s true…? Heeey, Itsuki-kun…?

## Translation Notes
[^1]: It’s very likely they’re talking about [HiMERU](https://ensemble-stars.fandom.com/wiki/HiMERU).
[^2]: In Japan, number four on the basketball uniform signified the captain. You can read more on the numbers [here](https://chouseisan.com/l/post-52236/) (It's in Japanese).
[^3]: Chiaki has been referring to Subaru with *kimi* up until this point, when he switched to *omae*. Both mean “you”, but *omae* is more rough and informal than *kimi*, so it gives off a much more casual or close feel. But it can also be rude to refer to someone with *omae*, since it’s typically used towards someone below you, which may be the reason behind Subaru’s reaction.
[^4]: In the original, Subaru trails off before he elaborates, so it’s unclear whether he was asking a question or stating something. He was definitely going to follow up the sentence with a verb, so it’s possible that it was “Do you know anything about my dad?” or “Did you hear about my dad?” or something similar. It’s free for interpretation.
[^5]: As a fun fact, Chiaki uses the word *chuunibyou* here, and the gacha that came with this event was Chuunibyou.
[^6]: Chiaki uses the word *usohappyaku* 嘘八百 to say “lies and fabrication”, which share the same kanji used in *yaobikuni* 八百比丘尼.
[^7]: Originally, Kanata misunderstands and says *seire…i?*, as in spirit (精霊), because Shu says *seireen* for “siren”. I changed it to “psyche” to somewhat fit a similar pronunciation as “siren” in English.
[^8]: Apparently, [there was a muse that did come from the water, and sometimes they’re referred to as water nymphs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muses).
[^9]: This is an expression to say that even scary-looking people feel compassion, as well as being a reference to Kuro’s last name, as it has the kanji for “demon” (鬼).
[^10]: A reference to what happened in the flashback chapter in Gang (Chapter 3).
[^11]: Rogue in Japanese is *gorotsuki* ごろつき, which has various negative connotations, such as someone who loiters around with no fixed home or job of their own, or who takes advantage of people’s weakpoints, or threatens others with force.
[^12]: Souma is doing a *dogeza*.
[^13]: Souma’s family name 神崎 has the kanjis “God” and “cape (on the coast)”.
[^14]: ぶちょ～, a more drawn out way to say *buchou*, meaning “club captain”.
