chiaki~♪

i Sent the children back home. i only went up to the station for the Train, though.[^1]

i’ve completed my mission! will you praise me, chiaki? ♪

have i become a proper hero? just like you?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki %}
…Eeek!?

A-Ahh, yeah! Good work! You really are a reliable comrade, Kanata! I knew you’d be able to accomplish your duty safely! Fuhahaha! ☆
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata %}
…were you crying?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki %}
Huh!? No I wasn’t! Don’t say such absurd things, Kanata! You little~!! ☆
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata %}
…okay. heroes only shed Happy tears, yes?

fufu. you’ve become so amazing and wonderful…

even though when we first Met, you were always in Tears, Shaking in fear.

no… that hasn’t changed.

i was wondering why you wanted to Stay behind… so that was to avoid having the children see you Crying… is that it?

you always want to show off your cool side, even though you’re so easily embarrassed~♪

<th>(but, such a pitiful person still Saved me. i’ll never, ever forget… until the day this Ocean is completely dried up.)</th>
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki %}
Uuu… No, it’s just that it was already late in the night, so we had to take them home. Though, part of it *is* because I didn’t want them to see me cry…

Look here, Kanata. While cleaning, I found the old Ryuseitai uniforms we have never worn since then.

I couldn’t get myself to throw away the stuff my seniors left behind… we ended up adding new stuff on top of it, too, so the pile’s gotten really big in here now, but—

These uniforms were still buried deep inside. So many memories came flowing back into me when I saw them, so I felt like crying…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata %}
ahh… *that’s* why you were acting so Hyper earlier.

fufu. after that performance, we were skipping about, unable to perform any live shows…

so we wore our p.e. uniforms, and ran everywhere in order to Help anybody.

and that’s why you forgot all about these Uniforms, yes?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki %}
Yeah. I wanted us to have our own uniforms that suit us, instead of using the ones from our past legacy.

That’s why I asked Kiryu to make new ones after everything finally ended.

Ahh, it’s all coming back to me… All the old members of Ryuseitai quit after the Battle versus the Sea God.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata %}
yes. i was an eccentric joining ryuseitai, so they probably Didn’t want any Troubles that come with that.

even the old Leader left. and then, that title became yours.

fufu. and the rogue was Planning on joining a new Agency, so—

i found it very funny that he had Dropped out of school in secret before that live show.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki %}
Don’t laugh at that… Why are you only this harsh towards Mikejima-san… But it kind of feels like you have no restraint regarding him, like you somehow seem very close with him — it’s enough to make me feel a little jealous.

Heheh. Well, he quickly tried to retract his decision to drop out, but still left Ryuseitai anyway—

He must’ve had plans of his own or something, because he never returned to Ryuseitai after that.

He mainly worked overseas while jumping between different units.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata %}
yes… now that he works Overseas, it seems like he is considering trying to obtain his own Influence through it—

and then, he wants to destroy my family’s Religion for sure this time.

not that there’s any purpose… i lost many Worshippers at the battle versus the sea god. they have been essentially Annihilated.

once i Graduate and have enough Free time, i’ll Cooperate with Him—

and Remodel our religion into something that matches this Generation.

it will be hard, because the Religion has been going on for a long, long time. it may take some Time, but i’ll take Responsibility.

i’ll come back when i’m done. so please let me sing with you then, okay?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki %}
Mhm, I’ll be waiting for you. I’m always ready to welcome you back. …In fact, don’t hesitate to call for me if you’re ever in trouble.

I haven't decided my own path yet, either. I’m in a shoddy state at the moment, because I’ve barely taken responsibility for my future—

But I’ve gotten stronger, even if only by a little. I’ve been working hard to grow stronger without ever giving up.

I’ll save you, no matter what. And not only that — I’ll *always* be your ally.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata %}
i know that, chiaki…♪
{% endbubble %}

## Chapter 2

{% img /img/es/eventstory/meteorimpact/epilogue2.jpg %}

{% bubble Kanata %}
but… your path hasn’t been confirmed yet? i am surprised — so even you can be something of a Punk, huh?[^2]
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki %}
Punk? Like Kiryu? *Oh,* because I haven’t made any progress yet, right… Ahh, well — I think I made it a little too hard on myself.

I got greedy, you see. I couldn’t get myself to give up on any of my dreams, so I decided I’d make them *all* come true.

Well, Tenshouin said he’ll mediate for me, so hopefully everything will turn out alright.

I owe him a lot… Ryuseitai was able to live on thanks to him, too.

Last year, we couldn’t win a single DreamFes as a unit with an Eccentric member—

Ryuseitai was extremely close to dissolution, since we were practically broke in unit funds…

But Tenshouin started giving us work outside the school in secret, and we managed to keep the unit going.

Well, I get the feeling that he just pushed the tough community service that no one else wanted to do onto us, because he felt like *we’d* be able to enjoy them.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata %}
hm. well, maybe it was his Atonement for hurting us five Eccentrics.

i refuse to forgive him, though~ because he made my Friends suffer.

it is not about what happened to me — the real problem is that he got Involved with my Friends.

on the other hand, the temple guy is surprisingly not that Revolting.

i will not listen to what he Says ever again, though… by that, i mean his Wishes. it is all his fault that i could not stay as a god, after all.

as frustrating as it is, i suppose i could also say it is *thanks* to him.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki %}
Mhm. In retrospect, everything changed thanks to their revolution.

We’re now in a world where effort pays off. And we even have more good-natured, talented allies with the same ambition.

We were finally able to get five members, just like a typical superhero sentai squad — so knowing we’re going to have to graduate soon feels lonely, but…

As long as we don’t give up on our dreams, surely we’ll be able to come across each other anytime.

And the reason for that is! Heroes never ignore those calling for help! They’ll always come rushing if anyone ever needs them!

And the other reason is! Because we were able to become heroes…☆
{% endbubble %}

{% img /img/es/eventstory/meteorimpact/epilogue2_1.jpg %}

{% bubble Tetora %}
Ossu! Excuse me!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki %}
Woah, wha—!? Ooh, Nagumo! I didn’t even call for you, yet you came rushing over, huh!? You really do have what it takes to be a hero!

What’s up, what’s wrong!? Did you forget something!?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora %}
I’m not the only one who came back~ Look, we’re all here.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
Hello… I don’t think you called for me, but I came back anyway…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shinobu %}
So have I~! ♪

Nihihi~ You see, on our way home, Shinkai-dono told us about the past… He spoke in such a peculiar manner that there were many incomprehensible parts of the story—

But after collecting our thoughts, we decided to come back.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki %}
…You told them about the *past*? Kanata!?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata %}
yes, i did. i am sorry, chiaki. but i Exaggerated most of it, and kept what you wouldn’t want them to know a Secret.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
Ahh, so you *were* exaggerating things…

All that meteorite stuff, and how Morisawa-senpai *apparently* mega-exploded when he was in a pinch, and revived himself within the flames… It all sounded like a lie to me from the start…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata %}
i was not Lying\~ that’s chiaki’s Finishing move: “super phoenix explosion”\~♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
Well, I’m sure that part was nonsense, but… I get the part where he struggled through a *lot*…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora %}
Ossu! We felt like it wasn’t right of us to be the only ones going home, leaving Taichou behind when he’d been working hard all by himself ever since his first year…

So the three of us messaged each other and came right back here.

Though I do feel bad, since Shinkai-senpai went through all the trouble to take us home.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
I was planning on heading straight to bed, but… eh, my house is nearby, so it’s not that big of a deal…

I started feeling gloomy after everything that had happened, and couldn’t get myself to sleep, so—

My mind felt at ease when Tetora-kun called me…♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shinobu %}
Yes! We dashed straight over here!

It may be a no-no for us to stay up for so long, since it is important for idols to have their beauty sleep, but! It is a hundred times better than to regret doing nothing!

Now then! Let us combine our powers and finish cleaning this up~☆
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
Yep, leave it to me… I’m good at arranging things and packing them up…♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora %}
Ossu! I’m not good with that kinda stuff, but I’m great at anythin’ that needs hard labor! It’ll make for a nice workout, too\~♪
{% endbubble %}

{% img /img/es/eventstory/meteorimpact/epilogue2_2.jpg %}

{% bubble Chiaki %}
You guys… I see, I was such an idiot.

I don’t need to shoulder everything by myself… not anymore.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata %}
fufu. it is hard to let go of old Habits and outdated Customs. even i act like a god sometimes.

but, we have changed.

we have *transformed*. like this — this is No.1’s transformation pose…♪

you are the one who taught me this.

thank you, hero…♪

## Translation Notes

[^1]: Kanata originally says <em>densha no ko</em>, implying either Tetora or Shinobu go home by train.
[^2]: Originally, Kanata says <em>kurou</em> for “struggle”, and Chiaki thinks it’s Kuro’s name. To convey a similar feeling, Kanata says “punk” to mean “an inexperienced young person; a novice”. Thank you <a href="https://twitter.com/yoroshikilled" target="_blank">Peace</a> for the localization!
