{% bubble Shinobu grin %}
Morisawa-dono, look…! WILDLAND’s booming with business!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki smilesoft %}
Yeah, it seems that the event passing itself off as a new twist on Alice in Wonderland was tremendously effective.

The MV that utilized VR also got a lot of response since its release, so everyone’s efforts are truly proving to be fruitful.

And this means that all the people here are the Alices we’ll be guiding! ☆
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora norsmile2 %}
Yeah, the info related to the attractions and the collaborating idols is available to the public, but…

The actual events that’ll go down in WILDLAND haven’t been announced yet.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shinobu curious %}
Ah, Tetora-kun. You’re back already?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki norsmile %}
You went to check up on the stage where that lion’s performing, right? How was it on that side?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora norsmile %}
They all looked super eager to start. And it seems that even the lion got back all its energy thanks to Animal Trainer-san coming over.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata smile %}
ufufu. you know, the very moment [lion]-san caught sight of tetora, it immediately clung to him.

the makeup artist looked so [frantic] and [worried] that his outfit will get dirty~
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora smileconfident %}
Ahaha, yeah, I accidentally got the makeup artist all worried.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori norsmile %}
You’ve basically gotten used to handling that lion, haven’t you, Tetora-kun?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora smilesoft %}
Yeah. I kept bracing myself around it the first few times, but now, it just feels like a sorta big cat playing around with me.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori serious %}
I’m amazed you’re able to call a lion a “sorta big cat”.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki curious %}
But the most unexpected one was Takamine. I didn’t think he’d go meet the lion by himself. I could’ve sworn he said that he didn’t want to see any lions for now…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shinobu serious %}
Is the stage set still weighing on your mind, by any chance?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori idle %}
Ah, no, I’m fine with it by now. I <em>was</em> surprised when I first saw the stage, though.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora norsmile3 %}
Well, anyone would feel that way if they suddenly got taken from that wild land to this menacing stage.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shinobu norsmile2 %}
Indeed, since the project’s details only explained it as “having an ominous air”.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata grin %}
ufufu. all the first time visitors might feel surprised too, won’t they~?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki smileexplain %}
Yeah, but that surprise is likely meant to be part of WILDLAND’s concept.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora norsmile %}
Yeah. I went ‘round the other attractions and stages, and all of ‘em have different kinds of worlds…

Each and every one ‘em was like getting lost in an entirely new, unknown world.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shinobu smilesoft %}
It truly is exactly like Alice in Wonderland.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora smile %}
Ossu. I feel like I get why Alice in Wonderland is loved by so many people now.

<th>(An extraordinary feeling that you’d rarely get to experience in typical daily life… You feel anxious, but you’re also filled with anticipation, not knowing what could happen next—)</th>

<th>(A world that feels as though you’re having a strange dream… That’s what everyone feels charmed by, right?)</th>
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora northinking %}
<th>(In that case, our role as the Cheshire Cat is—)</th>
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora smileconfident %}
…Ah, it’s just ‘bout to be our turn. Is everyone ready?

We’ll take the hands of all the Alices wandering ‘bout — and guide ‘em~♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora grin %}
“—Ahaha! What a surprise to see this many people lose their way and wander into this world!”
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora norsmile2 %}
“What’s your name? And yours? …Actually, nah, you don’t have to answer that.”

“We give anyone who wanders into this strange world the same name — ‘Alice’.”
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora smileexplain %}
“Once again, as a reminder… This is WILDLAND — a place where the weak won’t be able to survive.”

“From here on out, Alice — all of you — will go on a journey within this world.”

“You’ll travel through this world, completely different from the one you were once in… this disordered world, with only distorted logic.”
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora smilesoft %}
“Fufu, did that scare you a li’l? But y’know, there’s no need to feel anxious.”

“In order to help you be able to stand against this world… We, the Cheshire Cat, are here.”
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora fist %}
“Come, listen closely to our voices. We’ll clear away your overflowing anxiety — and release that desire of yours that anticipates a whole new world!”

“♪\~♪\~♪”
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki norsmile %}
<th>(It looks like you’ve caught their attention perfectly, Nagumo.)</th>

<th>(For this project… It’s a given that Nagumo worked hard for the live show and MV, but he even made sure to practice his MC role at the same time.)</th>
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki smile %}
<th>(And it doesn’t stop there, either. Based on what I’ve heard from Kanata, he also had several discussions about the production and choreography with the staff.)</th>

<th>(The reason that we can shine this bright on this stage today is none other than you and your efforts — For leading Ryuseitai as the commander.)</th>

<th>(I joined practice midway, so I can’t afford to hold everyone back… I have to make sure I live up to Nagumo’s efforts and wishes, too!)</th>

“~♪”

{% bubble Midori serious %}
<th>(Lightweight moves like the Cheshire Cat… and then add variation to the movements to bring out a wild feel… is what I think Tetora-kun said?)</th>

<th>(The way Tetora-kun poured all his efforts even when facing something he had no interest in… I really think that part about him is just amazing.)</th>
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori curious %}
<th>(Um, we’re about to reach the part before the hook, where we all have to synchronize our movements… I have to be sure I don’t fall behind…)</th>

<th>(Tetora-kun changed this part ‘cause he trusted that Shinobu-kun and I could do it. I can’t afford to ruin all that hard work.)</th>
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori norsmile2 %}
<th>(It’ll be alright. It went well during rehearsal, so — One, two, three…!)</th>
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori grin %}
“~♪”

<th>(…Mhm~♪ Everyone’s timing was perfect for this part!)</th>
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shinobu smilesoft %}
<th>(Like Shinkai-dono said, it was a difficult area for all of us to match in rhythm, but—)</th>

<th>(Look how well we’ve done with enough practice! With our combined efforts, we made the composition look so cool!)</th>

{% bubble Shinobu wldbcg %}
<th>(What do you think, Tetora-kun? Is the performance turning out how you envisioned it in your head?)</th>

<th>(I, for one, can say it with full confidence…! Ryuseitai is undoubtedly wild-like right now~♪)</th>

“♪\~♪\~”
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata smilesoft2 %}
<th>(you look so happy, shinobu.)</th>

<th>(i already knew that the three of them could do it with how they are now, so i was not particularly [worried]…)</th>

<th>(but i am still surprised, as they [grasped] the movements much faster than i imagined.)</th>
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata norsmile %}
<th>(one of the reasons why is because the children have [grown] since those days of the past, but…)</th>

<th>(most of all, tetora led everyone for this project. that must be the true reason why we were able to reach this level of [perfection].)</th>
{% endbubble %}

<th>(ufufu, if we keep standing around doing nothing, we might get overtaken before we know it, chiaki~♪)</th>

“…~♪”
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora smilesoft %}
<th>(Everyone’s amazing as always. Their movements now are even sharper than they were during rehearsal.)</th>

<th>(…At first, I didn’t understand anything ‘bout Alice in Wonderland, nor ‘bout the concept of ‘wild’, but…)</th>

<th>(I still plunged myself into this project, going as far as I can while believing in the image of WILDLAND I had in my head.)</th>
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora smileconfident %}
<th>(Whether I was right or wrong in my choices… That’s pretty easy to tell just by lookin’ at all the guests’ faces~♪)</th>

<th>(The “Wild-like Ryuseitai” challenge is a huge success! We’re shining at our ever brightest right now!)</th>

“Now then, Alice! With your high hopes towards a whole new world, try taking one step forward!”

“Because beyond this point — There’s surely an irreplaceable encounter waiting for you~♪”[^1]

…………
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora smilesoft %}
<th>(…Aight, my focus is on point.)</th>

<th>(I was thinking a whole lot ‘bout WILDLAND up ‘til recently, so now that the event’s settled, I feel like I finally got a weight off my back.)</th>
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora fist %}
<th>(It’s been a while since I’ve been to the club, so I’m gonna go all out~♪)</th>

<th>(Mm…? Who’s that over there…?)</th>

 *<th>(waves)</th>* Heeey~! What’re you doing here?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Junior %}
Ah, hello. I hope you’re doing well, Nagumo-senpai.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora smileconfident %}
Ossu! You could’ve greeted me if you were here, y’know?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Junior %}
Ah, no, I didn’t want to interrupt you while you were concentrating…

Also, I have unit practice after this, so I can’t participate in Karate Club activities today…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora norsmile %}
Ahh, I see!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora northinking %}
…? Then why didja come to the dojo? Are you here to pick up somethin’ you forgot?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Junior %}
Ah, no, I just had something I wanted to tell you, Senpai…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora curious %}
Somethin’ to tell me…?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Junior %}
Um… The WILDLAND live stage was absolutely *incredible!*
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora smile %}
Ahaha. So you really <em>did</em> come and see us. I felt like I recognized someone I know in the crowd.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Junior %}
…! You noticed I was there, Nagumo-senpai?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora grin %}
Bein’ attentive to every single corner of the venue is an essential skill as an idol~♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Junior %}
Ossu…! I’ll engrave your words in my heart, Senpai… Ah, wait, we were talking about Nagumo-senpai’s performance!

Even though Ryuseitai’s a unit I know well, the song you were all singing felt like something I’ve never seen before…

It made me realize there’s still a Ryuseitai I wasn’t aware of yet, or rather… I was just so surprised by the performance, like…!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora nod %}
……♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Junior %}
I’m so sorry. I can’t get the words out right. But it was really, <em>really</em> amazing. I just badly wanted to let you know that…!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora smilesoft %}
No worries. Your feelings are getting across just fine.

Thank you. I really appreciate you coming to see our Ryuseitai live show.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Junior %}
Ah, no! I’m the one who got so much courage from you again, Senpai.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora curious %}
Courage?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Junior %}
…The truth is, I was feeling a little depressed about today’s unit practice. The rest of the first years had already joined their own units and started practicing back in April, unlike me…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora smileconfident %}
Ahh~ It’s June by now, yeah. It must be nerve-wracking joining a unit so late.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Junior %}
But after I saw Senpai’s stage with Ryuseitai, I felt more prepared to participate in my unit’s activities.

…It made me decide that, no matter how anxious I feel, I have to first try jumping in that whole new world. ‘Cause if I don’t try and do something, I’ll never <em>ever</em> be able to become like Senpai.[^2]
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora smile %}
Ahaha! Nothin’ makes me happier than knowing you feel that way!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora srsthinking %}
…………
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Junior %}
That’s all I wanted to say, so… I’ll head over to practice now.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora serious %}
Actually, I’d like you to wait a moment.

Could you hear me out a li’l?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Junior %}
……?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora frown %}
See, I get a lotta support from many fans as a member of Ryuseitai nowadays, but…

I didn’t start out as such a respectable guy at *all.*
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora sighfrown %}
In fact, when I first joined Ryuseitai, all I’d do is complain ‘bout our unit activities. I’d always whine and say it wasn’t what I wanted to do—

I didn’t really understand my seniors, and I wasn’t aligned with the other members, either.

You say that I’m your goal, but actually, my starting point as an idol didn’t go smoothly at all. I had a lot more failures than anythin’ else.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Junior %}
…………
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora awkward %}
…Sorry. This prolly doesn’t make much sense, huh?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora norsmile2 %}
Basically, what I wanna say is… I was anxious at first, too.

Things didn’t always go the way I hoped. There was just as much stuff I wasn’t satisfied with.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora smilesoft %}
But even then, the reason that I’ve been able to remain as Ryuseitai’s Ryusei Black — It’s all ‘cuz my comrades in the unit were here with me.

It’s ‘cuz I had my seniors who would guide me. I had my companions who would support me as much as I support ‘em. That’s why I can shine so bright right now.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora smileexplain %}
It’s true that the me who once wanted to join Akatsuki will remain a part of who I am… But—

In the new world that I stepped into — in Ryuseitai, I saw something shinin’ within it, too.

That’s why… I’m glad that I get to be part of Ryuseitai. I just wanted to make this part clear.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora smileconfident %}
You said that you finally found a unit that feels like a group you want to join, right?

I’m sure you also felt somethin’ shining within that unit, right?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Junior %}
*…<th>(Nods)</th>*
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora fist %}
Then you’ll be just fine! Just believe in your instincts and push your way through!

There may be moments when your opinions don’t align with the other members, and maybe you’ll even end up in arguments ‘cuz of it, but…

That only happens ‘cuz you’re all different people. By clashing against each other and learning more ‘bout each others’ different mindsets and beliefs, it’ll eventually become a huge source of motivation for you.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora grin %}
It’s fine to fail or make mistakes. If you fall down, just stand back up~♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Junior %}
…Thank you very much, Nagumo-senpai.

I’ll try and do my best. I’ll practice a whole lot, and then someday… I’ll become a cool idol like Senpai![^2]
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora fist %}
Ossu! Keep up the spirit and do your best~!
{% endbubble %}

<div class="msr-narration">
    <p>Sound of footsteps</p>
</div>

{% bubble Tetora smile %}
…Whew. I feel so much better now that I said everythin’ I wanted to say.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora northinking %}
But maybe I acted as a senior a little <em>too</em> much…?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shinobu smilesoft %}
I don’t think so at all~♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora surprised %}
Woah!? Shinobu-kun, since when were you here!?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori idle %}
You really are amazing, Tetora-kun. I’d *never* be able to give advice to a junior like that…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora shocked %}
Midori-kun too…!? How long have you guys been watchin’!?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shinobu smileexplain %}
Since you said, “Could you hear me out a li’l?” to him.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora blushsurprised %}
That’s practically all’a it…! This is <em>so</em> embarrassing…!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shinobu grin %}
There is nothing to be embarrassed about~ You were <em>such</em> a cool upperclassman!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shinobu norsmile2 %}
I hope that in time, that kid becomes a wonderful idol.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora norsmile %}
…He will, I’m sure of it.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori serious %}
Well, I’m heading home. I only happened to be here ‘cause Shinobu-kun called out to me while I was on my way back.
{% endbubble %}

{% img https://f005.backblazeb2.com/file/reitoouji/ro_r6731436aPRzEw51.webp?timestamp=1731281777250 %}

{% bubble Shinobu norsmile %}
Wait a moment, Midori-kun! If you don’t have any club activities, I’d like you to help me with student council work.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori worried0 %}
Eh, that sounds like such a pain… The fact that it’s student council work just makes it worse, too…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shinobu grin %}
It won’t be that much of a pain, so! Please do me a favor~!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora smileconfident %}
Ahaha, even when we’re in the highest year in school, you two are the same as always.

## Translation Notes

[^1]: Tetora’s lines here align beautifully with the lyrics of WILDLAND, please give <a href="/WILDLAND_SURVIVOR" target="_blank">the lyrics a read</a>!
[^2]: Here, Tetora’s junior says <em>-ssu</em> in hiragana, similar to how Tetora ends his lines with <em>-ssu</em> in katakana.
