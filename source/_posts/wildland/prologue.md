Whoa—…!

<th>(The wind’s super strong… I’m real glad Shinobu-kun firmly secured me in place.)</th>

<th>(I’m well-aware I’m doing somethin’ crazy right now… But I’ve already made up my mind.)</th>
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori worried %}
Tetora-kun, I really think we should give up on that plan! You don’t need to push yourself this much, seriously!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora angry %}
I can’t do that now! There are people waiting for rescue in this wild land as we speak!
{% endbubble %}

<th>(…Yeah, exactly. We’re Ryuseitai. We’re heroes who rush over to anyone in trouble!)</th>

<th>(We’ll zip through this wild land at full speed, you’ll see!)</th>
{% endbubble %}

<div class="msr-narration">
    <p>Several weeks earlier, at the dojo…</p>
</div>

{% bubble Tetora nod %}
—Aight. Let’s take a fifteen-minute break, guys. Once it’s over, we’ll get back to doing our <em>kumite</em> training![^1]

<th>(Maybe it’s ‘cuz there’s a lotta kids participating in the club today, but I feel like I’m on fire with our activities~♪)</th>

<th>(This should be a good experience for all the first year newcomers too, since having so many members means they get to do <em>kumite</em> against all sortsa opponents.)</th>

{% bubble Hiiro smileexplain %}
Here’s a fill of water for you, Buchou.[^2]
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora smileconfident %}
Ah, Hiiro-kun! Thanks a bunch!

*Gulp, gulp…* Whew—! Nothing feels better than drinkin’ water after moving your body, huh?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Hiiro grin %}
Fufu. You seem more enthusiastic than usual, Buchou.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora grin %}
Ahaha, is it that easy to tell?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Hiiro %}
Yes. Your vigor when doing <em>kumite</em> is a given, but you were also giving out the instructions to everyone with the same level of spirit.

Did something good happen, by any chance?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora smilesoft %}
Nah, it’s nothin’ big. I’m just happy to see so many members ‘round in the club today.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Hiiro curious %}
Oh yes, that’s true. Maybe they didn’t have anything scheduled today?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora northinking %}
Hm, yeah, this is the time when it’s normal to start preppin’ a regular schedule for unit practice…

But then again, not everyone is part of a unit as of this moment.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Hiiro curious %}
…………
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora idle %}
Mm? What’s wrong, Hiiro-kun?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Hiiro serious %}
Maybe it’s just my imagination, but that boy over there seems to want to speak to you…?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora norsmile %}
That boy…? Ahh, he’s a first year kid that joined the club this year.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Hiiro norsmile %}
I remember him well. He’s a big fan of yours, isn’t he? On the very day he joined the club, he said that he enrolled in Yumenosaki Academy because he watched Buchou’s live show.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora awkward0 %}
Ahaha. Yeah, he immediately told me, “I admire you, Senpai! I want to be a manly idol just like you!” with the club application paper in his hands.

I’m used to bein’ supported by fans, but being told ‘bout it so directly makes me feel a li’l embarrassed.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Hiiro smilesoft2 %}
But you know, I really understand how he feels. From what I’ve heard, the very first idol he ever saw was you, Buchou.

……It’s simply impossible to forget something as impactful as the very first time you see an idol.[^3]
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora yare %}
…That’s exactly why I know I did somethin’ awful to him.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Hiiro idle %}
Ermm, he was hoping to join Ryuseitai, correct?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora frown %}
Yeah. But a bunch’a things happened, and Ryuseitai-N is no more now.[^4]

He was so honest with me, saying he wanted to become an idol after watching me — But I feel like I completely killed his enthusiasm mentionin’ that…
{% endbubble %}

<div class="msr-narration">
    <p>Sound of footsteps</p>
</div>

{% bubble Junior %}
I’m very sorry for interrupting. Nagumo-senpai, may I have a bit of your time?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora curious %}
Erm, is somethin’ the matter?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Hiiro curious %}
…Is it best that I leave?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Junior %}
Ah, no. It’s not such a serious matter, so please don’t worry!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora norsmile %}
Erm, so what’s up?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Junior %}
I just wanted to let you know that I may not be able to come to the Karate Club as much from now on, Senpai.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora shocked %}
You won’t be able to join practice? D-Did something’ happen!?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Junior %}
Um, I’m also trying to join a unit, so…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora smile %}
Ahh, I get it now. So that’s why.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Hiiro norsmile2 %}
In other words, you’ll have unit practice, so you may not be able to show up as often in the club, correct?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Junior %}
Yes. I’d love to participate in the Karate Club’s activities every day as well if I could, but…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora smileconfident %}
Don’t worry ‘bout it! It’s good enough that you’re coming whenever you can.

I also have work and practice with Ryuseitai, so I won’t always be here either.

But I’m happy to know you’re enjoying our club activities that much~♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Hiiro %}
*<th>(whispering)</th>* Buchou. I believe that he looks forward to doing karate with you, rather than enjoys karate practice itself.

*<th>(whispering)</th>* After all, Buchou is the idol he admires.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora awkward0 %}
*<th>(whispering)</th>* Ah— Right…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora smileexplain %}
Erm, even if you can’t come to the Karate Club as much anymore, you’re always welcome to talk to me any time you need me!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Junior %}
…Is that really alright? Aren’t you busy with all sorts of things, Nagumo-senpai…?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora nod %}
It’s all good! I don’t wanna be a senior who can’t even make the time to hear out his juniors. Feel free to ask me anything!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Junior %}
…Anything…

In that case, Senpai, I do have a question in mind…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora norsmile2 %}
Sure, go ahead and ask away!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Junior %}
…Nagumo-senpai, is it true that you tried to join Akatsuki at first?

Erm, I heard about it from the other seniors…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora serious %}
It’s true.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora frown %}
There’s a senior in Akatsuki that I admire, but I ended up failing the unit’s entrance exam, as embarrassing as it is to admit.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Junior %}
Ah, I—… see. So you didn’t choose Ryuseitai from the very start…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora norsmile %}
Ah, but don’t get the wrong idea! I don’t regret joinin’ Ryuseitai.

It’s true that when I first joined Ryuseitai, there were a buncha things that made me feel antsy or that I kept debatin’ over…

But it’s ‘cuz of my seniors and comrades in Ryuseitai that I’m the person I am today!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Junior %}
…I see. I’m glad I got to learn about that.

Ever since I found out I can’t join Ryuseitai, I was debating on what to do…

But I knew it wouldn’t be good to stay on my own forever, so I looked around for another unit I might find interest in.

The only thing is, that feeling of wishing I could’ve joined Ryuseitai hasn’t faded…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora serious %}
…That—
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Junior %}
But, now that I know that Nagumo-senpai went through a similar experience, I feel fired up somehow.

I’ll try it out. Just like Nagumo-senpai — I’ll do my best to shine in a unit I didn’t want to be in!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora shocked %}
…Huh?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Junior %}
Thank you very much for answering my question, Nagumo-senpai.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora surprised %}
Ah— W-Wait…!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora sighfrown %}
<th>(I feel like I gave him the wrong idea entirely…)</th>

<th>(He’s kinda got a point… When I first joined Ryuseitai, I got fed up with the kinda activities we’d do in the unit—)</th>

<th>(I had thought that Ryuseitai was a manly unit, one that saves the weak and crushes the strong — that they were allies of justice…)</th>

<th>(But the reality wasn’t like that at <em>all</em>…)</th>

<th>(It was a unit that did nothin’ but play superheroes — to the point that I believed, “there has gotta be a much more suitable place for me than here”…)</th>[^5]
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora serious %}
<th>(…But as I kept doin’ activities in the unit, I learned ‘bout Morisawa-senpai’s desires, and felt somethin’ shining within the unit called “Ryuseitai”… I really mean that.)</th>[^6]

<th>(A unit I didn’t wanna be in… Maybe he’s kinda got a point sayin’ that, but—)</th>
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Hiiro curious %}
Buchou? What’s wrong?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora awkward0 %}
…Nah, it’s nothin’.

## Translation Notes

[^1]: Kumite is one of the ways to train in karate, involving sparring with someone else. Read more <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kumite" target="_blank">here</a>.
[^2]: “Buchou” means club captain/president.
[^3]: Referring to Hiiro’s first encounter with an idol, and how much it meant to him. This is explored in the first !! Era main story, as well as Matrix. For translations: Main story <a href="https://mainstoryarchive.tumblr.com/post/759278638269169664/translation-main-story-archive-masterlist" target="_blank">here</a>, Matrix <a href="https://toujokaname.tumblr.com/post/750764512860422144/matrix" target="_blank">here</a>.
[^4]: Referring to the events that took place across the first year of !! Era (ES1) for Ryuseitai; the agency ordered them to disband Ryuseitai-N. For a summary, please <a href="/dokisuta_ryuseitai" target="_blank">see the Ryuseitai timeline provided by the Dokisuta stream</a>. To learn more about what happened, please read the ES1 Ryuseitai stories, such as <a href="/comet_show" target="_blank">Comet Show</a>, <a href="/supervillain" target="_blank">Supervillain</a>, etc…
[^5]: Referring to Hero Show, when Tetora fled out of the room after getting tired of Ryuseitai’s activities. Hero Show is set in the early days of Ryuseitai’s Yumenosaki days, when they would mainly play superheroes or do hero shows as part of their activities. Another example of this is in <a href="/hero_game" target="_blank">Hero Game</a>.
[^6]: Referring to Supernova, the performance that kickstarted Ryuseitai from only doing hero shows, to being proper hero idols and getting proper idol work.
