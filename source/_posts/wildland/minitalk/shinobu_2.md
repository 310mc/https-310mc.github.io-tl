{% bubble Shinobu smileconfident %}
Ah, they are having an outdoors bouldering course designed for children!

Anzu-dono, have you ever tried bouldering before?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shinobu grin %}
I went to a bouldering place with Morisawa-dono and Tetora-kun just a little while ago. It was a lot of fun!
{% endbubble %}

<div class="minitalk" character="Anzu">
    <div class="minitalk-option">
        <div class="minitalk-option_header">
            It seems hard.
        </div>
        <div class="minitalk-option_content">
            {% bubble Shinobu smileexplain %}
            If you try the beginner’s course, I think you would be able to climb up with relative ease.

            I excel at wall-climbing, while Morisawa-dono and Tetora-kun are used to moving their bodies a lot, so we took on an advanced course.
            {% endbubble %}
            {% bubble Shinobu smilesoft %}
            The more difficult it is, the more exhilirating it feels when you complete the climb~♪

    <div class="minitalk-option">
        <div class="minitalk-option_header">
            I feel like you’d all be good at it.
        </div>
        <div class="minitalk-option_content">
            {% bubble Shinobu smile %}
            Ahaha. As you thought, we were all able to climb up the rocks easily.

            It was a lot of fun, so I also invited Midori-kun and Shinkai-dono to come with us next time.
            {% endbubble %}
            {% bubble Shinobu awkward %}
            But… Midori-kun wouldn’t look me in the eye when I asked, and Shinkai-dono went off to soak in water, so I didn’t get a good response from either of them…

{% bubble Shinobu smile %}
Morisawa-dono, Tetora-kun and I all managed to climb up with ease, so the staff praised us for our skills.

They even invited us to join a small upcoming competition.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shinobu northinking %}
We declined because we already have a job then, but… I’d love to participate in one someday.
{% endbubble %}

            Shall I come up with a proposal for it?

        <div class="minitalk-option_content">
            {% bubble Shinobu curious %}
            You’ll make a program proposal where we challenge ourselves to a bouldering competition…?
            {% endbubble %}
            {% bubble Shinobu worried %}
            No, no, you don’t have to go that far! My skills aren’t up to par to have a whole program made for it…
            {% endbubble %}
            {% bubble Shinobu fist %}
            But it does sound like fun. If I improve a little more, I’d like to challenge myself with that sort of program, as well!

    <div class="minitalk-option">

            {% bubble Shinobu smileconfident %}
            You’d come watch the competition too, Anzu-dono? That makes me happy!

            If I ever appear in a competition, I’d like Mayoi-dono and Isara-dono to watch it, too~
            {% endbubble %}
            {% bubble Shinobu grin %}
            Haha, that’s just my own daydreams, though. Just imagining it is enough excitement for me…♪

{% bubble Shinobu curious %}
Huh? That child… It seems they’re struggling to climb up the wall.

A staff member is helping them, but it seems to me that they can’t get a grasp of the feeling exactly.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shinobu northinking %}
I had also gotten stuck in a similar spot once upon a time. I might be able to assist them somehow…
{% endbubble %}

<div class="minitalk" character="Anzu">
    <div class="minitalk-option">
        <div class="minitalk-option_header">
          How about talking to them?
        </div>
        <div class="minitalk-option_content">
            {% bubble Shinobu srsthinking %}
            Mm~ I’m not so sure about walking over and talking to them when there’s a professional staff member around…

            This is a bit troubling… Hm, I wonder if it’d be alright to at least cheer the child on?
            {% endbubble %}
            {% bubble Shinobu smile %}
            I’ll head on over! You have my gratitude, Anzu-dono!

    <div class="minitalk-option">
        <div class="minitalk-option_header">
            Would you like to go there together?

        <div class="minitalk-option_content">
            {% bubble Shinobu curious %}
            You’ll come with me to where the child is at?
            {% endbubble %}
            {% bubble Shinobu smilesoft %}
            Fufu, you’re so reliable, Anzu-dono. I’d certainly love you to come with me.

            I’ll try to chip in a word or two without disturbing the staff member…!
