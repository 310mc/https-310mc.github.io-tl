—No, you don’t need’a thank me at all! Okay, see ya!

Ah— Anego! Fancy meeting ya at the train station.

Ah, you’re wonderin’ what that was about just now? I gave my seat to someone at the train, and they were thankin’ me for it.

            When an injured person is right before your eyes, it’s only natural to give your seat to ‘em!

            But seeing other people ‘round me also try to offer their seat made me kinda happy~♪

            It just goes to show that everyone holds a heroic heart in ‘em, no matter the person!

            Hehe, gettin’ praise from you makes me happy, Anego! But I didn’t do anythin’ worthy of a reward, y’know?

            Your feelings alone brightened my day by a lot. Thank you very much!

{% bubble Tetora northinking %}
The way to give your seat to someone on a train can be pretty tricky, huh?

Even I end up thinking stuff like, "Will they think I’m treating ‘em like an eldery? Won’t it be rude?"
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora awkward %}
Like, Midori-kun especially gets real worried ‘bout that sort of thing, it seems. I think it’s fine if he thinks ‘bout things a li’l more casually, though…
{% endbubble %}

            I kinda get it.

            {% bubble Tetora curious %}
            Ah, are you also the type to worry a bunch ‘bout this, Anego?

            When you’re the type of person who puts themself in another person’s shoes and imagines how they feel, you’re more likely to worry over this stuff, huh~?
            {% endbubble %}
            {% bubble Tetora norsmile %}
            On that point, someone like Isara-senpai seems like the type who’d be real good at handling these sorta situations.

            Casually calling out to them is the way to go, isn’t it?

        <div class="minitalk-option_content">
            {% bubble Tetora norsmile2 %}
            Ah— Are you the type who likes to casually call out to the person?

            Yeah, there’s a chance that the person’s strugglin’, so it’s better to call out immediately, right?
            {% endbubble %}
            {% bubble Tetora smilesoft %}
            I’ll try tellin’ Midori-kun the same thing next time. If I tell him that it’s your words, it’ll definitely get through to him~♪

{% bubble Tetora smileexplain %}
Ah, right! There’s apparently an overseas ingredients fair at a building near the station.

Aniki told me ‘bout it when I met him at the dorms.[^1] I’m pretty interested, so I’m plannin’ to take a look before I head back to the dorms.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora grin %}
You came here for the fair, Anego? Then I’d love to go together with ya~♪

            I haven’t decided on anythin’ specific, actually. I’m just thinkin’ of looking ‘round and picking stuff that way.
            {% endbubble %}
            {% bubble Tetora fist %}
            But since I always get the urge to buy unusual ingredients or seasonings when I see ‘em, I made sure to set a budget for myself!

            This way, I should be able to buy the right things without wasting money!

            I wonder what sort of ingredients they have.

            {% bubble Tetora smilesoft %}
            Aniki let me see what he bought, and there really is all sortsa things there!

            There’s a vegetable called “ghost plant”, a sweetener called “palm sugar”…
            {% endbubble %}
            {% bubble Tetora nod %}
            Japanese ingredients are great of course, but it’s fun to look at ingredients you don’t usually see, too~♪
