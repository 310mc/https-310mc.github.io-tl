{% bubble Chiaki smileconfident %}
Anzu, look over here! There’s an adorable cat.

It doesn’t run away even when I get close to it, and it sits still and lets me pet it!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki nod %}
Like this, there, there… <th><em>(pat, pat)</em></th> ♪ What a good kitty.
{% endbubble %}

<div class="minitalk" character="Anzu">
    <div class="minitalk-option">

            What a friendly cat.
        </div>
        <div class="minitalk-option_content">
            {% bubble Chiaki smile %}
            Yeah. It isn’t afraid of people at all — if anything, it looks so happy with all the petting.

            My tired mind feels healed from all the exhausting work…♪
            {% endbubble %}
            {% bubble Chiaki northinking %}
            Considering its behavior, maybe this cat is being taken care of as a pet somewhere?

            Mhm, it’s so tiny and just adorable!
            {% endbubble %}
            {% bubble Chiaki smileexplain %}
            Also, when I pet it like this, the cat seems to look as though its smiling. Look…♪

            Fufu, isn’t it so cute?

{% bubble Chiaki norsmile2 %}
Anzu, you may not believe me when I say this, but this cat can speak human language.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki curious %}
Just before you came, it was trying its best to talk to me… Mm?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki smilesoft %}
…Like now, didn’t it just talk!? Did you hear it, Anzu?
{% endbubble %}

<div class="minitalk" character="Anzu">

        <div class="minitalk-option_header">
            Could it be…

        <div class="minitalk-option_content">
            {% bubble Chiaki fist %}
            Yeah. There’s no doubt about it; it definitely said “Good morning”!

            Since you also heard it, then it must mean I didn’t mishear.
            {% endbubble %}
            {% bubble Chiaki northinking %}
            Can it say any other words too, I wonder…?

        <div class="minitalk-option_header">
            I feel like it’s just the usual meowing…

            No way, you can’t tell me that! Here, listen more closely!

            {% endbubble %}
            {% bubble Chiaki srsthinking %}
            That’s strange. I definitely heard it say “Good morning” just a moment ago…

{% bubble Chiaki norsmile %}
…Anzu, have you noticed? It seems like there’s another cat that’s a little farther from here, and it’s staring at us.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki curious %}
Is it curious about what’s going on here? But it might be too nervous to get closer…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki smile %}
Alright then, that means we should go and greet it ourselves! Let’s go, Anzu!
{% endbubble %}

<div class="minitalk" character="Anzu">
    <div class="minitalk-option">
        <div class="minitalk-option_header">
            You’ll scare it.

        <div class="minitalk-option_content">
            {% bubble Chiaki surprised %}
            Ah—…! It ran away because of my voice just now.
            {% endbubble %}
            {% bubble Chiaki frustrated %}
            I accidentally scared it away, just like you said would happen, Anzu… That was awful of me.
            {% endbubble %}
            {% bubble Chiaki sighdrop %}
            Will I get to see it if I come by this pathway again…? If I ever do, I want to apologize for what I did today.
			{% endbubble %}
        </div>
    </div>
    <div class="minitalk-option">
        <div class="minitalk-option_header">
            We have to be careful at times like this…
        </div>
        <div class="minitalk-option_content">
            {% bubble Chiaki srsthinking %}
            Mm, you’re right; we have to take careful action, or we’ll just frighten it.

            Mm~ This somehow feels similar to the feeling I get when I strike up a conversation with Takamine.
            {% endbubble %}
            {% bubble Chiaki awkward %}
            Er, actually, he’ll just get angry with me if I group him with a cat. Anzu, please keep what I just said a secret!
