{% bubble Tetora nod %}
Hehe. It’s as you said, Anego — The design on those trousers are pretty nice too!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora smileconfident %}
A junior from the Karate Club told me ‘bout this sports equipment site. They sell a lotta good products, huh~

Sports stuff quickly wear out, so the more good shops and sites I can look through, the better~♪

            This T-shirt might suit you.

            The black T-shirt, huh? Yeah, it’s nice ‘cuz it’s black, and looks pretty stylish at that too.
            {% endbubble %}
            {% bubble Tetora fist %}
            Aight, I’m gonna buy this T-shirt!
            {% endbubble %}
            {% bubble Tetora grin %}
            ‘Course it’s gonna be good, it’s something *Anego* recommends! I trust your choices~♪

            How about this towel?

        <div class="minitalk-option_content">
            {% bubble Tetora smilesoft %}
            Ahh, the towel with a yuruchara printed on it, right?

            It’s cute, but I think Midori-kun would like that sorta design more.

            I’ll order this for him while I’m orderin’ other stuff, too. And then I’ll give it to Midori-kun as a present the next time I see him!

{% bubble Tetora norsmile2 %}
On my next day off, I’m plannin’ on checking out a physical store with Hiiro-kun.

When I told Narukami-senpai and HiMERU-san ‘bout it, they told me that if I send ‘em a photo, they’ll check if it looks stylish or not.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora awkward %}
But to be honest, I’m not that concerned ‘bout whether or not my sports clothes look stylish…
{% endbubble %}

<div class="minitalk" character="Anzu">
    <div class="minitalk-option">
        <div class="minitalk-option_header">
            Sounds like it’ll be informative.

        <div class="minitalk-option_content">
            {% bubble Tetora srsthinking %}
            True, it’s a luxury that I can get advice from ‘em, since they’re both fashionable people.

            Uu~myu. I didn’t wanna take up their time, so I didn’t plan on contacting ‘em, but…
            {% endbubble %}
            {% bubble Tetora smile %}
            Aight, I think I’ll rely on ‘em just a li’l after all!

    <div class="minitalk-option">

            Daily efforts are important, after all.

        <div class="minitalk-option_content">
            {% bubble Tetora smilesoft %}
            As in, building up on your hard work every day is important, whether for karate or fashion, right?

            There’s no harm in being fashionable as someone who works a job that involves being in public, and it’s a great opportunity to get advice ‘bout it, so I’ll ask ‘em.
            {% endbubble %}
            {% bubble Tetora smileconfident %}
            If I get to buy somethin’ good, I’ll be sure to show ya too, Anego~♪

{% bubble Tetora curious %}
Ah— Shinobu-kun messaged me…? I’ll have to excuse myself for a moment.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora norsmile %}
Aight, it was just a reminder that Ryuseitai’s having a gathering soon.

We’ve all been busy lately, after all. So it looks like he went through the effort of sending me a reminder!

            {% bubble Tetora curious %}
            This is… a box of sweets?

            A staff member bought it as an apology, but nobody is using the box now? You sure it’s alright I take this…?
            {% endbubble %}
            {% bubble Tetora grin %}
            Got it! Then I’d be glad to take it! I’ll happily eat it along with everyone in Ryuseitai!

            Ah, we’re gonna go have lunch together today!

            Morisawa-senpai found a restaurant with tasty food, so he invited us to join him ‘cuz he wanted to go with everyone.
            {% endbubble %}
            {% bubble Tetora fist %}
            That’s why I skipped breakfast today, so I could enjoy my meal even more! I’m lookin’ forward to it!
