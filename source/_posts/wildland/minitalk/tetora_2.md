{% bubble Tetora nod %}
Hehe. It’s as you said, Anego — The design on those trousers are pretty nice too!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora smileconfident %}
A junior from Karate Club told me about this sports equipment site. They sell a lotta good products, huh~

It doesn’t take long to use up sports stuff, so the more good shops and sites I can check through, the better~♪

            This black T-shirt, huh? It works ‘cuz it’s black, and not to mention, looks pretty stylish too.
            {% endbubble %}
            {% bubble Tetora fist %}
            Aight, I’m gonna buy this T-shirt!
            {% endbubble %}
            {% bubble Tetora grin %}
            It’s something *Anego* recommends, so ‘course it’s gonna be good. I trust your choices~♪

            How about this towel?

            {% bubble Tetora smilesoft %}
            Ahh, the towel with a yuruchara printed on it, right?

            It’s cute, but I think Midori-kun would like that sorta design more.

            While I’m orderin’ other stuff, I’ll order this for him too. And then I’ll give it to Midori-kun as a present next time I see him!

On my next day off, I’m plannin’ on checking out a physical store with Hiiro-kun.

When I told Narukami-senpai and HiMERU-san ‘bout it, they told me that if I send ‘em a photo, they’ll check if it’s a stylish look or not.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora awkward %}
But to be honest, I’m not that concerned ‘bout whether or not my sports clothes look stylish…

    <div class="minitalk-option">
        <div class="minitalk-option_header">
            Sounds like it’ll be informative.

            {% bubble Tetora srsthinking %}
            Oh yeah, it’s actually a luxury that I can get advice from those two, since they’re pretty fashionable.

            Uu~myu. I don’t wanna take up their time, so I didn’t plan on contacting ‘em, but…
            {% endbubble %}
            {% bubble Tetora smile %}
            Aight, I think I’ll rely on ‘em a li’l after all!

            Daily efforts are important, after all.

            {% bubble Tetora smilesoft %}
            As in, building up on your hard work every day is important, whether for karate or fashion, right?

            There’s no harm in being fashionable as someone who does work that involves being in front of others, and it’s a great opportunity to get advice ‘bout it.
            {% endbubble %}
            {% bubble Tetora smileconfident %}
            If I get to buy somethin’ good, I’ll be sure to show ya too, Anego~♪

Ah— Shinobu-kun messaged me…? I’ll have to excuse myself a li’l.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora norsmile %}
Aight, it was just a reminder that Ryuseitai’s having a gathering soon.

We’ve all been busy lately, after all. So it looks like he went through the effort of sending me a reminder!

            This is… a box of cakes?

            Another staff member bought it as an apology, but nobody is using it now? You sure it’s alright I take this…?
            {% endbubble %}
            {% bubble Tetora grin %}
            Got it! Then I’d be glad to take it! I’ll happily eat it along with everyone in Ryuseitai!

            Ah, we’re gonna have lunch together today!

            Morisawa-senpai found a tasty restaurant, so he invited us to join him ’cuz he wanted to go with everyone.
            {% endbubble %}
            {% bubble Tetora fist %}
            That’s why I skipped breakfast today, so I could enjoy my meal even more! I’m lookin’ forward to it!
