Uumyu… There's still so much I dunno…

Ah— Did I say that out loud!? I'm real sorry if I'm disturbing your break.

Huh? You'll hear me out? You're really kind, Anzu-Anego.

            Still, that doesn't automatically mean it's a natural part of the job.

            There's no other producer out there who treats us this kindly than you, Anego. I'm always grateful to you~♪

            Nah, not at all! As you can see, I'm filled to the brim with energy!

            I'm feelin' pretty good lately, maybe 'cuz of this new exercise I added to my training regime recently. Muscles really are important to take care of…♪

{% bubble Tetora v2 %}
Truth is, I have to do a job related to a fish commercial.

I thought to study up some more about fish, so I read a reference book I borrowed from Shinkai-senpai.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora sightired %}
But there's just so many types of fish that I don't feel like I'll be able to learn any of 'em…

            True, studying and training aren't something you can manage through in one night.

            I dunno if this'll come in handy, but… I'll keep looking through the book 'til the day our job starts!

            How about someone teaches you?

            {% bubble Tetora awkward0 %}
            At first, I thought to ask Shinkai-senpai teach me, but while there are times his explanations are easy to understand, there are also just as many where it's impossible to…

            So for now, I'll do my best on my own as much as I can. If I really can't manage it, I'll ask him.

            Oh yeah, maybe it'll be easier to remember if I were to see them in real life.

            I think I'll try and find the time to go to one! I'm so glad I asked you for advice, Anego~♪

{% bubble Tetora v2 %}
I've got no choice but to go step by step, and start from whatever I'm capable of. I'll also ask Shinobu-kun and Midori-kun for their advice.

But huh, after using my head, I'm getting the urge to move my body…

I wonder if the training room's free right now? If it is, I think I'll do some light training!

            Ah, you passed by that room?

            Then I'll head over there now. Thank you for all your help, Anego!

            Huh? No, no, I'll prepare that myself. I can't keep takin' more of your time!

            But I appreciate the thought, Anego. You've given me the strength to work hard in my training~♪

            Taishou was there a moment ago!? Will I be able to see him if I run now…?

            Thank you so much for letting me know! I'll head off, then!
