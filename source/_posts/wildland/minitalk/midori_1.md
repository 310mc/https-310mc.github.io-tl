Anzu-san, hello. Erm, are you trying to fix that shelf…?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori serious %}
You’re doing it by yourself because you’re the first to notice it? You could’ve just left it to a handyman, since it isn’t your own belonging to tend to…

It seems like a lot of work, so if you’re alright with it, I’ll help you out.

            I think I’ll manage it somehow.

            It doesn’t look that way to me at all, though…? You clearly looked to be struggling, y’know…?
            {% endbubble %}
            {% bubble Midori sighfrown %}
            Ah, I’m sorry for how arrogant I sounded. I’m not even skilled at this myself…
            {% endbubble %}
            {% bubble Midori norsmile %}
            But I’ve got the free time right now, so you don’t have to hold back, really.

            Alright. Which part do you want to fix?

            Ah, this part is pretty shaky, huh.

            I think I should be able to fix something this simple. Please wait a moment.

{% bubble Midori smileexplain %}
…There we go. I think I managed to fix the shaky part back in place.

But I’m no professional, so if it’s looking bad again, please ask for a handyman, okay?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori smilesoft %}
It’s perfect? I’m glad then…♪

            Do you have any tips and tricks?

            {% bubble Midori norsmile %}
            No, nothing in particular… It’s just that I don’t dislike doing DIY stuff.

            You’re pretty dexterious, Anzu-san, so once you get used to it, I’m sure you could do it even better than I ever could.

            Ah, let me send you the DIY site I usually look through.

            Yeah, lately at least.[^1] I fixed something up at my dorm room just the other day.

            One of Aoba-senpai’s furniture broke, and he seemed to be in a lot of trouble over it, so I helped him out.
            {% endbubble %}
            {% bubble Midori smile %}
            Tenma-kun joined in to help too, so it got fixed up pretty quickly. I was really glad we got it done without any problems.

{% bubble Midori curious %}
Something fell off the edge of the shelf… Maybe something that was stuck on the shelf fell out while we were fixing it?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori surprised %}
…T-This is a sticker of ‘Tropical Troppeys’!?[^2]

And it’s a *super* rare one at that! Only *five* of these were ever made…! It’s not as sticky anymore, but I want it so bad…!

            I think it’s fine if you have it.

            {% bubble Midori shocked %}
            Are you sure!? But it’s a super valuable premium sticker, y’know…?

            {% bubble Midori norsmile %}
            Ah, you’re right, to someone who isn’t interested in this sort of thing, they wouldn’t see any value in it, so… This might just get thrown away if nobody takes it.
            {% endbubble %}
            {% bubble Midori smile %}
            In that case, I’d be glad to have it. Thank you so much…♪

            {% bubble Midori northinking %}
            Yeah, it really is strange. Maybe someone who isn’t that interested in yuruchara happened to get a hold of it, and then stuck it on the edge of the shelf?
            {% endbubble %}
            {% bubble Midori curious %}
            Either way, it doesn’t seem like it was treasured much, so is it alright if I have it?
            {% endbubble %}
            {% bubble Midori grin %}
            Thank you so much…♪ I’ll tidy up this little guy up all by myself and treasure it for life, I assure you that.
