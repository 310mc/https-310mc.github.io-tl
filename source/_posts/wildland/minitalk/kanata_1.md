{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata smileconfident %}
anzu-san, hello\~ what a [coincidence] meeting you here\~

ah, i was not at the [aquarium] before this. i had just come back from an [art museum], actually.

            That’s unusual.

        <div class="minitalk-option_content">
            {% bubble Kanata northinking %}
            mm~ true, i think i go to the [aquarium] much more than an [art museum], don’t i?
            {% endbubble %}
            {% bubble Kanata norsmile %}
            but even i enjoy admiring the [arts] every once in a while.
            {% endbubble %}
            {% bubble Kanata nod2 %}
            fufu, it sounds a little [cool] if i say it like that, right~?

            {% bubble Kanata smileexplain %}
            this is a [collection] of [pictures] i bought at the [art museum]~

            all the [paintings] in the [art museum] are in this [book].
            {% endbubble %}
            {% bubble Kanata smilesoft %}
            in other words, i can [enjoy] the [art museum] even after i have returned home…♪

{% bubble Kanata norsmile2 %}
there was someone we [worked with] at a ryuseitai job before, and they were the ones who told me about this [exhibition] happening today.

it is an [exhibition] with [fish paintings] from all over the world!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata v2 %}
even though it was an [art museum], it felt as though i was in an [aquarium]…♪
{% endbubble %}

<div class="minitalk" character="Anzu">
    <div class="minitalk-option">
        <div class="minitalk-option_header">
            So that’s why you went to it.
        </div>
        <div class="minitalk-option_content">
            {% bubble Kanata smile %}
            fufu, you look like you understand why i was there now.

            all the [paintings] were charming in their own way, and i could feel the love for [fish] in them.
            {% endbubble %}
            {% bubble Kanata northinking %}
            it makes me want to draw something once i get home. i wonder what sort of [fish painting] i should go with…?

    </div>
    <div class="minitalk-option">
        <div class="minitalk-option_header">
            Was there any painting you enjoyed the most?
        </div>
        <div class="minitalk-option_content">
            {% bubble Kanata smileconfident %}
            yes, of course there was.

            it was the [painting] of a [large sharkie] swimming happily with [small fishies].
            {% endbubble %}
            {% bubble Kanata smileexplain %}
            there was [merchandise] for it too, so i bought some [postcards]. i will give one to you, anzu-san.

{% bubble Kanata norsmile3 %}
i would like to go to the art museum again while they are [having] this particular exhibition.

since it is only around for a limited time, i will invite someone to come with me next time around.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata smileexplain %}
maybe kaoru would be interested to join. would you like to as well, anzu-san?
{% endbubble %}

<div class="minitalk" character="Anzu">
    <div class="minitalk-option">
        <div class="minitalk-option_header">
            I’m interested.
        </div>
        <div class="minitalk-option_content">
            {% bubble Kanata smileconfident %}
            wah, i am so glad. then it is settled, right~?
            {% endbubble %}
            {% bubble Kanata curious %}
            but anzu-san, i did not expect you to be interested in [fish paintings].
            {% endbubble %}
            {% bubble Kanata grin %}
            ah, you try your best to look at various things for the sake of work, too? good girl, good girl~♪
			{% endbubble %}
        </div>
    </div>
    <div class="minitalk-option">
        <div class="minitalk-option_header">
            Maybe there’s…
        </div>
        <div class="minitalk-option_content">
            {% bubble Kanata curious %}
            there might be other people interested, so you will see who else might want to [join]?
            {% endbubble %}
            {% bubble Kanata norsmile %}
            then i will leave it to you~ it would be a lot more fun to go with everyone instead of just enjoying it all by myself, after all.
            {% endbubble %}
            {% bubble Kanata smile %}
            would chiaki and souma come, too? fufu, i am already so [excited] to find out.
