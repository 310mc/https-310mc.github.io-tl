ufufu~♪ anzu-san, i will carry your [luggage] if you like; how about it?

i got complimented by a [little child] that i am [very strong], so i am in a good mood.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata grin %}
look, i can easily carry this much [with ease]…♪

            yes. when i was walking down the street, there was a [little kid] struggling to carry a large package. 

            they could have gotten hurt, so i carried it for them instead.
            {% endbubble %}
            {% bubble Kanata nod %}
            then they told me, "amazing, you’re so strong!" with such a happy look on their face…♪

            {% bubble Kanata smile %}
            fufu, now you will compliment me too, anzu-san? thank you very much.
            {% endbubble %}
            {% bubble Kanata smilesoft2 %}
            i was never particularly prideful about being [strong], but…

            when i helped the [little child] carry their package, they looked so happy complimenting me, so i could not help but feel happy as well.

{% bubble Kanata norsmile3 %}
i do not do any [strength training] in particular, but maybe it would be nice to try it out together with chiaki and tetora next time, don’t you think~?

if i could build even more [muscle] than what i have right now, i might be able to lift anzu-san up and even [dance] with her just like that.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata smilesoft %}
actually, i might be able to do that now, too. what do you think, shall we give it a shot?
{% endbubble %}

            I’m sorry, I’d rather not.

            {% bubble Kanata sighfrown %}
            is that so? i thought it would be fun to do, so that is a shame…
            {% endbubble %}
            {% bubble Kanata awkward %}
            ah, but if i [made] a [mistake], it would cause more problems.

            so even if i do build more [muscle] eventually, it is probably best i do not go ahead with this idea, wouldn’t it?

    <div class="minitalk-option">
        <div class="minitalk-option_header">
            How about trying it on someone else?

            {% bubble Kanata smileconfident %}
            fufu, someone else, you say? i wonder who would be good?
            {% endbubble %}
            {% bubble Kanata northinking %}
            i could see midori and tetora being against it, but shinobu would hop on the idea, maybe~?
            {% endbubble %}
            {% bubble Kanata smile %}
            i feel like people like rei or wataru, or even kaoru, would be willing to try it out…♪

{% bubble Kanata smileconfident %}
i am in a good mood, so i would like to tell other people what happened, too.

if i remember correctly, chiaki and kaoru have the [day off] today, so… i will ask them if i can see them for a little while.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata smilesoft %}
they said it is [okay]\~ we will eat [fish] while [chatting] together\~
{% endbubble %}

<div class="minitalk" character="Anzu">

          Will you do it at the dorms?

        <div class="minitalk-option_content">
            {% bubble Kanata norsmile3 %}
            yes. if we chat at the dorms, others could [join] us, too.

            and there is a lot of [fish] in the [fridge], so we can cook with that…
            {% endbubble %}
            {% bubble Kanata grin %}
            fufu, i think it will be a very [fulfilling day], don’t you think?

    <div class="minitalk-option">
        <div class="minitalk-option_header">
            Will you do it at a restaurant?

        <div class="minitalk-option_content">
            {% bubble Kanata norsmile %}
            ah, that’s right. if we go to a restaurant, we would not need to prepare any [cutlery] nor [ingredients], right~?

            also, if we do it at a [restaurant] instead of the [dorms], then anzu-san can also [join in]. if it is alright, would you like to join us~?
            {% endbubble %}
            {% bubble Kanata smile %}
            ufufu\~♪ then today, let’s all [dress nicely] and have a fun [banquet] with fish\~♪
