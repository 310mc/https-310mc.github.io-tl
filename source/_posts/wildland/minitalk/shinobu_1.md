I’ll replace this panel with a new drawing… like this?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shinobu nod %}
Ooh! Now that looks a lot more like it! You have my gratitude, Anzu-dono!

By making a poster with a yonkoma comic strip, there will surely be more students who’ll find interest in the Ninja Association! ♪

            It looks really good, after all.

            {% bubble Shinobu smileconfident %}
            The reason for that is all thanks to you, Anzu-dono.

            While I do enjoy reading manga, I’m completely unfamiliar with drawing one.
            {% endbubble %}
            {% bubble Shinobu grin %}
            I’m so glad I had someone to give me just the advice I needed!

            I’m sure you’ll get more people interested.

            {% bubble Shinobu norsmile %}
            You believe so too, Anzu-dono?

            I don’t necessarily want special attention over this, but in the end, wanting to share the things that you do with others is just another part of human nature.
            {% endbubble %}
            {% bubble Shinobu smile %}
            With this comic, I’m sure that will become a reality…♪

{% bubble Shinobu smileexplain %}
It was actually Isara-dono’s idea to try adding a comic strip in the poster.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shinobu awkward %}
After receiving such an incredible idea, I felt like I *had* to make use of it, but… Just drawing a yonkoma comic alone is a painstaking task, huh~?

I have even more respect for all the professional manga artists out there now.
{% endbubble %}

<div class="minitalk" character="Anzu">
    <div class="minitalk-option">
        <div class="minitalk-option_header">
            In that case…
        </div>
        <div class="minitalk-option_content">
            {% bubble Shinobu norsmile2 %}
            Ahh, if I asked someone who draws manga how its like, I might be able to learn even more indeed.
            {% endbubble %}
            {% bubble Shinobu curious %}
            That being said, I don’t believe there’s anyone I know like that…
            {% endbubble %}
            {% bubble Shinobu grin %}
            You’ll introduce me to someone, Anzu-dono? That would be a great help! ♪
			{% endbubble %}

    <div class="minitalk-option">
        <div class="minitalk-option_header">
            The pros are just incredible, aren’t they?

        <div class="minitalk-option_content">
            {% bubble Shinobu smile %}
            They certainly are! They think up everything on their own, from the story to the art itself.

            It’s something they wouldn’t be able to accomplish unless they’re someone with a lot of passion and skill.
            {% endbubble %}
            {% bubble Shinobu northinking %}
            For someone skillful, Mayoi-dono also fits the bill… Perhaps he would surprisingly be able to draw one?

{% bubble Shinobu curious %}
You’re suggesting that I upload the comic strip I drew on social media…?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shinobu awkward %}
No, no. It’s merely an amateur’s work, and it’s too embarrassing to upload it~
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shinobu smile %}
But I did go through all ths effort, so I’ll start by sending it to everyone in Ryuseitai first. Here goes!
{% endbubble %}


<div class="minitalk" character="Anzu">
    <div class="minitalk-option">
        <div class="minitalk-option_header">
            Did anyone respond?

        <div class="minitalk-option_content">
            {% bubble Shinobu smilesoft %}
            Ah, Midori-kun responded.
            {% endbubble %}
            {% bubble Shinobu curious %}
            “It looks like a yuruchara, so cute”… Huh, I was going for a cool-looking ninja, though…
            {% endbubble %}
            {% bubble Shinobu fist %}
            But I’d rather hear that than someone not liking it, so I’m happy. I’ll thank Midori-kun for the compliment!
			{% endbubble %}

    </div>
    <div class="minitalk-option">
        <div class="minitalk-option_header">
            Did they all see it?
        </div>
        <div class="minitalk-option_content">
            {% bubble Shinobu nod %}
            Ah, everyone responded. I’m delighted to see so many positive reactions~♪
            {% endbubble %}
            {% bubble Shinobu norsmile2 %}
            Shinkai-dono in particular enjoyed it quite a lot, it seems. “The fish on the right edge is lovely”…
            {% endbubble %}
            {% bubble Shinobu northinking %}
            This was supposed to be a shuriken, but… Now that he mentions it, it does sort of look like a fish too, doesn’t it?
