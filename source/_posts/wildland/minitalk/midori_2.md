{% bubble Midori smilesoft %}
Haah, this loose-looking energy is just perfect…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori smileconfident %}
Ah, Anzu-san! Could you take a look at this?

Isn’t it so cute? It’s a new drawing from Master Artist Fushimi…♪

            Is it a drawing of a human…?

            {% bubble Midori smileexplain %}
            You’re on the mark, but you’re looking at it from the opposite angle. This is the correct way to look at it.
            {% endbubble %}
            {% bubble Midori nod %}
            The more I look at it, the more there is to appreciate about it… It’s such a soothing drawing to look at, don’t you think?

            Ahh~ This must be what you call a “God-given talent”. This is the one time I want to express my gratitude to God…♪

            It isn’t, but maybe you could think of it that way depending on how you look at it…?
            {% endbubble %}
            {% bubble Midori smile %}
            Every time I look at it from a different angle, it shows me a different expression. This must mean it’s one of illustration masterpieces, right?

            Anzu-san, thank you for giving me such a beautiful realization about it~♪

{% bubble Midori norsmile2 %}
When I was looking through the storybook of Alice in Wonderland at the resting room, Master Artist Fushimi happened to pass by and greet me.

At that moment, I felt like seeing Master Artist Fushimi’s depiction of Alice in Wonderland…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori grin %}
So I asked him out of the blue, and he agreed to draw me something if I promised to keep it short. I’m so happy…♪

            {% bubble Midori smileconfident %}
            Ah, good to know you’re even looking at the corners…♪ This is the Cheshire Cat.

            Its grinning face looks so loose and adorable, it’s the *best*…
            {% endbubble %}
            {% bubble Midori smilesoft %}
            Oh, I know. I’ll take a photo of it and set it as my phone’s wallpaper. It’ll fill me with happiness every time I open my phone…♪

            {% bubble Midori smileexplain %}
            Look at this part more closely. Do you see the watch?
            {% endbubble %}
            {% bubble Midori norsmile %}
            Yes, it’s the white rabbit. It looks so unique with its surprisingly long ears.
            {% endbubble %}
            {% bubble Midori northinking %}
            If it actually existed in real life, I’d gladly adore it every day with hugs… Maybe I’ll have a manufacturer make one…?

{% bubble Midori norsmile %}
I need to prepare the perfect picture frame to put this drawing in.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori northinking %}
Maybe I’ll go check out a shop and buy one while on my way home. Was there an art supplies store nearby…?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori curious %}
Huh? There’s a spare frame in the ES warehouse? But wouldn’t it be wrong of me to have it…?
{% endbubble %}

<div class="minitalk" character="Anzu">
    <div class="minitalk-option">
        <div class="minitalk-option_header">
          It was going to be disposed of, so…
        </div>
        <div class="minitalk-option_content">
            {% bubble Midori norsmile2 %}
            It was taking up space in the warehouse, so they were planning to collect everything and dispose of it, huh…

            If it’s just going to get thrown away, then punishment won’t fall on me for taking it, right…?
            {% endbubble %}
            {% bubble Midori smileconfident %}
            Alright then, may I have it later? Once I do, I’ll be sure to fit this drawing in perfectly.
			{% endbubble %}

    </div>
    <div class="minitalk-option">
        <div class="minitalk-option_header">
            I think it would suit this drawing perfectly.
        </div>
        <div class="minitalk-option_content">
            {% bubble Midori norsmile3 %}
            Huh, well if you say it so confidently, then it must be true…?
            {% endbubble %}
            {% bubble Midori smilesoft %}
            A picture frame that suits this drawing perfectly, huh… I wonder what it looks like? I hope it has some cute decorations…♪
            {% endbubble %}
            {% bubble Midori smileexplain %}
            Since you might go through all this effort for me, may I see it first? If I like it, I’d be glad to take it.
