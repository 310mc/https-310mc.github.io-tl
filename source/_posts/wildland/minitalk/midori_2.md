Ah, Anzu-san. The truth is, I'm going to Okinawa with everyone in Ryuseitai tomorrow.

Shinkai-senpai suddenly mentioned it… It was such a surprise.

I don't hate going out on trips, but I'm a little anxious about a bunch of things…

            Yeah. I'm planning to take a lot of change of clothes, and a bunch of other stuff.

            But well, I'll be with everyone in Ryuseitai. Even if a problem happens, I think it'll work out just fine.

            Yes… I was filled with worry in practice today, not knowing how it'll end up…

            I'm a little more anxious than the time I was the commander. But well, this is Shinkai-senpai we're talking about, so it should end up alright by the end…

{% bubble Midori norsmile %}
Oh yeah. Since I'm going to Okinawa and all, is there any souvenir you'd like?

I'm going to buy a lot of the region's yuruchara merchandise, so I can split the share with you too, Anzu-san~♪

If there's anything else you'd like, please let me know. Ahh, but I can't really buy anything too expensive…

            Sweets… Sata andagi is famous over there, aren't they? Alright, I'll buy that for you.

            I think there's a lot of flavors for it, so please let me know if there's any specific flavor you prefer.

            Ahh, something like a key holder would be nice, then? But I'm not sure if I can buy one that you'll like…

            If it's alright, could I send you photos of some options? I'd like to know your thoughts on what to get you.

{% bubble Midori norsmile %}
Whew… Talking to you has made me feel excited for my trip to Okinawa~♪

I wonder if it's because you look so happy while listening to me…?

I'll be far from ES, so I don't think we'll be able to see each other for a while… But I'll do my best with everyone and come back.

            Yes, of course. You too, Anzu-san, please take care of your health.

            I'm sure we'll both have it rough with our work for a while, but I'm looking forward to the next time we can meet without any worries…♪
