I feel like it's been a while since you and I ate together in the cafeteria!

Ahh, that's true, we haven't been seeing each other as of late…

Us Ryuseitai had been practicing for a commercial, and had even gone to Okinawa.

            I don't think I'll have enough time to mention everything that had happened in Okinawa, but…

            It made me happy that I could accomplish what Kanata wanted to do. I've had my fair share of struggles in Okinawa before, but this time around, I made a lot of lovely memories!

            Yeah. I believe it was a great experience for us in Ryuseitai.

            I'll tell you all about it at a later date, alongside a report of our job. I'd like you to watch our footage, too.

            Yep, exactly. The commander of Ryuseitai this time was Kanata. He's the one who got a job for us at Okinawa.

            To be honest, I wasn't sure how it would turn out at first… But Kanata did his job properly as the leader!

Okinawa was pretty hot even in this period of time. I got a sunburn from it.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki awkward %}
It's still spring, so I got careless and forgot to bring sunscreen with me…

My arms and face sting a little.

            Hm, hm. When you're sunburnt, it's as if you've got a light burn, so cooling the skin helps…?

            Alright. When I get back to the dorms, I'll cool my skin with a cold wet towel!

            Oh yeah, I heard sliced cucumbers are good for the skin when you're sunburnt… But does it actually work?

            Well, I won't know unless I try. I'll give it a shot.

            Mm. Sena scolded me yesterday, too… He told me that sunscreen should be applied throughout the whole year, not just summer.

            Sena gave me sunscreen he always recommends to use, so I'm planning to apply it every day from now on.

{% bubble Chiaki %}
Oh yeah, I bought some souvenirs. At first, I had told my unitmates that we aren't here for a fun sightseeing trip, but everyone looked like they wanted to buy something in the end.

So to advertise the souvenir ships in the market street, we bought all kinds of Okinawa souvenirs. I got something for you, too~♪

I left them all in the agency office, so could I give it to you at a later time?

            Heheh, you don't even know what the souvenir yet, yet you're this happy?

            Ah, don't worry, I didn't buy anything strange. I'm sure you'll love it! ☆

            But don't you have work after this? In that case, let me be the one to pass it to you.

            I'm only going to go home after this, so don't worry, there's no need to hold back!

            It's a small Shisa ornament! Apparently, it's good fortune to place it in your home as a guardian deity.

            By the way, I bought myself one, too. I placed it right next to my hero toy figures in my dorm room~♪
