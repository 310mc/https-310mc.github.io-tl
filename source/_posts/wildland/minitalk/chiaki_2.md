{% bubble Chiaki norsmile2 %}
The other day, I went out to eat grilled meat with my roommates.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki smilesoft %}
We all found the food tasty and ate it wholeheartedly, but Otogari in particular was incredible.

He kept gobbling up plates of meat one after the other. He got through a bunch of plates in no time…☆

            It must’ve been a wonderful manner of eating.

            {% bubble Chiaki smile %}
            Yeah, that must’ve been exactly what people mean by “great manner of eating”!
            {% endbubble %}
            {% bubble Chiaki nod2 %}
            It was to the point that it felt refreshing just watching him, so Yuuki even took a video.

            He might’ve put it up on social media. I’ll try to look for it!

            {% bubble Chiaki smileconfident %}
            Mm? Haha, don’t worry about that. We went to an all-you-can eat grilled meat buffet!
            {% endbubble %}
            {% bubble Chiaki curious %}
            If that’s how much he loves meat, then as a senior, I wish I treated him to high-quality food…
            {% endbubble %}
            {% bubble Chiaki grin %}
            But I’m sure Sakuma or Hakaze will make that come true for him. They’re his seniors from his unit, after all! ☆

{% bubble Chiaki fist %}
After we finished our meal, we went to a nearby park to help digest our food.

It was night-time, so there weren’t any kids around. It was a lot of fun to let myself relive my childhood and play around!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki grin %}
The way Otogari moved in the park was also incredible! For a moment, I thought to myself, “this must be what you call being wild!”
{% endbubble %}

            Incredible, as in…?

            {% bubble Chiaki fist %}
            He was like a first-rate stuntman. His movements were so skillful and sharp!
            {% endbubble %}
            {% bubble Chiaki smilesoft %}
            I was aware of Otogari’s physical ability through Sports Survivors, but I felt impressed by it once more.

            As Ryusei Red, I can’t allow myself to fall back either…☆

            {% bubble Chiaki smileconfident %}
            Yeah, it was a lot of fun! Yuuki was a bit taken aback at first, but he started to enjoy himself too as he kept playing more.

            We’re all busy, so we can’t go that often, but I’d still like to go there again sometime.

            It sounds like fun to go there with everyone in Ryuseitai, too. I’m sure Sengoku would gladly join me~♪

{% bubble Chiaki norsmile %}
Becoming a working member of society means also having ways to play as a working adult, but playing around like when you were young every once in a while is nice, too.[^1]

Plus, it feels nice to move your body as much as you like~♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki curious %}
Speaking of which, Anzu… What sort of games did you play when you were young?
{% endbubble %}

<div class="minitalk" character="Anzu">
    <div class="minitalk-option">
        <div class="minitalk-option_header">
          Talking about things…
        </div>
        <div class="minitalk-option_content">
            {% bubble Chiaki norsmile2 %}
            I see! It’s hard to run out of topics when talking with friends, right?

            I wonder if it gets lively between girls when the conversation is about things like fashion, too…?
            {% endbubble %}
            {% bubble Chiaki smilesoft %}
            Ah, just imagining Anzu talking to her friends as a kid feels heartwarming to me…♪
			{% endbubble %}
        </div>
    </div>
    <div class="minitalk-option">
        <div class="minitalk-option_header">
            I used to play tag.
        </div>
        <div class="minitalk-option_content">
            {% bubble Chiaki smile %}
            Play tag? That’s a simple game, but it’s also the most exciting!

            Do you prefer to be “it”? Or do you prefer to be the one who runs away?

            The latter, huh? You’re pretty nimble, so it must be tough to catch you!
