    <p>One year since ES’s establishment. In May — During a Ryuseitai meeting…</p>

{% bubble Chiaki awkward %}
I hope you’re all doing well! …Ah, I’m the last to arrive? I hope I didn’t make you all wait…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shinobu smilesoft %}
I hope you’re doing well too, Morisawa-dono. You didn’t make us wait at all.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata smileexplain %}
yes. i also only arrived a moment ago.

oh, that’s right. i will give this to chiaki, too. it is a [new product] being sold in [aoumi aquarium].
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki norsmile %}
Hmm, what’s this…? Oooh, water manjuu![^1] Based on the packaging, I assume it’s meant to be like a jellyfish?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata grin %}
ufufu. i came up with the idea when i saw the [kudzu noodles] souma brought over.[^2]

both jellyfish and water manjuu are [transparent] and wobbly, so they are a perfect match, don’t you think?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki grin %}
Yeah, I think it’s an amazing idea! I’ll gladly have some…♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori curious %}
Erm, is it okay to start the meeting now?

Actually, isn’t it Shinobu-kun’s job to do this?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shinobu norsmile %}
I appreciate you saying it in my stead!

But it is nothing we need to rush to discuss, so there is no need to worry about the time.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora idle %}
Huh, really? You said you wanted to have a meeting as soon as possible, and since that’s a pretty rare request comin’ from you, I sorta expected it’d be ‘bout somethin’ important.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori frown %}
Same. I was worried something had come up in the project Shinobu-kun worked on as the commander…[^3]
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shinobu smileexplain %}
You can rest at ease with that. I am proceeding with all the after-event tasks without any issues!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata curious %}
then why did you call for a [meeting] as early as possible? you must have something you want to tell us, yes?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shinobu fist %}
Of course! I brought over wonderful news today…♪

For you see, we’ve received an offer directly requesting for us to appear in ‘UNDERLAND’!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori srsthinking %}
‘UNDERLAND’?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora curious %}
‘UNDERLAND’ is that live show event themed around Alice in Wonderland, right?

I remember Tomoya-kun and Hiiro-kun gettin’ real busy when it was time to participate in it.[^4]
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori northinking %}
Oh yeah, I remember hearing something about that…

But isn’t there some sort of screening process for that?[^5]
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora smilesoft %}
Yep, I think so. ‘Cuz I remember Tomoya-kun being real happy when his unit got the role in ‘UNDERLAND’.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shinobu norsmile %}
The management hasn’t changed, but it seems that the contents of the project is undergoing massive updates.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki norsmile2 %}
‘UNDERLAND’ was also originally ‘WONDERLAND’, after all. By making alterations every year, they likely avoid getting stuck in a rut.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shinobu smile %}
According to the project’s details, it’s turning from a large-scale live show-based event, to a focus around a collaboration with a theme park.

There’s a theme park that recently added an area based on Alice in Wonderland…

And various units will perform collaboration events that match with each attraction in the area.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora curious %}
A collaboration with a theme park? They’re puttin’ a lotta effort in this, huh?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shinobu grin %}
And it does not end there. The unit they’d like to have for the opening event of that project is none other than Ryuseitai!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki surprised %}
That’s… a pretty major role for us, isn’t it!?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shinobu fist %}
It indeed is! Apart from the live show event in the theme park, they’ve also approached us with a request to film an MV that utilizes VR.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori worried0 %}
Erm, I can tell from what you’ve said so far that a pretty huge job has come our way, but…

Why did they choose <em>us</em> for a job as big as this? So many things happened last year that I can’t help but feel anxious, like there’s an ulterior motive to this somewhere…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora sighfrown %}
Mm~ I’m not suspectin’ an ulterior motive like Midori-kun, but yeah, there’s somethin’ about this that doesn’t sit right with me.

Like, for starters, Alice in Wonderland’s pretty heavy in its fantasy elements, while Ryuseitai’s a hero unit. Don’tcha guys feel like it’s a bad combo somehow?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora srsthinking %}
I could understand it if we had participated in ‘WONDERLAND’ or ‘UNDERLAND’ before, and if our performance had gotten a lotta raving reviews…

But we don’t even have that, so being chosen as the openin’ unit all’a sudden feels kinda weird.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki norsmile %}
Yeah, I understand Nagumo’s point, too.

But isn’t this, in a way, the result of the new Ryuseitai’s activity policy garnering recognition?

After ‘Supervillains’[^6], Ryuseitai powered up on a massive scale. And now that Ryuseitai is a unique unit where all members are leaders, we’ve started to heavily emphasize our individual colors.[^7]

Such as RB, in which Nagumo acted as the leader, and Yuruseitai, in which Takamine acted as the leader…[^8]

We challenged ourselves to projects we never could’ve imagined taking on during the days I was the sole commander, and then achieved success.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki smilesoft %}
Isn’t it possible that the ‘UNDERLAND’ management staff had seen our activities as the new Ryuseitai, and offered this to us knowing we could do it with the way we are now?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shinobu smileconfident %}
It is exactly as Morisawa-dono says.

When I received note about this job, they mentioned that they’d like Ryuseitai to take on the job due to the vigor our unit gives off.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora northinking %}
Our unit gives off vigor, huh… So that’s how the public’s startin’ to see us?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shinobu norsmile %}
Also, Tetora-kun may have said that it’s a bad combination, but actually, the image is not that far off from our unit.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori curious %}
Huh? Did we have some common link with Alice in Wonderland…?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki srsthinking %}
If it’s to do with the “mysterious wonder” genre, then I feel as though it’s Kanata who’s the closest to Alice in Wonderland’s image…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata glare %}
what is <em>that</em> supposed to mean, chiaki?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shinobu smileexplain %}
As I said earlier, the ‘UNDERLAND’ project is undergoing various updates this year.

I had called it ‘UNDERLAND’ out of convenience so that you all could understand the topic faster, but as a matter of fact, it already has a different project name.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shinobu smilesoft %}
Unlike the previous world of Alice in Wonderland, where everything was dark… A new world of Alice will be spun together—

And its name is none other than ‘WILDLAND’…☆
