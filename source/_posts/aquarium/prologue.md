*puka, puka~*

…ohh? hello, anzu-san~♪

what are you doing here? are you here to bathe in the water too?

the ocean during these times is at a good temperature, after all…♪

see, the water is body temperature. it makes you feel like you are being embraced by the mother ocean~…♪

hmm, i am wrong? you are picking up litter while taking a walk?

now that you mention it, you are wearing a jersey, which is the perfect way to exercise. and you also have a garbage bag with you.

hmm, i see… lately, yumenosaki has been bustling with activity, and the dreamfes have big audiences.

there are notices about it, but there are still some people with bad manners…

would *you* throw litter around as you visit your neighbor's ocean?

it is absolutely inexcusable. the ocean has an autopurification system, but humans dirty it much more than it can handle.

leaving behind all these things that cannot decompose, like plastics, vinyls, bottles, toxic waste…

this is abuse, *domestic* abuse.

you could not ignore that, so you are picking up the litter, right? that is wonderful. good girl, gooood girl… ♪

oooh. so you will just look at how bad it is for now, and if it looks extremely bad then you will take up a school part-time job related to picking up litter.

but cleaning up the whole ocean by yourself is impossible, you know…?

you would have to rely on everyone’s strength, or a very strong power.

when i become an adult, i will be able to use that kind of power…

and then i would also like to make the ocean clean. it would be my repayment to the kindness from the mother ocean.

right now, i am not very reliable to the ocean…

but at the very least, i will help you out by carrying the garbage bag for you, anzu-san. i will help out as much as i can~

hehe, leave it to me. i may not look it, but i have quite the strength~♪

{% bubble Kanata %}
whew… in the end, we got really into it, and ended up picking up all the litter.

it is completely dark now… anzu-san, where do you live? i will take you back home.

it is dangerous for a girl to walk alone, after all. you may get attacked by a monster, or a bad person.

but do not worry, it will be okay. i will protect you, no matter what happens.

hehehe, i sounded just a little like a hero… ♪

huh? you have never heard of a hero who walks around drenched wet, looking all suspicious?

they probably do exist. i have heard that there are many kinds of heroes out there in this world, you know?

chiaki told me all about them.

well… you see, i often watch tokusatsu shows with everyone in ryuseitai, so i am completely aware of these things.

i find them a bit hard to watch, though…

because, no matter what i do, i empathize more with the villain… with the aberration.[^1]

but, if the heroes' bonds become stronger after defeating them…

and if they are able to ascertain their sense of justice even further…

then those aberration would have had value in existing as well.

… wah! anzu-san, you are rubbing me with a towel without even listening to what i was saying, aren't you?

it is a little too rough~ please do it a little softer, like how a mother would.

ah, no, i have not seen my mother that often… it is simply the image i have of one, more or less.

yes, my mother is very pretty. but she is also a little scary.

every time i do see her, she scolds me. because i am not a good child at all.

i do not want to be scolded, and i do not want to cause trouble to everyone, either… so i do want to try and become a good child.

i do, even if it meant that i could not become a hero. i want to become a good child—the kind a hero would rescue.

but right now, it is still too difficult for me.

i guess i will always be a mysterious aberration, won't i?

…………

…ah, that’s right! please wait a moment. *(rustle, rustle)*

anzu-san, this is for you.

this is my “thank you” for listening to me. and also because i have to share these, but was not sure how…

so i still have plenty with me.

yes, this is a ticket to the aquarium.

please take it. it is your reward for being a hard worker.

now then, let's keep going. if you do not return home soon, the people at home will worry for you… anzu-san.

## Translation Notes
[^1]: The word Kanata uses for “aberration” is *kaijin* 怪人, which is also a term in tokusatsu to refer to characters who are typically antagonistic humanoids. (In other words, usually villains.) You can find more info [here](https://dic.pixiv.net/a/%E6%80%AA%E4%BA%BA) (It’s in Japanese).
