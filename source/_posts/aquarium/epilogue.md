{% bubble Kanata v2 %}
“hellooo everyone~ thank you for coming over to our live show today~♪”

“to the children sitting in the front seats, please be careful and watch your step, so that you don’t slip and fall into the pool~♪”

“there will be a lot of splashing about, so may all the mommys and daddies take good care of their children, please?”

“and now! to the people in the back seats\~! hello\~! ♪”

“fufufu, did i startle all of you? i asked the talented mr. dolphin to spring both of us up high~♪”

“it may be hard for the people in the back seats to see the pool because of how far away the seats are…”

“but i’ll spring up like this every once in a while to greet you all~♪”

“ufufu, thank you for waving your hands! and now for the special fan service~ <em><th>(kiss)</th></em> ♪”

“yes, mr. dolphin just gave me a kiss! i’m so happy~♪”

“ah, are you alright? did it hurt you?”

“hmm… it only startled you for a moment? okay, i am glad~ you are such a strong child~♪”
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Souma %}
……Buchou-dono is handling that *“dol-fin”* magnificently. The sight is beautiful, but what he is doing is normally quite preposterous, is it not?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Madara %}
Hahaha, are you really saying that after all this time you’ve known him? Kanata-san has always been dearly loved by sea creatures. No one knows if it’s true, but they say it’s because he comes from a family that dominated the ocean.

Long ago in ancient times, his ancestors lived their lives with the ocean’s tides, and they built a paradise within its depths.

And since that blood runs in his own veins, he will be made the head of the family. But that’s all just a fairytale.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Souma %}
You do not need to tell me, I am aware of the general story of the tale. However, I cannot think of it as nothing but a fairytale, as it seems that the people of power within this region deeply respect Buchou-dono’s family lineage.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Madara %}
Deeply respect, huh? It looks more like they're trying to atone for something to me, though…

This is also just folklore, but it’s said that the rich folks of this region used those in his lineage as a sacrificial lamb for prosperity.

But yeah, it’s such an old tale that no one knows if it’s true anymore.

I’m the type to try and find out more about valuable things with ancient history attached to them, but unlike Nagisa-san, I have no interest in purposely taking those things right out from the graveyard.

If things are happy in the present times, then that’s good enough for me! Hahaha!! ☆
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kaoru %}
Alright you guys, less chit-chatting and more working~

But I’m really amazed by you guys. This was a sudden live, but everyone’s on track with each other’s steps.

*Especially* Souma-kun. I really didn’t see that coming, you looked like you’d be bad at dealing with unexpected situations~♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Souma %}
Do not look down on me. I have gone through training since childhood. I am proficient in all kinds of performance arts.

I am somewhat bewildered by all of this, but I will not be performing in any way that could falter my seniors.

Also, Buchou-dono has brought me to this aquarium with him plenty of times as part of our Marine Life club activities.

In those cases, I watched the *“dol-fin”* show in the audience seats, and so I am more or less aware of the inner workings of the show.

I have asked Buchou-dono all kinds of questions pertaining to it as well, as I get excited when watching such an admirable performance.

It has long been a dream of mine to play alongside *“dol-fins”* like this… Before falling to sleep, I had often imagined the various acts I would love to attempt were I to ever have the chance.

I am thrilled to know that I have now fulfilled that dream.
{% endbubble %}

{% img /img/es/eventstory/aquarium/soumabcg.jpg %}

{% bubble Souma %}
“Come now, one and all! Those who sit afar, listen closely! Clap your hands to the beat of the music, and feast your eyes on this joyous spectacle! Behold the heart and soul of our performance!”
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata v2 %}
“bravo\~♪ mr. dolphin wonderfully caught the rings souma tossed with its tail\~!”

“a round of applause for you\~♪ i’ll give you fish as reward\~!”
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Souma %}
“Wh-what!? Buchou-dono! I do not particularly want any reward, so please do not toss seafood at me!”
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kaoru %}
Ahaha, you’re really into this, Kanata-kun.

But this is the first time I’ve heard about this whole “going to the aquarium together” thing. That’s weird, I was never invited to this~?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Souma %}
Did you want us to? You come and go with the club, and so our *“tai-ming”* had always been off, and we had thought that forcing you to come would be too much.

And when you do show your face, you usually look very tired as you gaze idly at the water tanks… We had only wanted to let you rest whenever we secretly went off to the aquarium.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kaoru %}
Whaaat~ I don’t have to prepare anything just to go around an aquarium with friends, and I also wanna see all kinds of fish, so invite me next time, okay?

And whenever you can, invite Anzu-chan over, too.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Madara %}
Yeah, please do hang out with her more.

I think she might be bad at making friends, or like, she prioritizes others over herself, so I’m always worried for her.

But right now, I want you to focus on this live show…… What’s wrong, Kaoru-san? You don’t seem focused on the show, you know?

I know you can do it if you try. Yes you can, yes you can~♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kaoru %}
Hnnn… Honestly, I have no will whatsoever, not with the audience full of parents with their children and couples looking all happy.

Seriously, I’m *super* jealous of the couples here… maybe I should splash water at them…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Madara %}
Hahaha, then just show off the most terrific performance ever, something so good that all their attention darts from their lovers to you.

If anyone can do that, it’s you. After all, you’re the most gorgeous, beautiful guy in the whole school~♪
{% endbubble %}

{% img /img/es/eventstory/aquarium/kaorubcg.jpg %}

{% bubble Kaoru %}
Ewww, being complimented by a guy won’t make me happy at *all*~ But you’re right… So how about I elegantly steal away all the girls from their careless boyfriends, hm?

That sounds like a lot of fun to do, and it suits my style… Even if I succeed only for a moment~♪

♪\~♪\~♪
{% endbubble %}

## Chapter 2

{% bubble Madara %}
Okay kids, gather around! It’s time to pet the dolphins~♪

Come, all of you, come!! You have to touch the dolphins gently! It’s not scary, so don’t be scared~! Hahaha!! ☆
{% endbubble %}

{% img /img/es/eventstory/aquarium/madarabcg.jpg %}

{% bubble Madara %}
If the real thing’s still too scary for you, then pet this plush toy version instead!

Here, here! ♪ The real dolphin’s even softer, you know! Dolphins raise their own offspring through milk like us, after all! That makes them our friends!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata v2 %}
<th>(whew… the rogue gave us a chance to rest at a good time.)</th>

<th>(we would only end up getting tired if we kept singing and dancing.)</th>

<th>(not only us, but the dolphins, too.)</th>

<th>(he is not like how he was in the past… he has become much more mindful with people.)</th>

<th>(he is still just as pushy as he has always been, though.)</th>

<th>(like how he was this time… i did not even ask him to, yet he came all the way over to help me… gosh, he is so strange.)</th>

<th>(i have always been so horrible to him, too… i have never once given anything back to him, so why is he always this nice to me?)</th>
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kaoru %}
What’s up, Kanata-kun? You look dazed; you getting tired?

If you are, then you can leave the singing to me and Souma-kun, and you can rest while doing your *puka puka*~♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata v2 %}
i would definitely not *puka puka* during work… while it is a fish’s job to swim, an idol’s duty is to sing and dance.

but i am not tired at all, anyway. this is nothing compared to ryuseitai’s performances.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kaoru %}
Ahh, Ryuseitai’s all about action and stuff, yeah.

UNDEAD’s dances and stuff are rough and intense, too~ I have to push my limits to match up with the energetic youngsters.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata v2 %}
yes… fufufu, we both have it rough, don’t we? but it gives the thrill of being alive, so i do not dislike it being intense, either.

and this time around, we are performing above the water, so i am actually getting more and more energetic~♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kaoru %}
You *are* a sea creature, after all.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata v2 %}
that is right, and so are you, kaoru… so is souma, since we are all part of the marine life club~♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Souma %}
Indeed. It feels cool and pleasant here.

Not only did I have the honor of performing with people other than my *“yu-nit,”* but it was also very refreshing. That does not mean I have any dissatisfactions with Akatsuki, though.

However, it is pleasant to perform side-by-side like this with my friends from the same club every once in awhile.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kaoru %}
Oh? The way you say that sounds like you see me as a pal from the same club now~♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Souma %}
I only partially feel that way. Today you were kind to people around you, such as Anzu-dono, for starters.

I still believe you may have some ulterior motive, but I also believe that the love and kindness you presented was not a lie.

And now I do feel that I had treated you too harshly from being overcautious.

However, I still do not completely trust you… If you get too ahead of yourself and conduct any insolence, I will cut you down with no mercy.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kaoru %}
Well, that’s terrifying… Hey Kanata-kuuun, can’t you scold Souma-kun and tell him to show more respect to his senior?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata v2 %}
fufufu, what is wrong with it? it *is* true that you get too ahead of yourself sometimes. this is good medicine for that; the carrot and stick.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kaoru %}
Whaaat\~? You guys are so harsh\~! I’ve had a complete 180 flip, I’m an earnest guy now! I’m serious~
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Madara %}
Kanata-saaan? Sorry for interrupting your chatter, but could you come over here for a second?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata v2 %}
yes? what’s wrong…? is there trouble afoot?[^1]

i will do anything as an apology for causing trouble to everyone.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Madara %}
Nah, there’s just something I want you to see. I thought it was about time I finished off one of the objectives behind this live show I made us do.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Souma %}
…? The plan is to help the aquariums’ business by calling over an audience with a live show, is it not?

I have been working with all my might with that in mind.

If we are to make the business flourish, then there will be no reason to let go of the aquarium. The problem will be fundamentally solved this way, will it not?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Madara %}
Yeah, we’ve still got that objective to complete. But it’s not like we can work full time here… No matter how good of a performance we put up, it’ll only be a temporary help to the business.

But besides that, there's something important Kanata-san needs to consider when thinking about his own future. Kanata-san, take a good look at the seats over there~♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata v2 %}
over there…? oh, it’s rei and wataru.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Wataru %}
Ah! Kanata looked over here!

Kanata~! My dear old friend! The splashes amplify your divine glow! *Amazing*…☆
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Rei %}
Nevermind that, Hibiki-kun, the doves within your clothes seem to be moving about everywhere…

Are they perhaps hungry? They do not feed on fish, though, do they?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Sora %}
HaHa\~♪ There’s been an unusually strange color drifting in the air for awhile now\~ Maybe it’s because of that?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Wataru %}
Hm? Aahh, I can hear a peculiar sound when I listen closely… Could this be the dolphin’s singing?

That sound is visible to you? How wonderful! ♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Sora %}
Aaaahh, this is Mr. Dolphin’s singing? It’s a lovely color\~! *La\~di\~la\~!* ♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Hinata %}
Ahaha, you’re so lucky~ I wanna hear it too. Are you able to hear it, Hibiki-senpai? Is there some trick to it?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Wataru %}
Hmm… Focusing your hearing sense on something for a brief moment can be difficult. But anyone could do it to some extent with enough training.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Hinata %}
Ah! Then please teach me sometime! I mean, it’s probably best I try to pick up that skill, since I’m an idol!
{% endbubble %}

## Chapter 3

{% bubble Rei %}
Hush now. Do not frolic about; you should be listening to their song.

Well, it is up to each person how they want to enjoy a live show… However, as someone who is an idol, I imagine that it would feel terrible if the guests were idly chatting instead of paying attention to the song.

Perhaps this kind of awareness is also something that comes from one’s field of work. You become unable to have a more objective viewpoint of these things, so it has its merits and its demerits.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata v2 %}
fufufu, they look like they are having much more fun than i thought they would.

thank goodness. i hope that they were able to enjoy themselves after coming all the way over here, instead of feeling like they only wasted their time…

i am so happy that we were brought together here.

the five eccentrics are supposed to have drifted apart from each other, but we still have our friendship.

that makes me happy. i have always considered everyone as my friends.

rei~! wataru~! are you watching me? i am truly happy right now~♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Madara %}
Yeah, they’re important too, but I meant to look a little bit to the right… Look, it’s the people from your household.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata v2 %}
wah— you are right. they look different from how they look at home, so i did not notice them.

they seem like regular people when they look like that way, don’t they?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Madara %}
Heheh. Everyone puts on a mask at festivals, so even gods can blend in.

During these moments when people look the same and aren’t their usual selves, they interact with and talk to each other, growing fond of one another. That's why I love festivals.

We’re not like other people. But *here*, we can be happy just like everyone else.

Now, Kanata-san… Show your smile to your household—to your family.

Let them know that you’re fine, that you're living happily as an idol… Show them that you feel that way, to give them peace of mind.

You’re their hope. Their dreams, their happiness—All of it. After all, you’re their god.

That's why they become uneasy when you start being gloomy…

This time around, you started saying selfish things to them, and your feelings clashed with theirs…

So that must’ve made them really worried. That’s exactly why you need to show them with pride that you’re okay right now.

It’s probably rough to be treated like a god when you just want to be human, but… Having faith in God is a strong emotion similar to love, and not getting anything in return for their love probably makes them feel left out.

So your most important duty in all of this is to meet that need. That would do for now.

We have long lives ahead of us, so you can take your time thinking about what to do after this.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata v2 %}
do not act like you know any better… just how long do you plan to meddle with my affairs like you are my guardian?

well… i suppose i can understand what you are trying to say. i am sorry that things always end up this way… mama.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Madara %}
Oh, c’mon~ All I want is for you to blast through trivial problems such as this, so that you can go back to joining Ryuseitai’s activities.

I think Chiaki-san is gonna get a really bad stomach ache from worry if things don’t get settled soon.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata v2 %}
…so he really was worried about this?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Madara %}
Yeah, so much that it startled me. He’s the type to be way too mindful and considerate about things, so you should properly tell him everything to ease his mind.

He’s not ashamed of losing, but of being unable to fight. If he doesn’t know what’s going on, he can’t involve himself in it, nor can he fight.

He could be the most brilliant hero ever, but he would still be unable to do anything because of that.

The hardest thing for him is probably when he can only sit by and watch what happens.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata v2 %}
yes, i know… i do hope for a day when i can tell him about it…

but it is still too difficult to do that right now. ryuseitai is finally shining in the ideal way chiaki has dreamed of.

things are looking very good for ryuseitai right now… so i would feel terrible if that radiance clouds over because of me.

but someday… when that day comes… i will shout out “save me, hero!” from the bottom of my heart.

when that happens, i am sure that chiaki would gladly come rushing for me.

for the sake of that day… i will clear through all these problems immediately and come back home to everyone, so that chiaki would not abandon me.

i will come back to where i belong, as a human.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kaoru %}
Kanata-kuuun, does that mean you don't see the Marine Life club as somewhere you belong?

That’s so cold~ Did you hear that, Souma-kun? Kanata-kun said Ryuseitai is the only place he belongs~♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Souma %}
What? Buchou-dono~ What are we lacking? I am ashamed of myself—If there is anything you would like us to change, then please tell me!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata v2 %}
t-that is not what i said! you bully, kaoru~
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kaoru %}
Hahaha, let me crack some jokes for all the trouble you’ve caused me.

…Anyway, I think we’re gonna get tired really soon, so how about we end this with a song we sing all together?

I mean, we’re going around the aquarium with everyone after this, so let’s quickly get rid of the tedious parts and enjoy life with only the fun stuff~♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata v2 %}
yes, i am also hoping that we will be able to do that.

everyone together now\~! let us sing together with high spirits! we will sing our ensemble in unison\~♪

this is the gentle planet earth![^2] we are all family, born on this planet!

we will help each other, love each other, and sing a happy song!

we will sing together! and i hope, forever…♪

## Translation Notes
[^1]: The original line for “is there trouble afoot” is 何か問題発生ですか (nanika mondai hassei desuka), which is a phrase Chiaki says in his ! era home screen (he says it without *desu* though), except Kanata is using it here.
[^2]: Kanata calls “planet Earth” as 水の惑星 (mizu no wakusei). This isn’t the typical way to refer to Earth in Japanese (that would be *chikyuu*), and is also part of the original Ryusei Blue line (which was revealed in a Chiaki sub story, and can also be seen in [Boarding Live](https://ensemble-stars.fandom.com/wiki/Boarding_Live)). A literal translation would be "water planet."</ref>
