## Chapter 1

{% img Aquarium What Dream Shall We Be Seeing Together 1.png %}

{% note location %}
**Location:** Aquarium Stage
{% endnote %}

{% bubble Warning %}
Sexual harrassment within.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata %}
♪~♪~♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Wataru %}
Oh my, what’s this? It seems the live show has already started! No wonder there was no one in the standby room!

Kanata~ Your voice is as wonderful as always…☆
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Rei %}
No, this is simply the rehearsal for the show, is it not? They are not even wearing their outfits yet…

Although since this was an unplanned live, perhaps they do not have outfits prepared.

It should still be alright to chat with him if we keep it short. I want to greet him at least, although I am somewhat disinclined to walk on slippery floors.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata %}
Rei, Wataru… What are you doing here? You two being together is very unusual~
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Rei %}
No, no, you should not be asking that. Is it not obvious that I dragged my old bones all the way here out of worry for you?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata %}
Oh, I see… I really do need to reflect on the trouble I have caused.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Rei %}
Perhaps. But there is no need to fret over it so much. We came here on our own will.

It is not like you have caused us any trouble, either. This all happened by chance. These children are only here because they came to the aquarium to have fun.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Sora %}
Yes! Today was very fun! Sora got to see lots and lots of new things!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Hinata %}
Umm… I see Anzu-san crouching down in the corner over there… Is she okay?

Is it because there aren’t enough helping hands for the live show… like, not enough advertisement? Should we help?

Whenever Anzu-san isn’t looking upbeat, the reason is pretty much always work-related.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Madara %}
Hahaha, no worries, no worries. Everything’s going perfectly splendid for the show.

You guys can relax and enjoy the show as our audience.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Rei %}
No, no… Mikejima-kun, I cannot even fathom how this entire situation could have turned into a live show performance in the first place.

How many times must I tell you that your habit of turning everything into a boisterous festival is terrible?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Souma %}
Hrm… I do not think any of us here can comprehend what is occuring at the moment, except for Mikejima-dono. He dragged all of us into this without any prior explanation.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Madara %}
*<nowiki/>'Tis my utter folly!* I can’t say you’re wrong for calling me out on that, but just trust me on this and follow along!

It’ll be fine, just fine! Everything will surely end in success!

Also, you don’t need to worry about Anzu-san. She fell into the pool a second ago, so she’s completely drenched.

But there’s not a single scratch on her, so don’t worry.

It’s all thanks to Kaoru-san, who swiftly came to her rescue. Anzu-san, you practically owe him your life now, okay?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kaoru %}
Ahaha, I really panicked there… I could tell she was wobbling about as she walked, but then she flopped down right into the pool.

I think she accidentally tripped over herself…

But then I didn’t see her resurface out of the water, so I had to dive in there and save her.

I’ve done some part-time jobs like that, so I know the basics of how to be a lifeguard.

Hmm, but maybe I was a little too quick to do that… If she had drowned and lost consciousness, I would’ve had an excuse to kiss her~♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Madara %}
Hahaha, that’s a shame. She owes you one, so she ought to let you kiss her at least…

She’s stiff as always.

Hmm…? She’s feeling all ashamed, saying “today really is a bad day for me…”

Is that why you’re in the corner, looking like you can’t stand being here for any second longer, Anzu-san…?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Souma %}
Hehe, be slow and steady, Anzu-dono.[^1] You should take a relaxing break.

The more you exhaust yourself, the more you will cause *“care-less mis-staiks”* to happen… Not only that, but you will be less mindful of your surroundings. It is not a pleasant experience.

Hasumi-dono is occasionally reduced to such a state from overexhaustion, so I am well aware of this fact.

Pushing yourself to work even harder when you are in that state only worsens your health, as well as your work productivity.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata %}
Yes… So how about we all go around the aquarium together once this live show is over?

Let’s forget about work and take a nice breather…

It *is* everyone’s holiday, after all… It would be a shame if it ends in waste because of me.

I would feel a bit terrible if that were to happen.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kaoru %}
Everyone’s doing this ‘cause they want to, you know? But if I get to go around the aquarium with Anzu-chan, then I can finally have the date of my dreams, so I’m up for it~♪

This was just the worst type of ending, what with time being lost thanks to us taking forever to group up after losing eachother…

But next chance I get, I’ll totally make it enjoyable for her. I swear I will~♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Rei %}
Hmm, so you had your own mess of a day, too… Am I correct, Kaoru-kun?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kaoru %}
Yeeep, I ended up sweating way too much over everything. Man, this is all I’ve been doing lately…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Rei %}
*Kukuku.* But you seem to be getting a lot of good out of it, because your expressions look better than when we first met.

Nothing is better than enjoying youth to its fullest, and you seem to be doing just that. Likewise, not having everything go your way is also a part of life~♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kaoru %}
Ehh… I prefer doing a bit more of the juicy stuff so I can just enjoy myself.

But things just don’t work out that way… All these guys around me are a handful, after all.
{% endbubble %}

## Chapter 2

{% img Aquarium What Dream Shall We Be Seeing Together 2.png %}

{% note location %}
**Location:** Aquarium Stage
{% endnote %}

{% bubble Kaoru %}
Uh-oh. Anzu-chan, you’re getting cold from being drenched, aren’t you? You’re sneezing.

Let’s head over to the shop together! We’ll buy a towel and a change of clothes~♪

C’mon, stand up. Cheer up, okay? You’ll be alright.

You’ve been doing as great as you ever could. This Onii-san right here will assure you of that! Good girl, good girl~♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Hinata %}
Oh! If you want something from the shop, then I’ll rush over there by myse--Mrrpfh!?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Rei %}
Do not worry about it, just leave this to Kaoru-kun. It is we who are the guests today; we should not be intruding in on them.

Now then, let us head over to the audience seats~♪

There does not seem to be much time until the show starts, so you must hurry… Alright, Kaoru-kun?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kaoru %}
Gotcha. Alright, let’s get going, Anzu-chan! Let’s hold hands as we walk there~♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Souma %}
…They have left. Is it truly alright to leave Anzu-dono with that man…? Is it not possible that he will leave with her?

Shall I accompany them just in case?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata %}
Souma, you should practice a little more for the live show.

You are very good at singing and dancing, but this show will have a dolphin performance in it, so you have to get along with the dolphins.

Generally, most of it will be dealt with by the aquarium staff.

But just in case anything happens, you should learn how to work with them, too. I will teach you all about it.

Look, the dolphins have come over to us…

They are very smart children, but they are also timid. Treat them gently, so as not to scare them away.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Souma %}
Oohh. This is the first time I have seen *“dol-fins”* up close. I did not expect them to have such atrocious rows of teeth…

But it feels like their eyes have a gentle feel to them… It is vaguely similar to Buchou-dono’s.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata %}
Oh, really? Well, I do suppose you would not be used to seeing them, since we cannot keep any in our water tanks.

That is exactly why we need this aquarium.

I want to protect it. This time… I will definitely protect what is important to me. I really am just talking about this case.
{% endbubble %}

{% note location %}
**Location:** Aquarium (Main Exhibition)
{% endnote %}

{% img (The Sea and You) Kaoru Hakaze CG.png %}

{% bubble Kaoru %}
Look, Anzu-chan! Look over there! There’s an interesting display of fish over there~♪

It looks like like they put all the big crabs and deep-sea fish and any other sci-fi-ish sea creatures in there, so it’s like you’ve *“Stepped into a planet completely different from Earth,”* or so it says.

I think no one’s been approaching it, probably because it’s kinda eerie.

So if we go over there, we may get to be all alone together~ Wanna go and see?

Ahhh…! It’s like we’re space travellers drifting into an unknown planet…!!

We could live here, as we support and help each other while in danger of monsterous creatures on this planet…! And then, our love will bloom…♪

Heheh, let’s become this planet’s Adam and Eve, Anzu-chan! ♪

Huh? We should just hurry up already?

It’ll be fine, won’t it? I’m not part of the main show this time, so they can start without me if we don’t make it in time.

I don’t even want to work today, it’s a holiday… We’ll go back to them sometime in the middle of the show, sooo~ I’m gonna keep you for myself for a while…♪

Ah! Don’t run off with a stunned look on your face!

Did you forget that the reason today went badly was because of that~? I think it’d be a good idea to think less about work every once in awhile, don’t you?

People aren’t meant to put work above all else, you know?

Well, nowadays you get rewarded for working hard, so I guess everyone has been putting their all into it.

I mean, having your hard work recognized and accomplishing things can be nice, after all.

But that’s why I think it’s risky for you to do this… It’s really easy to get obsessed with the idea of working hard for satisfaction if you continue to do it.

Then you’ll get so addicted to it you won’t be able to notice when your body can’t take it anymore, and you may end up in tatters before you know it.

I don’t want you to turn out that way.

……Yep, I’m lecturing you like an elder.

It *could* be nice for someone to live a short but fulfilling life, and it *could* satisfy them in the end… But everyone they leave behind wouldn’t be able to handle it. So take care of your health, and live as long as you can.

It’s easy to forget this when we’re all living in this peaceful country, but… People do die, you know?

Don’t die on us… Okay? You’re very important to everyone, Anzu-chan.

…… Ahaha, this isn’t the moment to talk so seriously… I mean, you’re wearing a T-shirt with dumb-looking octopuses and squids on it~♪

I know you had to change your clothes after getting drenched, but out of all the shirts in the shop, why did you choose that one? There were plenty of other ones, weren’t there?

Shops nowadays don’t just have those unfashionable shirts that are usually bought as a souvenir, they also have fashionable ones you can buy for everyday use, don’t they?

Huh? “Do I look weird”? Ahaha~ You really thought you’d look good in it?

It’s like your fashion sense is still in it’s baby phase, that’s *sooo* cute~♪

Owowow! Don’t hit me~ Sorry, I went too far! I think it looks good! Octopuses and squids are just fine!

Everyone has their own fashion sense, so anything goes so long as it suits them, yeah?

Actually, wait-- Can I take a picture with you? I feel I could burst out in laughter if I could keep looking at it~!

Ah—wait wait, come back!

Sorry, sorry, I teased you way too much. It’s okay, you look fine! It’s adorable, Anzu-chan~♪

(Ahaha. Good, good… I think she cheered up a little. It really doesn’t suit her to be upset~)

(She’s probably been really busy lately and making mistakes as she gets more and more tired. I’m guessing that’s what ended up making her cry…)

(You know, I really do want good people to always be smiling.)

(… Mom, I'll be a good kid too, so could I also smile and laugh more?)
{% endbubble %}

## Chapter 3

{% img Aquarium What Dream Shall We Be Seeing Together 3.png %}

{% note location %}
**Location:** Aquarium Stage
{% endnote %}

{% bubble Kaoru %}
I’m baaack~♪ The live show hasn’t started yet, right?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Souma %}
You are late! I almost thought you had escaped! Just where were you, and what were you doing!?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata %}
Now, now, Souma… Welcome back, Kaoru. It looks like you came back wearing the costume, yes?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kaoru %}
Yeah, more or less~ As soon as I came back, Sakuma-san and the others hoisted me right into the dressing room, and then wrapped me up in this costume like I’m some dress-up doll.

Anyway, I’d look like an idiot if I were the only one wearing casual clothes while everyone else wore costumes for the show.

But this show came out of nowhere, so weren’t we just talking about how we probably won’t get any special costumes for it?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata %}
That is right. But Wataru was able to provide some for us.

It seems that he was able to spot an association from a nearby theater doing a public performance at the perfect time.

He has connections with them, so he asked them to lend him some costumes as a favor.

But these costumes were not made for us, so we must make some adjustments to the size.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kaoru %}
Ahhh… So that’s why Anzu-chan has her sewing box out and is clamoring about like her moment has finally come.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Souma %}
Ahaha, Anzu-dono, that tickles.

I would rather you not fumble with my costume… I think it is best that you adjust Mikejima-dono’s outfit instead of mine, no? He seems cramped in his costume.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Madara %}
Yep, please and thank you! Honestly, I’d be able to move about to an extent even if my limbs were somehow all tied up, so you don’t really have to be precise with the adjustments.

Anyway, there’ll be quite a lot of water splashing onto us during the performance… I’m probably worried over nothing, but just in case, you should make your clothes waterproof.

Here, Souma-san, I’ll do you the honor of coating you in the waterproof spray~♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Souma %}
Cease at once! It would be a great deal of pain if it were to come into my eyes! I can do it myself!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kaoru %}
Ahaha, Mikejima-kun got himself on Souma-kun’s good side before we knew it.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata %}
Hehe, it looks like he has taken a huge liking to Souma ever since Wisteria Festival long ago…

Souma often complains about how he would come and pester him over every little thing.

And since Souma is a good boy, he cannot be cold-hearted to someone who treats him intimately.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kaoru %}
Haha, I see. Mikejima-kun has peculiar taste, doesn’t he? It feels like he’s always involving himself with the weird kids.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata %}
It is because that rogue has always liked old-fashioned things, and Souma excites him for that reason.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kaoru %}
He’s a samurai of the old ages, so it makes sense~ Wait-- Kanata-kun, you’re talking like you know all about him. Were you two that close?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata %}
Hm… His father is a high-ranking police officer, you see. So his father would often come to my house for inspection.

Sooo… I would see him often as well. It has been like that since long ago.

We would play together while the adults talked to each other, since we were the same age.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kaoru %}
Ahh, that’s right, Mikejima-kun’s parents are police officers.

I could tell he has influential power, but wow… your own parents being part of the police force already makes you sound like a hero of justice.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Madara %}
Ahh, no, it’s not both my parents, just my dad. My mom actually used to be someone who went against society… She’s retired now, though.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kaoru %}
Wait what? What do you mean by that? Was she a terrorist? Part of the yakuza?

How did someone like that marry a police officer!? I can smell a romantic story~♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Madara %}
You like stuff like that, huh… But I can’t really tell you more about their love story, since I don’t know much about it myself.

Anyway, since I’m still a kid, I try to ask for help from my parents whenever I hit an area I can’t deal with.

By using the power of the state and the power of the underground, most things end up working out somehow.

I do want to work things out with my own power, though… It’d be pathetic to keep relying on your own parents’ power, you know?

But Kanata-san’s household is an unusual case, so I used every card in my hand.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata %}
Is it really that unusual…? I *did* understand the fact that I am different from others.

But to me, this was always the norm.

I am always confused whenever people tell me “that is so weird” or “you poor thing.”

And I am on good terms with my household, so I am not really that dissatisfied, you know?

It is just… The gods has been falling out of power lately. So it seems like my household’s power has weakened.

And that is when my household decided to let go of this aquarium they own.
{% endbubble %}

## Chapter 4

{% img Aquarium What Dream Shall We Be Seeing Together 4.png %}

{% note location %}
**Location:** Aquarium Stage
{% endnote %}

{% bubble Kaoru %}
So your household owns this aquarium, huh? I never knew that~ I’ve always just gone to it because it’s nearby.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata %}
Hehe, long ago, I had seen someone who looked a lot like you, Kaoru.

You would walk around in the aquarium holding hands with a very pretty woman, yes?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kaoru %}
Ahh, yeah… My mom really liked fish and stuff.

Whenever she was feeling better, she’d secretly take me here after I’d been pooped out from all the studying and lessons.

So this place holds a looot of important memories to me. If it goes bankrupt because of bad business, it’ll feel like something’s missing.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Souma %}
Hm, it is going to go bankrupt? What a shame. Even though it seems to be prospering so well right now.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata %}
Ah, no. It seems like it will be bought by some company. But that company does not have a very good reputation.

So I became anxious about whether the fish would be taken care of properly or not…

Also, they have a business of reselling lands, so what they truly want is this land.

If they cannot make profit from the aquarium, then there is a chance that they will demolish it.

By doing so, they may be able to make something that will bring more revenue.

But I did not want that.

So I said selfish things, begging them not to sell it, please don’t…

That is when I started to advertise for the aquarium, to keep the business going.

Like buying the tickets with my own money, and handing them out to people.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Souma %}
Ahh, I finally understand the reason behind those strange things you were doing, Buchou-dono. However, is it not futile to try and do it with only your power?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata %}
You are right. My household also sympathized with how I feel…

And we made it an objective to work hard, and not let go of the aquarium.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Madara %}
They’re softer on you than one would expect. Throwing a tantrum usually doesn’t get things through, you know?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata %}
Yes, it is because I am a very, very important living God. People would yield to me in most cases.

Well, it is also thanks to the pressure you put on them, though. In this time period, the God’s position is weak.

If a higher-up keeps a strong eye on him, he will perish away immediately… So please try not to bully him, okay?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Madara %}
Hrm… I do think I was a bit rash, but your wish was for this aquarium to stay as it is, right?

Then I want to support that with all I’ve got, as your friend.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata %}
You went too far with that “support,” mama.

It is the God’s duty to heal and protect everybody. He cannot cause trouble to them like this.

It is too late to say “I think I’ll quit after all” now, anyway… So I will push through with it.

I have to make sure I never say anything selfish ever again.

I really never wanted to bother anyone… Yet it ended up being a bigger problem than I thought it would… I will do better next time.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Madara %}
That just shows how dearly everyone thinks of you, Kanata-san.

Not because you’re a God… It’s because you’re *you* that everyone wanted to help you.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata %}
Huh… This is all strange to me… I have never even gotten involved with anyone in my life before…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Souma %}
It is only you who sees it that way, Buchou-dono. At the very least *I* am indebted to you. I would love to assist you if you are ever in trouble.

All that I ask is that you consult me about it much sooner. You are being a little *too* reserved, are you not?

It takes a lot of energy to undo a problem after it has already gotten so complicated.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata %}
I am so sorry, Souma. I am sorry to you too, Kaoru, and to everyone else…

I have never been selfish before, until now. So I am not really good at it.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kaoru %}
Yeah, the way you were acting for this case is like a spoiled kid whining and demanding that things go their way.

Ahaha, it’s pretty much just like a baby going against their parents for the first time.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata %}
Yes… But this is a strange feeling. I had always restrained myself up until this point. It is almost always peaceful so long as I restrain myself.

But in Yumenosaki, everyone is trying to make their own dreams come true with everything they have.

Even if it was their own selfish desires… That is why I wanted to do the same.

I am not used to it, and so I cannot do it properly. But this time, I followed how I feel to the very end…

And it feels like things will work out someway or another, so I am a bit happy.

If it were me from the past, then after getting locked up in the water tank as punishment and cooling my head down with some thinking… I would just have thought it did not matter anymore.

My household also probably thought that by punishing me, I would regret my actions, and be a good kid.

Actually, when I was all alone inside that water tank, I did start thinking about how dumb I was acting, and I thought of giving up altogether…

But then everyone came here for me. And then you helped me to the best that you could.

Without ever rejecting me, you supported and aided me.

It made me so happy. That is why I will not restrain myself this time.

Even if it is something embarrassing and childishly selfish, I will make my own dream come true.

Just like what everyone else is doing.

Because I am not a God, but now the same human being as everyone else.

## Translation Notes
[^1]: The original line for “Slow and steady” is 急がず焦らず (isogazu aserazu), which is a phrase Kanata commonly says (it’s even one of his voice clips), except Souma is using it here.
