## Chapter 1

<div class="msr-narration">
    <p>Half a year later. Middle of March, in ES’s first year of establishment…</p>
</div>

{% img /img/es/eventstory/supervillain/darkstarch1_1.jpg %}

{% bubble Chiaki v2 %}
The worldbuilding of the new show, Super Villains, seems to have finally been set in stone!

The decision looks to be absolutely confirmed this time for sure.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shinobu sigh %}
Oh, it finally has? It has become such a sensitive case that I thought it was cursed. I never imagined it to be *this* messy when we first accepted the request to appear on the show.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki frown %}
Yeah. The show had changed directors, scriptwriters, and various other staff members multiple times, and each time it happened, the content was fundamentally changed, too.

The one thing that was admirable about it was its ambition to make a blockbuster that would go down in the history of the tokusatsu world, and that did make me have very high hopes for it…

But after actually delving into it, I realized it’s turned out to be a terrible project. I won’t be surprised if they bury it in the ground as a dark time for them, due to all the disputes that led to lawsuits, among other problems.

How did it come to this?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shinobu awkward %}
Haha… I knew from the very beginning that there would be some trouble with the rights to the show, to be honest.

Nonetheless, this blockbuster in which various famous heroes, whether local or overseas, gather to fight…

Am I right to assume that the title of said project has been confirmed to be “Super Villains”?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki v2 %}
Yup! At first, even the title kept changing, from “Comet-something” to “Superhero-something” to some other variations.

But they finally removed the “tentative” disclaimer from the title in the documents.

So yes, I think it’s safe to say that the title is at least finalized now.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shinobu frown %}
There is not much time left until its release in spring, yet the title is only just now confirmed? That is freaking nuts.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata v2 %}
yes~ it is freaking nuts~♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki serious %}
Kanata, no! You shouldn’t use slang words like that. Little kiddos will copy after you.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata worried %}
wha~? i was simply [copying] what shinobu said, though…? so it is fine when he says it?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki v2 %}
Yeah, because he’s cute.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata surprised %}
gwah~!? so i am not cute?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki frown %}
Don’t ask to be called cute with a stature as huge as yours.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata cry %}
uwaahh~! shinobuu… chiaki has been so cold lately…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shinobu v2 %}
There, there~ Don’t cry, Shinkai-dono. Don’t you worry, you’re adorable!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata worried %}
really? can i really believe that…?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shinobu v2 %}
Of course! Nothing has been going well lately, with only dissatisfactory results in the process, so even someone like Morisawa-dono must be getting frustrated by now.

I’m certain that deep down, he also thinks that you are the cutest in the whole universe!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata v2 %}
……(Looks at Chiaki with anticipation)
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki awkward %}
……(Pats Kanata’s head for now)

Right, so. We went extremely off-topic for a moment, but — Super Villains will feature all of Japan’s world-famous tokusatsu heroes.

That was part of the original plan, at least.

The characters that were going to appear were not only life-size transformable heroes, but also giant robots, monsters, and even comic book characters that were to have their first adaptation.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shinobu v2 %}
It’s like every fan’s dream: an all-star tokusatsu show.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki v2 %}
That’s what it was first advertised as.

There have been collaboration projects in the past with certain sets of heroes, but it was just for a one-time-only celebratory movie.

The plan this time, however, was to have a year-long super-interesting epic drama with a star-studded lineup of famous heroes.

The show wasn’t only going to get a movie, but also have multiple other shows broadcasted and distributed on the Internet and TV.

The project’s concept was the same as those movies with all the heroes from American comic books, but instead they were trying to do a local version.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata sigh %}
they were trying to catch a rare fish[^1], weren’t they?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki frown %}
Yeah… It was careless of them to try to fish up such a rare catch, but…

The production team had an unusually high budget, and various companies, including ES, invested in the project — so I felt that they were genuinely serious about it.

Plus, it was a dream project for me, as well. A blockbuster in which superheroes all across history would be active in every direction — just imagining it was enough to make me drool.

But in the end, it’s going to be a much more scaled-down show, though not entirely far from the ideal that they had.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shinobu sigh %}
Indeed. The companies that own the rights to the heroes who were scheduled to appear have been in constant dispute with each other, after all — but eventually, the plan just disintegrated.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata awkward %}
ahaha… it is as if the [dream] had to be [adjusted] in order to fit [reality], yes…?

no matter what, [reality] is never as [satisfactory] as a [dream].
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shinobu sigh %}
Indeed… In that sense, the SSVRS was a groundbreaking invention. It allows us to experience dreams as dreams.

I’m sure everyone would rather have a happy and convenient dream than an uncontrollable reality.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki v2 %}
But it’s the special effects of tokusatsu that turn a dream into a reality. Isn’t that right, Sengoku?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shinobu v2 %}
That is indeed true. I, too, had my dream become a reality for the first time thanks to that, but mostly because of Ryuseitai.

And that would be — by becoming a true ninja.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata v2 %}
by turning your [dream] into a [reality], yes? that is something chiaki has been doing since long ago.

if there are no heroes in this world, then *we* will become heroes.
{% endbubble %}

## Chapter 2

{% bubble Chiaki serious %}
Yeah… While we do tend to get beat up in the face of reality… That’s the sort of ambition we, Ryuseitai, are working under.

That’s exactly why we’re the one group that can’t, at any cost, abandon Super Villains, as it also has been suffering countless injuries in the face of reality.

This is a matter of our identity.

Or no, rather, it’s mine. I can’t force you guys to go along with my selfish desires…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shinobu v2 %}
I always think this, but you truly do not have to be so reserved, Morisawa-dono.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata v2 %}
exactly~ you heard him, chiaki. let’s [keep] the [water reservoirs] for me, only~♪

all for one, and one for all—
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki frown %}
But… that very premise for Ryuseitai has long been on the verge of collapse. Nagumo and Takamine haven’t at all been participating in our unit activities recently, for one thing.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shinobu thinking %}
They’re both absent today, too… Even though we told them beforehand that we’d have a meeting.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata idle %}
mm~ i believe midori may simply be [skipping] out on the meeting, but i do not think there is [much] we can do about tetora, is there? after all, things are like *that* for him right now.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shinobu frown %}
Ahh, indeed. It seems that Tetora-kun has found himself in an unforeseen position. I don’t know exactly how it happened, however.

But even if we are physically far apart, our hearts are always one. I’m certain it is. I believe in that!

Although, it seems like Midori-kun mainly can’t stand to participate in any Ryuseitai activities, and thus has been running away from them…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki serious %}
I’m sure Takamine doesn’t mean to run away, though.

When all five of us gather, the atmosphere becomes uncomfortable, and he likely doesn’t like that, so he’s been avoiding it altogether.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata sigh %}
ah~ yes, midori has that side to him…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shinobu sad %}
Were this the past, Morisawa-dono would drag Midori-kun over by the collar like he always would, but…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki frown %}
Yeah… I’m not sure I can emotionally handle that kind of thing right now.
{% endbubble %}

{% img /img/es/eventstory/supervillain/darkstarch2_1.jpg %}

{% bubble Chiaki v2 %}
Anyway, during the time Comet Show happened, we agreed to appear in the tokusatsu show that is now called “Super Villains”.

Therefore, it would be against my sense of duty to leave now. And personally, I want to give it my all and see through the end, as well.

It’s in a pretty dire state, but it’s still a dream show for me.

Though, due to the show’s content being changed multiple times, all the practice we’ve put in will probably be for naught…

Apparently, even the scripts that were prepared for the show have all been rejected and will be rewritten.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shinobu sigh %}
We had been rehearsing our scenes according to the script, though…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki serious %}
Yeah… That’s unfortunately going to have been a waste of our time, since it looks like they’re going to reassign the cast and all.

We’re contractually obligated to perform at some point, but I still don’t know what kind of roles we’ll be cast in yet.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shinobu v2 %}
I would like to be casted as a ninja.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata v2 %}
i love [fish]~♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki v2 %}
Mhm, I’ve already made our wishes known to them. So… I’d like to think that it’s unlikely that we’ll be given an unreasonable role.
{% endbubble %}

{% img /img/es/eventstory/supervillain/darkstarch2_2.jpg %}

{% bubble Chiaki sad %}
But the content is… Well, I’m a little anxious about it, to say the least.

There’s a chance our character titles in the show won’t be “heroes”.

It means that we might be cast in a role that wouldn’t reflect well on us, the idol-hero unit.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shinobu %}
To be honest, I feel as though only you are particular about that, Morisawa-dono. Regardless… Erm, does that mean that we might end up playing villains depending on how the script turns out?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki idle %}
About that… All the heroes in Super Villains are actually supposed to be villains in the story.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata curious %}
…? …? they are heroes, but they are evil? what does that even mean…?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki idle %}
I haven’t properly examined all the documentation on its worldbuilding to fully understand it yet, either.

But I heard that justice and evil are reversed in the story’s world, due to some sort of final boss that appears in the story.

The world within Super Villains is ruled by evil. In there, justice becomes evil and evil becomes justice.

The heroes in the story are predestined to be hunted as evil in that world.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shinobu v2 %}
Ah, that actually sounds interesting! Wow, so it involves people who are meant to be righteous heroes, but are actually considered villains in that world…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki v2 %}
Yep. For us viewers who are outside of that world, the tokusatsu heroes are obviously the ones who are on the side of justice.

But in the story, they are treated as evil.

Normally, when a hero appears, the general public applauds them, but in the world of Super Villains, they scream in fear.

The protagonist of the story will be the very first hero in a world where values have been overturned, when they realize that something is wrong about their world.

The protagonist then helps other heroes who are being hunted as evil in other areas, and then they fight together to defeat the root of the evil that’s causing the world to go mad.

That’s the basic plot of the story.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shinobu v2 %}
In a sense, it’s good versus evil, through and through. Showing good in a world where evil rules.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki thinking %}
Yeah… But while the gist of the story has been decided, there seems to be yet another dispute over how it will be presented.

Depending on what scenario they choose, one of them will be that the heroes become tainted with evil to the core and cause havoc and mayhem.

Then, when the heroes become fully evil, the protagonist beats them to get rid of the brainwash, and brings them back to their senses.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata curious %}
they get fixed by being hit? they are like [electronics] from the olden days.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shinobu thinking %}
Hmm… In that case, the setting where the world values are inverted is no longer relevant, and it will simply be the trope of a righteous person having an “evil era”.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki frown %}
That would be visually easier to understand, after all. They’ve made an overly-optimistic calculation that figurines and toys for the “Villain Version” might also sell.

But… I don’t know how I feel about depicting the hero, who should be a perfectly righteous existence for children, as being tainted with evil.

Of course, evil Kamen Riders, evil Ultramen, and various others alike already do exist, I’m well aware that they’re popular.

But what the kids — No, what *I* want to see are cool, virtuous heroes.
{% endbubble %}

## Chapter 3

{% bubble Midori v2 %}
You’re having a weird tokusatsu talk again…

It’s embarrassing being seen with you whenever you do that, so could you stop…? I’ll be mistaken for a nerd…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shinobu surprised %}
Eep, Midori-kun!?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki grin %}
Takamine! You little rascal~ You’re late! ♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata v2 %}
fufu, you have not been [showing] up lately, so we have been [worried] about you, you know?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori sad %}
I’m sorry Shinkai-senpai, sorry Shinobu-kun… I couldn’t stand to read messages sent from anyone in Ryuseitai, so I couldn’t bring myself to check the chat until the very last minute…

I got the courage to check just a moment ago, and rushed here as soon as I found out it’s a meeting… <em>Sigh</em>, I broke a sweat for no reason…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki v2 %}
I know I sound insistent by constantly saying this, but you need to be more diligent about checking business-related messages! Promise your Taichou[^2] that!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori sad %}
Ha, ha… “Taichou,” is it…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki v2 %}
Hm? Don’t mumble, tell me what you want to say clearly!

I’ll accept anything you tell me.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori angry %}
Hmph… Maybe *you’d* be fine with it, but as for the insect crashing into you—
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shinobu v2 %}
M-Midori-kun? How about you take a seat next to me for now? ♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata v2 %}
i will go make us [tea]~♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori worried %}
Um, I have a solo job coming up soon, so if you aren’t talking about anything important, then I’d be glad if you could send me the gist of it later…

I just showed up as part of my duty as a unit member… I kinda wanna avoid meeting up with everyone in Ryuseitai as much as possible, but I also don’t wanna be scolded, so…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata curious %}
midori, it sounds like your [schedule] has been tightly packed lately, hasn’t it?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki worried %}
Yeah… It’s good to keep yourself busy, but are you alright? You’ll hurt yourself if you keep on working nonstop, y’know? Are you sure you aren’t overdoing it?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori sigh %}
No… I think I’m closer to breaking down emotionally rather than physically, so I’ve been keeping myself busy to get my mind off things…

I know it makes no sense… I don’t get myself, either… I mean, *I’m* the one who wanted it to be this way.

Everything’s turning out exactly as I wanted it, so I get that I shouldn’t be throwing a tantrum…

But to be completely honest with you all, it’s practically impossible for me to do Ryuseitai activities right now.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki serious %}
Don’t misunderstand, Takamine.

You did nothing wrong. So you don’t need to fret yourself over any of this.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori angry %}
There you go again; it’s ‘cause you *never* let us bear *any* of that burden that—
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shinobu surprised %}
—Mm, mm!!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori sad %}
Ah, sorry, it got tense again… It’s really painful to see, right…

I’m not a kid, so I know that…

I know that nobody’s in the wrong, nobody’s at fault… I know that we just need to suck it up and accept the situation, and keep on going with our heads held high…

But I just can’t switch gears that easily…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shinobu worried %}
N-No, not that! Look at this news article that was posted right now…!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori worried %}
Shinobu-kun, you’ve been looking at your phone instead of paying attention to our important conversation…?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shinobu worried %}
N-No, no, of course I was listening! But you see, I asked Yuuki-dono to install a certain app for me, since he’s extremely knowledgeable of electronics—

So I now have a way to automatically compile all information about Ryuseitai on the internet, from all sorts of places.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori sigh %}
You can check that kinda stuff just fine, huh… I could never… any post I read on social media ends up stuck in my head for days, whether it’s a compliment or slander…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shinobu v2 %}
Heh! It is a ninja’s duty to excel at intellectual gathering!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata v2 %}
you just keep being more and more [reliable] lately, shinobu~ good boy, good boy~♪
{% endbubble %}

{% img /img/es/eventstory/supervillain/darkstarch3_1.jpg %}

{% bubble Shinobu v2 %}
Ehehe~

…Wait, this isn’t the time! You have to look at this!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori sigh %}
What…? Is it more flaming ‘cause of the slander from Crazy:B…?

I know we managed to extinguish the fire by now, but once something’s been lit up, it’s easy for it to burst into flames again… They really did the worst damage to us in summer.

…Huh? What is this?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shinobu surprised %}
Gah—! Don’t lean over me, Midori-kun! You’re crushing me~!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori sad %}
Sorry, I’ll look at it on my phone… Ahh, wait, I muted words like “Ryuseitai” and “Takamine Midori”—…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shinobu v2 %}
T-Then let us read it together! Look, this is from a pretty huge news site, and I believe it should be relatively trustworthy—
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki curious %}
I’ll look at it from my phone. Let’s see here…

What the…!? What is this…!?

“Is Nagumo Tetora leaving Ryuseitai at long last!?” Leaving? What’s this about? Did anyone hear about this?

“After Nagumo leaves, he plans to become the leader of the new group, RB (Ryuseitai Black?)”

——What!? Whaaat!? What on <em>earth</em>…!? I haven’t heard anything about this…!

## Translation Notes
[^1]: This is originally referring to an idiom that goes, “you won't find a loach under the willow”, meaning just because you were lucky to succeed once, doesn't mean you'll succeed again with the same method.
[^2]: “Taichou” means leader.
