### With Kaoru

<div class="msr-location">
    <p><span><b>Location:</b> Classroom 3-A</span></p>
</div>

{% bubble Chiaki grin %}
Hmhmhm\~ Hmhmhmmm\~♪ <th>*(Humming)*</th>
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kaoru %}
You’re in a good mood, Morisawa-kun~ Did something nice happen to you?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki grin2 %}
Fuhahaha! I’m glad you asked, Hakaze!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kaoru frown2 %}
No, no, you *clearly* looked like you were waiting for someone to ask. It was practically impossible to ignore.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki grin2 %}
Mm! My bad! You see, my favorite tokusatsu show is getting a movie adaptation!

I wanted to share this wonderful news with someone, so I ended up humming for attention!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kaoru frown %}
Mm\~… Isn't it best to share that kinda stuff with someone who also likes tokusatsu? I don’t have any interest in it, y’know\~?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki grin %}
True, I could’ve, but I really couldn’t hold back my urge to tell someone straight away!

Hakaze, if anything nice happens to you too, feel free to tell me all about it! Even if I don’t know anything about the topic, I’ll be happy about it with you…☆
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kaoru awkward %}
Ahaha\~ Thanks. I think it’s nice that you’re that type of person, yeah\~
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki fist %}
Ooh! Thank *you!* Let’s get along some more, Hakaze! We’ll watch the movie together once it comes out!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kaoru nod2 %}
Yeah, no thanks. No way I’ll ever go to a movie with a guy~♪
{% endbubble %}

### With Tetora

<div class="msr-location">
    <p><span><b>Location:</b> Park</span></p>
</div>

{% bubble Chiaki fist %}
The red flame is the mark of justice! The sun of life, burning bright red! Ryusei Red! Morisawa Chiaki…!

You say yours too, Nagumo! …Ah! Did you forget it by any chance? Alright then, I’ll say it right now, so make sure to remember it!

The black flame is the mark of effort! The burning fighting spirit, stained with mud! Ryusei Black! Nagumo Tetora…!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora worried %}
Umm… Taichou? Sorry for askin’ while you’re at hyper-max excitement, but… Couldja tell me why you called us to the park?

You told us to come over here after class, but I only see the two of us in this park…
{% endbubble %}

<!-- fix this -->

{% bubble Chiaki grin2 %}
Mhm, I’ve honestly got no clue where Kanata is, but Sengoku said he’d come, so he should be here soon.

As for the reason I called you all here… It’s so that we could perform a hero show. And also to practice our catchphrases!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora yare %}
Ahh, right, you want us to gather a crowd of kids again. But before I came here, Midori-kun told me somethin’ during class…

He said he won’t be able to come 'cuz he has to work at his family’s greengrocer.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki worried %}
Hold on, I wasn’t informed about this…? But this means that me, you, and Sengoku are the only ones who’ll perform…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki grin %}
Well, no matter. Hardships are an inevitability for heroes! By overcoming them, you become qualified to call yourself one!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki smilesoft %}
Oh! Here comes Sengoku. And the children are here, too. Now that we have our guests, we should start our hero show!
{% endbubble %}

### With Shu

<div class="msr-location">
    <p><span><b>Location:</b> Handicrafts Clubroom</span></p>
</div>

{% bubble Chiaki angrycloseup %}
Itsuki, are you in here…!?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shu glare %}
*Non!* Knock before you come in!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki worried %}
Sorry, sorry. The thing is, I've been looking for you because I have something to ask of you.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shu glare %}
Something to ask of me…? Hmph, this isn’t going to be something frivolous, is it?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki %}
No, see… One of the Ryuseitai uniforms has started to come apart. Could you fix it for me, please?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shu v2 %}
I heard your uniforms were made by Kiryu. Shouldn’t you ask him, instead?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki sighfrown %}
I’d love to, but… He wasn’t in the dojo, nor in his classroom… I think he’s gone home.

We have a hero show planned for tomorrow, so I need it fixed as soon as possible…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki worried %}
I’ll pay you, of course. I know I’m asking for a lot, but could you fix it by today? Please! I’m begging you!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shu yare %}
Raise your head. You’ll likely remain here until I say yes, and that would cause me far more trouble. I will agree only this once.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki smileconfident %}
Ohh, you’ll do it!? Thank you, Itsuki! It’s so wonderful to have such generous classmates! ♪
{% endbubble %}

### With Midori

<div class="msr-location">
    <p><span><b>Location:</b> Classroom 1-A</span></p>
</div>

{% bubble Chiaki grin %}
Takamine-kun, let’s go to the club!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori shocked %}
Huh…? Um, sorry, may I ask who you are…?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki fist %}
What!? Did you forget who I am, Takamine!? I’m the burning heart Morisawa Chiaki! I’m Ryuseitai’s leader, and the captain of the Basketball Club! ☆
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori sighfrown %}
Ah—So it really *was* Morisawa-senpai… Ughh~ It’s all ‘cause you called me by “Takamine-kun” out of nowhere… It’s kinda creepy…

Like, what happened to you…? Did you hit your head or something…?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki niyaclosed %}
Heh, you see, you always say how you hate suffocating things![^1]

So I thought you may feel otherwise if I tried to be *invigorating* instead![^2]
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki grin2 %}
And so! Takamine-kun! Let’s go to the club! Let's shed the sweat of youth…☆
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori takenaback %}
Ughh… You’re still coming right up into my personal space, so nothing’s actually changed, y’know…?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki shocked %}
Huh!? It didn’t work!? Mmm~, it’s hard for me to be the invigorating type!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki smile %}
Nevertheless! We’ve got Basketball Club activities today, so come join us, Takamine!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori sightired %}
Ugh~… You’ll drag me along with you even if I say it’s a pain, won’t you…?

Meh, fine… I don’t have any work at my family’s greengrocer today, and I have the time to spare…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki grin %}
Ohh!? Really!? I’m so happy to hear that, Takamine~♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki fist %}
Alright! This is a great time to invite Akehoshi and the others over, as well! Fuhahahaha! ☆
{% endbubble %}

### With Kanata

<div class="msr-location">
    <p><span><b>Location:</b> Fountain</span></p>
</div>

{% bubble Chiaki grin %}
Hmhmhmm…♪ <em><th>(Humming)</th></em>
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata v2 %}
fufufu…♪ fufufufufu…♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki surprised %}
Woah—!? You surprised me! Are you soaking in the fountain again, Kanata?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata smile %}
yes~ water is my [life force], after all.

would you like to join me, chiaki? the water is so cold and nice~♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki norsmile %}
I'm reading a book right now, so I'd rather refrain from doing so.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata curious %}
[book]…? what kind of [book] are you reading?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki grin2 %}
Ohh!? Are you interested too, Kanata!? It's a book that features every sentai hero in history! It's a precious treasure of mine~♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata norsmile %}
mm~ i am not interested.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki shocked %}
Why not!? Were we not comrades who share the same goal!? I believe in you, Kanata! I'm sure there's a part of you deep inside that admires heroes!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata frown %}
i do not really know what to say to that, you know… since i still do not understand heroes that well.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata norsmile %}
but, i want to learn more about them. chiaki, could you read that [book] for me, please?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki smileconfident %}
I don't mind, but I may as well lend it to you. It's my own copy, so you can return it to me anytime!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata awkward %}
um… [books] get [drenched wet] whenever i read them, so…

i do not want to [ruin] your precious [book]. please do read it for me instead, chiaki.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki fist %}
Ohh, right, since you're always soaked with water… Very well then, I'll read it out loud to you!

Alright, let's have a fun reading session together~! Fuhahahahaha…!! ☆
{% endbubble %}

### With Keito

<div class="msr-location">
    <p><span><b>Location:</b> Classroom 3-A</span></p>
</div>

{% bubble Chiaki fist %}
Bam! The hero has arrived…☆

Heh! Fear not, for I am here! I'll defeat all the evil in one swipe…☆
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Keito idle %}
…What on earth are you doing, Morisawa.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki surprised %}
Woah, Hasumi—!? Since when were you behind me…?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Keito frown %}
I was never once *behind* you, you were simply messing around in front of the classroom door.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Keito curious %}
Anyway, what were you doing?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki smilesoft %}
Mm, do you know about the toku broadcasted on Sunday mornings? I was re-enacting the scene when the ally of justice arrives!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Keito idle %}
Toku…? Ahh, you mean the hero series, huh. Yeah, I've watched one before.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki grin %}
Eh—Really!? Are you interested in hero series by any chance!?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Keito frown2 %}
Sorry to burst your bubble, but I just happened to come across an episode one day when I turned the TV on.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Keito serious %}
Although, I do think it's pretty excellent for a children's show.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Keito srsthinking %}
I forgot which series this was, but… I remember an episode where someone close to the protagonist fell ill to a chronic disease, and he had the opportunity to save them if he joined sides with the villains.

His close friend helped him time and time again, so he wanted to save them at any cost, but he knew they wouldn't forgive him for tainting his own hands for their sake.

In the end, after agonizing over what to do, he chose to remain an ally of justice… I found that story very moving.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki smileconfident %}
Ohh, I know that one! I've watched it plenty of times myself!

Wow, so you watched it too, Hasumi? I'm so happy~! We still have time before class starts, so let's talk about it a little more!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki grin %}
Ahhh, today's off to a wonderful start…☆
{% endbubble %}

### Translation Notes

[^1]: Chiaki is the hot-blooded type (known as <em>nekketsu-kei</em> 熱血系); people who are overly passionate and zealous about everything. These types of people tend to be called <em>atsukurushii</em> (translated as “suffocating” here) for being so enthusiastic that it can feel stuffy/suffocating.
[^2]: This management story is implied to happen at a very early time in the school year, and Chiaki is trying to use “-kun” honorific (instead of his usual way of referring to someone) to be “invigorating”. As the word implies, invigorating people tend to feel refreshing through their bright energy.
