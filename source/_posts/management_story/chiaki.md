### With Kaoru

{% note location %}
**Location:** Classroom 3-A
{% endnote %}

{% bubble Chiaki %}
Hmhmhm~ Hmhmhmmm~♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kaoru %}
You’re in a good mood, Morisawa-kun~ Did something nice happen to you?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki %}
Fuhahaha! I’m glad you asked, Hakaze!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kaoru %}
No, no, you *clearly* looked like you were waiting for someone to ask. Like, unbearably so.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki %}
Mhm! My bad! You see, my favorite tokusatsu show is going to have a movie!

I wanted to share this wonderful news with someone, so I ended up humming for attention!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kaoru %}
Mrmm… Couldn’t you just share that kinda stuff with someone who also likes tokusatsu? I don’t have any interest in it, y’know~?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki %}
True, I could’ve, but I really couldn’t hold back my urge to tell someone!

If anything nice happens to you, feel free to tell me all about it! Even if I don’t know anything about the topic, I’ll be happy about it with you…☆
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kaoru %}
Ahaha\~ Thanks. I think it’s nice that you’re that type of person, yeah\~
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki %}
Ooh! Thank *you*! Let’s hang out, Hakaze! We’ll watch the movie together once it comes out!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kaoru %}
Yeah, no thanks. No way I’ll ever go to a movie with a guy~♪
{% endbubble %}

### With Tetora

{% note location %}
**Location:** Park
{% endnote %}

{% bubble Chiaki %}
The red flames are the mark of justice! Burning bright red, the sun of life! Ryusei Red! Morisawa Chiaki…!

You say yours too, Nagumo! …Ah! Did you forget it by any chance? Alright then, I’ll say it right now, so make sure to remember it!

The black flames are the mark of effort! The burning fighting spirit, stained with the soil of the earth! Ryusei Black! Nagumo Tetora…!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora %}
Umm… Taichou? Sorry for asking while you’re so excited, but… Could you tell me why you called us here?

You told us to come over here after class, but I only see the two of us in this park…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki %}
Mhm, I’ve no idea where Kanata is, but Sengoku said he’d come, so he should be here soon.

The reason I called you all here is so we could perform a hero show. And also to practice our catchphrases!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora %}
Ahh, right, you want us to gather a crowd of kids again. But before I came here, Midori-kun told me somethin’ during class…

He said he won’t be able to come 'cuz he has to work at his family’s greengrocer.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki %}
Hold on, I wasn’t told about this…? This means that me, you, and Sengoku are the only ones who’ll perform.

Well, no matter. Hardships are an inevitability for heroes! By overcoming them, you become qualified to call yourself one!

Oh! Here comes Sengoku. And the children are here, too. Now that we have our guests, we should start our hero show!
{% endbubble %}

### With Shu

{% note location %}
**Location:** Handicrafts Clubroom
{% endnote %}

{% bubble Chiaki %}
Itsuki, are you in here…!?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shu %}
*Non!* Knock before you come in!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki %}
Sorry, sorry. The thing is, I've been looking for you because I have something to ask of you.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shu %}
Something to ask of me…? Hmph, this isn’t going to be something frivolous, is it?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki %}
No, see… One of the Ryuseitai uniforms has started to come apart. Could you fix it for me, please?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shu %}
I heard your uniforms were made by Kiryu. Shouldn’t you ask him, instead?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki %}
I’d love to, but… He wasn’t in the dojo, nor in his classroom… I think he’s gone home.

We have a hero show planned for tomorrow, so I need it fixed as soon as possible…

I’ll pay you, of course. I know I’m asking for a lot, but could you fix it by today? Please! I’m begging you!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shu %}
Raise your head. You’d probably remain here until I say yes, and that would cause me far more trouble. I will agree only this once.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki %}
Ohh, you’ll do it? Thank you, Itsuki! It’s so wonderful to have such kind classmates! ♪
{% endbubble %}

### With Midori

{% note location %}
**Location:** Classroom 1-A
{% endnote %}

{% bubble Chiaki %}
Takamine-kun, let’s go to the club!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
Huh…? Um, sorry, who are you again…?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki %}
What!? Did you forget who I am, Takamine!? I’m the burning heart Morisawa Chiaki! I’m Ryuseitai’s leader, and the captain of the Basketball Club! ☆
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
Ah—So it *was* you… Ughh~ Don’t call me by “Takamine-kun” out of nowhere… It’s super weird…

Like, what happened to you…? Did you hit your head or something…?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki %}
Heheh, you see, you kept saying how you hated me being overbearing!

So I thought you may feel otherwise if I tried to be more charming![^1]

And so! Takamine-kun! Let’s go to the club! Let's shed the sweat of youth…☆
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
Uurgh… You’re still coming right up into my personal space, so nothing’s actually changed, y’know…?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki %}
Huh!? So it didn’t work!? Mrrm, it’s hard to be charming!!

Nevertheless! We have practice today, so come join us, Takamine!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
Urghh… You’ll drag me along with you no matter how many times I say no, won’t you…?

Meh, fine… I don’t have any work at the greengrocer’s today, and I have the time to spare…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki %}
Ohh!? Really!? I’m so happy to hear that, Takamine~♪

Alright! This is a great time to invite Akehoshi and the others over, as well! Fuhahaha! ☆
{% endbubble %}

### With Kanata

{% note location %}
**Location:** Fountain
{% endnote %}

{% bubble Chiaki %}
Hmhmhmm…♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata %}
hehehe…♪ hehehehehe…♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki %}
Woah—!? You surprised me, Kanata! You're bathing in the fountain again?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata %}
yes~ water is my life force, after all.

would you like to join me, chiaki? the water is so cold and nice~♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki %}
I'm reading a book right now, so I'd rather refrain from doing so.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata %}
book…? what kind of book are you reading?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki %}
Ohh!? Are you interested, Kanata!? It's a book that features every sentai hero in history! It's a precious treasure of mine~♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata %}
mm~ not interested.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki %}
Why not!? Were we not brethren who share the same goal!? I believe in you, Kanata! I'm sure there's a part of you deep inside that admires heroes!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata %}
i don't really know what to say to that, you know… i still don't understand heroes that well.

but, i want to learn more about them. chiaki, could you read that book for me, please?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki %}
I don't mind, but I may as well lend it to you. It's my own copy, so you can return it to me anytime!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata %}
um… books get drenched wet whenever i read them, so…

i don't want to ruin your precious book. please do read it for me instead, chiaki.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki %}
Ohh, right, since you're always soaking with water… Very well then, I'll read it out loud to you!

Alright, let's have a fun reading session together~! Fuhahahahaha…!! ☆
{% endbubble %}

### With Keito

{% note location %}
**Location:** Classroom 3-A
{% endnote %}

{% bubble Chiaki %}
Bam! The hero has arrived…☆

Heh! Fear not, for I am here! I'll defeat all the evil in one swipe…☆
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Keito %}
…What on earth are you doing, Morisawa.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki %}
Woah, Hasumi—!? Since when were you behind me…?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Keito %}
I was never once *behind* you, you were simply messing around in front of the classroom door.

Anyway, what were you doing?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki %}
Mm, do you know about the toku broadcasted on Sunday mornings? I was re-enacting a hero scene from the show!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Keito %}
Toku…? Ahh, you mean the hero shows, huh. Yeah, I've watched one before.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki %}
Wha—Really!? Are you interested in hero shows by any chance!?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Keito %}
Sorry to burst your bubble, but I just happened to come across an episode one day when I turned the TV on.

But I do think it's pretty excellent for a children's show.

I forgot which series this was, but… I remember an episode where someone close to the protagonist fell ill to a chronic disease, and he had the opportunity to save them if he joined sides with the villains.

His close friend helped him time and time again, so he wanted to save them at any cost, but he knew they wouldn't forgive him for tainting his own hands for their sake.

In the end, after agonizing over what to do, he chose to be a hero… I found that very inspiring.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki %}
Ohh, I know that one! I've watched it plenty of times myself!

Wow, so even you've watched it, Hasumi!? I'm so happy~! We still have time before class starts, so let's talk about it a little more!

Ahhh, today's off to a wonderful start…☆

### Translation Notes

[^1]: This management story is implied to happen at a very early time in the school year, and Chiaki is trying to use “-kun” honorific (instead of his usual way of referring to someone) to be more charming.
