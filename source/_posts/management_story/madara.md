### With Mitsuru

<div class="msr-location">
    <p><span><b>Location:</b> Near the Staff Office</span></p>
</div>

{% bubble Madara %}
Ohhh? Mitsuru-saaaan! What’s up, hm? Do you need to go to the staff office?

Aaalrighty then! Mama’s coming with you! It’ll be like a parent-teacher conference, and this way, you won’t have to feel nervous going in alone! ☆
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mitsuru %}
Uurgh~ It’s got nothing to do with you, Buchou-dude… Also, I’m not feeling nervous.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Madara %}
That sooo! Sorry, sorry, I guess you’re just here by chance.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mitsuru %}
Um, not really. I do have to go in there, 'cuz like, I got scolded by Akiomi-sensei just now.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Madara %}
Ahhh, so you’re feeling down, not nervous. Mhm, mhm, it sucks to be scolded by a teacher, doesn’t it!

Do you like onigiri, Mitsuru-san? I got okaka onigiri and umeboshi onigiri with me! I’ll give you whicheeever you prefer! If you like both, then I’ll give you both…♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mitsuru %}
Huh? Onigiri? I don’t like umeboshi, it’s too salty~ I guess I’d prefer the okaka one?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Madara %}
Okaka it is, then! I’ll eat the umeboshi! Time for a snaaack~☆
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mitsuru %}
Wait, wait! The teachers’ll scold you for eating here! I don’t get you anyway! Why’re you suddenly asking me if I like onigiri?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Madara %}
Ahh, that's 'cause I looove onigiri! And eating your favorite food will cheer you riiight up! Though, onigiri isn’t *your* favorite, is it…

I’ll go buy you your favorite food! Eat it and cheer up! Smile! Fortune comes to those who smiiile! Hahahaha!! ☆
{% endbubble %}

### With Chiaki

<div class="msr-location">
    <p><span><b>Location:</b> Classroom 3-A</span></p>
</div>

{% bubble Madara %}
Oh, if it isn't Chiaki-san! Good mooooorniiiiiing…☆
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki %}
Ahh, Mikejima-san… Good morning, I see you're energetic as always.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Madara %}
Mmm~? You don't seem as energetic, though. What's wrong, something happen? I'll help you out if you need it!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki %}
Nothing happened, it's just… I'm feeling kind of depressed about our upcoming math class.

I know nothing will come out of being down, but I can't get myself back into the swing of things…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Madara %}
Ohh, reaaally? I thought you'd be good at math since you're such a hard worker. Guess I was wrong, huh?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki %}
Ahaha, I'm actually really bad at it, so I always make sure to study as much as possible.

We have a math quiz today, so I stayed up late last night studying.

But instead of giving me a confidence boost, all it did was make me feel light-headed from the lack of sleep…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Madara %}
Mmm…? It's just a quiz, riiight? You don't need to overthink it.

Hm, buuut if it'll help you out, we could study a bit together? There might be something I could teach you to prep you up!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki %}
R-Really? You'd be okay with that!? Thank you so much, Mikejima-san!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Madara %}
Hahaha, 'course! I'll aaalways help out a person in need!

Aaalrighty then, let's get to it! We've got this, Chiaki-san…♪
