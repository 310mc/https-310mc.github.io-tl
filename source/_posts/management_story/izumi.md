### With Chiaki

{% note location %}
**Location:** Classroom 3-A
{% endnote %}

{% bubble Chiaki %}
Oh! Sena! Good mooorning!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Izumi %}
You're sooo loud early in the morning, Morisawa.  …Is nobody here yet?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki %}
Not yet! I had class duty today, so I came much earlier!

Do you always come to school this early? That's incredible, I respect you…☆
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Izumi %}
It's not *that* incredible… Besides, I'm actually *way* later than usual 'cause they had that newbie on duty in the idol course reception, and they took *forever* to let me in.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki %}
Oh yeah, there's been a new receptionist on duty this year, huh?

But that's strange, I was allowed inside pretty easily.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Izumi %}
Yeah, well, I was with the new kid. I can't *believe* that receptionist made the same mistake again after the thorough lecture I gave them before!

This is their <em>job</em>, they shouldn't be forgetting what to do every second.

I scolded them again to do a better job next time, but I might just report to their boss if they forget what to do <em>again</em>.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki %}
Hmm, you were late because of the newcomer, but you don't seem all that angry to me.

In fact, you look pretty happy!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Izumi %}
I love picking on newbies and juniors, after all~

I had a lot of fun telling them off, so I can't deny that I'm happy~♪
