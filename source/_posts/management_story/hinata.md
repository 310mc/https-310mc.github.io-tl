### With Chiaki

<div class="msr-location">
    <p><span><b>Location:</b> Gym</span></p>
</div>

{% bubble Hinata %}
Please excuse meee~…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki %}
Hm? Ohhh, would you like to use the gym? Sorry! The Basketball Club reserved the spot for this hour!

However, you're free to use the unreserved space over on that side!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Hinata %}
Ahh, no, I'm just here to pick up something I forgot.

Um, there's only you here, though. Where are the rest of the club members?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki %}
Oh, I actually came here a little earlier than the appointed time.

Nobody's here yet. But I figured I could use my spare time playing basketball by myself!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Hinata %}
Huh, I see… Oh! Did this fall out of the ball basket? Oh well, here goes nothing—Aaand shoot…! ☆
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki %}
Ohhh~! Wow, you shot the goal perfectly! Do you have experience in basketball by any chance!?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Hinata %}
Ahaha, I just got lucky! I felt like I could make the shot from my spot, is all.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki %}
That's still amazing, y'know!? You might have what it takes to become a basketball player!

Ermm… Would you mind practicing with me until the rest of my club members arrive? Only if you're alright with it, of course!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Hinata %}
Ah, sure! I don't really have anything to do right now, so I may as well~♪

Heh… I dunno if I'll ever get another chance to play with the basketball captain himself, so I'm gonna go all out. Please make sure to prepare yourself~♪
{% endbubble %}

### With Midori

<div class="msr-location">
    <p><span><b>Location:</b> Entrance</span></p>
</div>

{% bubble Midori %}
<th>(I don't have any unit or club activities for the day, so I can go home straight away…)</th>

<th>(And my parents told me I don't have to help out today, so I finally have a day for myself…♪)</th>
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Hinata %}
Heeey, Midori-kun!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
Eep—! Huh, Aoi-kun? W-What's wrong…? Why're you out of breath…?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Hinata %}
Oh, nah, nothing bad happened. Anyway, you free right now, Midori-kun?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
No, I'm not… I have something to do…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Hinata %}
Oh, okay… I wanted you to come with me somewhere if you had the time to spare, but oh well…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
<th>(Uu… He looks so down…)</th>

<th>(Maybe I shouldn't have lied to him… Uuu~ I won't be able to sleep through the guilt if I go home now…)</th>

Um, Aoi-kun… I know I said I had something to do just a second ago, but I can leave it for later, so… I could at least hear you out…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Hinata %}
Woah, really!? Thanks~ I'm so glad to have such a kind classmate! ♪

Right, so—Yuuta-kun and I were planning to go to a live show together, but he won't be able to make it anymore 'cause something came up outta nowhere.

I couldn't get anyone else to join me either, 'cause they've all got things to do…

I could just go on my own, but I'd be wasting a ticket, so I wanted to try finding someone to go with.

So, Midori-kun! Come with me to the live show! Please
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
Whaa…? I *just* said I'd *only* hear you out…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Hinata %}
So it's a no-go…? There isn't much time left 'til it starts, though! You're the only one I can count on at this point~!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
Uuu… I *guess* it'd be a shame to let that ticket go to waste… But I'm only making an exception this once, okay…?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Hinata %}
Thanks a bunch\~! Mhm, mhm, I'm so glad I have such a kind guy for a classmate\~♪
