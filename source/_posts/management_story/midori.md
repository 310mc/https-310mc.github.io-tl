### With Chiaki

<div class="msr-location">
    <p><span><b>Location:</b> Entrance</span></p>
</div>

{% bubble Midori %}
*Sigh*… I thought I’d have today off since there are no unit activities, but now I found out that there’s club practice instead…

I could tolerate it if this was planned beforehand, but being told about it only now makes it so much worse…

I don’t even feel like doing anything… What do I do… Should I just take the day off…?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki %}
Hold it, Takamine! You shouldn’t skip! I overheard what you said just now, and as your club captain I’m obliged to advise you to do otherwise!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
Urghh… The most bothersome guy just *had* to hear me talking to myself… This is so depressing, I wanna die…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki %}
If you have no motivation, then you just need to find some! I’ll do whatever it takes to pump motivation back into you!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
Don’t just blabber anything out of your mouth… If I could just “find some,” then I wouldn’t be suffering this much…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki %}
There’s plenty of ways to feel motivated, y’know? Like, getting yourself hyped up with adrenaline…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
Adrenaline…? How would I go about doing that…?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki %}
One way would be to put yourself in a life-threatening situation, but we can’t conduct anything dangerous, so…

An easier, faster way would be to work out! And so, without further ado, let’s head to the gym and play basketball!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
…? I can’t keep up with you… Aren’t you just saying something extremely dumb…?

Ahh, I can’t take it anymore… Everything is such a damn pain… Can someone *please* talk some sense into this guy…
{% endbubble %}

### With Kanata

<div class="msr-cw">
    <span><b>Content Warning</b></span>
    <p>Casual suicide and drowning mention.</p>
</div>

<div class="msr-location">
    <p><span><b>Location:</b> Fountain</span></p>
</div>

{% bubble Midori %}
I’m so depressed… I wanna die… I’m depressed enough to try and drown myself in this fountain…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata %}
*puka, puka*…♪ oh, midori…? hello~ have you also come to [bathe]?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
Woah— Something came out the water…! Um, Shinkai-senpai? What’re you doing in there?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata %}
fufufu, i am [bathing], of course~ it feels so [nice] to be soaked in water…♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
Uhh, okay… It’s too weird for me to actually understand, though.

Um, I shouldn’t be interrupting you, so… I’m gonna leave…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata %}
wait a moment, midori. you are my [one] hundredth [guest], so.

as [celebration], i would like to give you this [macropinna] plush [toy]~♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
Gwah!? Please don’t shove something in my face out of nowhere… I was this close to actually suffocating to death…

And what do you mean by one hundredth…? Were there that many depressed people like me…?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata %}
i am sorry. i have only been counting the people who have come to the fountain while i am [bathing]… i do not know if they were [depressed].

never mind that. here you go~ please give them lots of love…♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
Eh, I guess I’ll take it… Hm? Wait, this looks similar to my favorite mascot character…

Thank you, Shinkai-senpai! I’m feeling so much better now!
{% endbubble %}

### With Hajime

<div class="msr-location">
    <p><span><b>Location:</b> Shopping District</span></p>
</div>

{% bubble Midori %}
*Sigh*… Welcome…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Hajime %}
Hehe, Takamine-kun, hello~♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
Ah, Shino-kun… You came to shop here again…♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Hajime %}
Yes~! Your home’s vegetables are very delicious. But I feel a bit bad that you sell them so cheap for me.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
Don't worry, the ones out of shape have lost value, that’s all.

We can’t really sell them anymore, so you’re actually helping us out a lot…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Hajime %}
Oh no no, it’s fine. They’re still just as delicious. Hehe, my family really enjoyed the tomatoes you gave me the other day, too\~♪ They said they were sweet and tasty\~
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
Ah, we have some nice stuff for sale today, too… Also, as thanks for being our regular customer, I’ll give you some cucumbers as extra, okay…?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Hajime %}
Waaah, are you sure that’s okay? Thank you very much! This is such a lifesaver~♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
Hehe… Please come again to Takamine’s Greengrocer…♪
{% endbubble %}

### With Tetora

<div class="msr-location">
    <p><span><b>Location:</b> Gym</span></p>
</div>

{% bubble Midori %}
*Sigh*… Playing basketball is so depressing, I wanna die…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora %}
Midori-kun, do it properly! C’mon, you’ve got the ball now, so take the shot!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
Ehhh… I’m too far from the goal to do that…

But it’s also a pain to try and dribble past everyone until I’m closer… I’m just gonna pass it to you, so you do the rest…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora %}
Like I *just* said! Do it properly! All we’ve been doing so far is passing the ball back and forth to each other; it’s not real practice!

Mrrm… I’ve been kinda wondering for a while, but… Do you dislike basketball?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
I don’t dislike it, but I don’t love it, either…

Why do I have to play basketball in my club *and* during class, too… *Sigh*… I wanna die…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora %}
Jeez, you gotta stop saying that all the time!

But, to be fair, if you aren’t interested in something, you’re not gonna like it no matter how much you do it, so… Let’s do some passing drills over there, instead.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
Huh? You sure…? I’d honestly rather just huddle myself deep into a corner, though…?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora %}
Yeah, uh, I don’t think that’s a good idea. Try to hold on 'til class is over and practice with me a li'l, please.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
Ahaha…… You look like the one who’s trying to hold on, though… You probably wanted to practice together with everyone, huh…

Thank you. I get to take it easy now, so… you’re really helping me out…♪
{% endbubble %}

### With Shinobu

<div class="msr-location">
    <p><span><b>Location:</b> Library</span></p>
</div>

{% bubble Midori %}
<th>(Phew… It's so relaxing in the library…)</th>

<th>(It's so quiet in here, it makes me feel at peace… I just love how I can sit here and do nothing but stare into space…♪)</th>
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shinobu %}
Oh, Midori-kun? Are you here to borrow a book, too?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
Woah, Sengoku-kun…? Sorry, I was so out of it that I didn't notice you came in here.

Yeah, I felt like borrowing a book to kill time… 'Cause I way prefer reading at home than moving my body…♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shinobu %}
Me too\~! I'm an indoor ninja, after all\~♪

What genres do you usually read, Midori-kun?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
I don't have any specific one I like… I tend to read books I feel like I could relate to, I guess…?

What about you, Sengoku-kun…?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shinobu %}
I'm fascinated by animal biology, so I plan to borrow a book all about frogs~♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
Ahh, you did mention that you own pet frogs…

Mmm… Frog-themed mascots are cute, but I don't think I'd vibe with the real thing…

I could see the small ones being cute, but there's no way I can handle the big ones… I'd be too terrified to touch them…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shinobu %}
Hehe, it simply takes time getting used to\~! You'll find that the bigger ones are just as cute\~♪

Look at this photo, Midori-kun! These two here are Momocchi and Thunder~♪ Aren't they adorable?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
Huh? Um, I guess…?

I'll show you pictures of my favorite mascots, too. I know for a fact that you'll feel soothed by how adorable they are…♪
{% endbubble %}

### With Yuta

<div class="msr-location">
    <p><span><b>Location:</b> Hallway</span></p>
</div>

{% bubble Midori %}
Hmhmhmmm~…♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Yuta %}
Oh? Midori-kun! You sound like you're in a good mood~ Did something nice happen to you?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
Mm…? Aoi-kun…? Mhm, the transfer student made me a mascot…♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Yuta %}
Mascot…? Ahh, the one on your bag?

Huh… So you like this kind of stuff?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
Mhm… Looking at mascots soothes my soul… But most of all, they give me a reason to live…♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Yuta %}
I don't really get what you mean by the latter, but I can see how they can be soothing. I feel at ease just looking at it.

Hm… Would the transfer student make me one too if I asked?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
Yeah, I'm sure she'd gladly make you one…

She's told me that it's the perfect way to practice her sewing, and that I could request new ones anytime…

Ah—If you ever ask her to make you one, could you show it to me, too…?

All her hand-made mascots are super cute, so I'd love to look at them for comfort…♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Yuta %}
Ahaha, sure. It's pretty rare to see you so eager to talk, Midori-kun!

That just shows how much you love mascots~ Mhm, mhm! It sure is wonderful to have things you love~♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
True… I always get back my will to live whenever I see mascots, no matter how depressed I get…

So maybe it really is nice to have something you love…♪
{% endbubble %}
