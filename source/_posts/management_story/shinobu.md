### With Mao

<div class="msr-location">
    <p><span><b>Location:</b> Hallway</span></p>
</div>

{% bubble Shinobu %}
Isara-dono~☆ Look, look! I bought this shuriken online!

I lost all hope and cried when I saw that it was out of stock… but when I checked the site again a few days ago, I saw that they had restocked it!

I just knew I had to buy it immediately, and spent all my pocket money to obtain it!

Now I'll have to survive with only scraps of Hyorogan food to get through the month, but I have no regrets! As soon as I see this shuriken, I’m the happiest I’ve ever been~♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mao %}
Ahh, yeah. I get that you’re super happy, but… could you move away from my stomach a bit?

The pressure’s getting kinda painful. You suddenly jumped on me, so I couldn’t prepare myself to catch you.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shinobu %}
Wawa—! Are you hurt anywhere? I was so enthralled about the shuriken and about seeing you that I lost myself for a moment!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mao %}
That part about you isn’t very ninja-like, huh~? Anyways, don’t you always have shurikens with you?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shinobu %}
Do you mean the rubber shurikens? Yes, I have plenty!

But this one I bought is a replica of a shuriken Hattori Hanzo once used.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mao %}
Whaa…? That sounds really fishy… You alright? You sure you aren’t being conned?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shinobu %}
Ahaha, I’ll be fine~ If the item was said to be authentic, even I would know it’s a scam.

But it matters not if it’s fake or replica — I can love anything that is ninja-related~♪
{% endbubble %}

### With Midori

<div class="msr-location">
    <p><span><b>Location:</b> Near the Auditorium</span></p>
</div>

{% bubble Shinobu %}
Midori-kuuun! I found what you were looking for! Ahh, but please do confirm if it's the correct one.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
Mhm… this is it alright… Thanks for helping me find it, Sengoku-kun…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shinobu %}
Oh no no, I'm the one who's thankful that you gave me this mission.

We don't have unit activities today, and I had a lot of spare time, to be honest…

I excel at finding items, so please do ask for my help again if you ever need it~♪

However… What sort of basketball practice would cause you to launch the ball all the way over here?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
That’s what *I* wanna know… I was told we’d have practice in the basketball court today, so I begrudgingly headed over there…

Only to hear that Morisawa-senpai apparently shot the ball outside the court… Jeez, we’re not playing soccer here…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shinobu %}
Ahaha… Nevertheless, I'm glad we found it.

…Hm? Isara-dono just messaged me. Heheh! Looks like I have a new mission to do!

I shall take my leave here! See you tomorrow, Midori-kun!
