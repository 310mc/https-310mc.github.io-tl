### With Midori

{% note location %}
**Location:** Near the Gym
{% endnote %}

{% bubble Tetora %}
Midori-kun, sorry to ask this outta nowhere, but… I'm Ryusei Black, right?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
Huh…? W-What even…? Wow, that really *is* out of nowhere…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora %}
Well, I was thinking… I'm Ryusei Black, so my outfits are black, too, right?

So I was like, why not I make my belt black, too?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
"Belt"…? Do you mean your karate belt? I dunno how that works, but aren't only incredible people allowed to wear one…?

And that someone has to have cleared an insane trial… Like, taking a beating from strong waterfalls deep in the mountains, or defeating the Four Heavenly Kings… right…?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora %}
Where the heck did you get that idea from? You just pass the promotion exam to become a black-belt.

Thing is, though, it's not easy beating it. I've gotta train harder and harder…

Wait, how could I forget—that's *exactly* what fires you up about it! Sorry 'bout what I said earlier! I shouldn't have made it sound so easy!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
Huh? Why're you apologizing to me…? Actually, why'd you even talk to *me* about it…?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora %}
OOOHHH!! This Nagumo Tetora's gonna do his absolute best\~! ☆ It may take some time, but I'll be a black-belt before I get as old as Taishou, you'll see\~!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
W-Why's he suddenly getting fired up… Um, Nagumo-kun? I'm gonna head over to my club, 'kay…?
