### With Chiaki

<div class="msr-location">
    <p><span><b>Location:</b> Gym</span></p>
</div>

{% bubble Subaru %}
Yoohoo, it's mee~! Hmm? I'm the only one here, huh? Oh well, guess I'll practice some dribbling on my own!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki %}
Worry not, Akehoshi, for I am here! Let's practice together! Let's shed the sweat of youth…☆
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Subaru %}
That's kinda gross, so I'd like to switch partners, thaaanks~ And don't get near me, 'kay? Ugh, why's Chi~chan-senpai the only one around…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki %}
Well, that's because we have club activities today! The rest of our members should come soon, so let's shed the sweat of youth together until then…☆
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Subaru %}
I *just* said not to get near me! I was *trying* to ignore your existence by emphasizing that it's *only* me here, y'know!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki %}
Oh! I thought you *didn't* notice me, that's why I called out to you as loud as possible. Well, no matter! I'll be defense, so hit me with your best shot!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Subaru %}
Did you *not* hear what I just said? I don't wanna play basketball with you!

Especially since you get even more annoying when you're defense… I'm gonna be defense instead, so you go on the offense, 'kay?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki %}
Why, of course! Right then, Akehoshi, here I come! Make sure to accept me whole…☆
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Subaru %}
Gah, he's just as annoying on the offense… I don't wanna try taking you on, so I'll just dodge.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki %}
Why not, Akehoshi!? I'm always ready to take all of you! You know what, let me go back to being defense!

Alrighty then, you're free to leap into my arms…☆
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Subaru %}
Uurghh… It's seriously sooo annoying to deal with him when he's energetic… You guys need to get over here already\~! I can't take this anymore\~!
{% endbubble %}

### With Mao

<div class="msr-location">
    <p><span><b>Location:</b> Fountain</span></p>
</div>

{% bubble Subaru %}
Zzz… zzz…♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mao %}
Oh, Subaru? You're gonna catch a cold if you sleep here, y'know~
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Subaru %}
Mmm…? Mmmmm…?

Huh? It's Sally\~! Goooood morning\~! ☆
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mao %}
Woah, don't jump on me. You're pretty energetic for someone who just woke up…

Wait, something fell off of you. What's this… a basketball magazine?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Subaru %}
Mhm. Chi~chan-senpai shoved it on me, saying something like, "Akehoshi! I can guarantee you that this'll inspire you to play if you read it!"

I don't really care for it much, but I know he'll come back asking me for my thoughts, sooo…

I was reading it while lying down, but I ended up sleeping halfway through instead!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mao %}
Ahaha, so it just ended up being a good way to fall asleep for you, huh?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Subaru %}
Yeah, I mean, I like basketball, but I'd rather move my body than study up on stuff. I looove playing with balls…♪

Hey, Sally~! You free right now? Let's play basketball together! I wanna play around with a ball!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mao %}
Hey now, you're gonna wrinkle my clothes if you tug on me.

Hmm~… I wasn't really gonna do anything except go home since I don't have any Student Council work, so sure, I'll join ya.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Subaru %}
Yaaay, I looove you~! Okay then, let's head to the gym! I wanna score some goals…☆
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mao %}
Sure, sure. Haha, you were reading the magazine properly all along, weren'tcha?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Subaru %}
C'mon, Sally\~, let's goooo! Get your legs moving! The ball is waiting for us\~! ☆
{% endbubble %}

### With Midori

<div class="msr-location">
    <p><span><b>Location:</b> Staff Office</span></p>
</div>

{% bubble Subaru %}
Excuse meee\~! Sagami-chan, you here\~?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
…………
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Subaru %}
Ohh, Takamin? What's up\~? I didn't expect to see you here\~☆
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
Akehoshi-senpai, please don't hug me… Urghh, you're as clingy as Morisawa-senpai…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Subaru %}
Whaaat\~? Don't lump me with him\~! It doesn't make me happy!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
U-Uh…? Anyway, Sagami-sensei isn't here… Wouldn't he be at the infirmary…?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Subaru %}
Mmm~ It's a pain to go all the way to the infirmary, so I guess I'll just leave the paper I'm supposed to turn in on his table.

What about you, Takamin? You here for the same reason?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
No, I'm just here to turn in my homework…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Subaru %}
Oooh, what kinda homework was it? What do you first years even learn in your classes? I'm super curious! Lemme see~☆
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
Uuu, please stop getting up in my face… I don't mind showing you, but there's nothing interesting about it, y'know…?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Subaru %}
Huh, so it's for history class? Woah, did you draw this one here?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
Ah, do you mean the historic figure I had to draw…? Please stop staring, it's embarrassing…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Subaru %}
Why're you embarrassed? It looks amazing! I didn't know you were good at drawing!

Draw me next time you can, Takamin! I'll treasure it~! Promise me, okay? ♪
