{% bubble Mao %}
Oh, Takamine? Nice seeing you here! Are you here to do shopping, too?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
No… I live here… Actually, you're right in front of my house…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mao %}
Oh, you're right, it says "Takamine's Greengrocer". Wow, so this is your home, huh… Hmm… I may as well buy something from you, then!

What do you recommend I get, Takamine? Oh, and if you give me a recipe or two that uses veggies, I should be able to make 'em at home by myself.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
Um, I can't answer that on the spot… But the veggies you see at the front are the seasonal ones…

Wait a sec, Isara-senpai, you make your own food…? Do you live by yourself…?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mao %}
Nah, I live with my family, but I grew up living my life independently, 'cause my parents think I should be able to cook and do stuff on my own.

I keep making myself instant noodles, though. But since that's not a healthy diet, I figured it's about time I start eating more veggies.

I'll only make enough for myself, so I don't need *that* many ingredients… But hey, if I ever make too much food, I could carry a lunch box to school for once.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
Wow, you're already so busy with work, but you even *cook* for yourself…? That's amazing…

Umm, Isara-senpai, I think we overstocked the vegetables in the back, so we could sell them to you for cheap…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mao %}
Woah, for real!? I'd love that\~! Thanks a bunch, Takamine. Guess I'm having a veggie-filled dinner tonight\~♪
