{% bubble Kuro %}
(…Right, I bought everything I need; time to head back to school.)
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki %}
Oh! Is that you, Kiryu!? What’s up, what were you doing? Were you shopping?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kuro %}
Ooh, Morisawa. I was just done buyin’ a knitting needle and some wool from the handicrafts store.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki %}
Are you going to knit something? My mother sometimes knits on her days off, too—she tried making me wear the sweater she made once.

But there was a huge heart knitted right in the middle, and it was honestly too embarrassing for me to wear… So I gave it to my dad instead.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kuro %}
That so? Haha, ain’t that nice—You get on well with your family~♪

I was also thinkin’ of knittin’ a plushie for my fami—my li’l sis, actually, so I bought some materials for that, too.

Sounds like it’s become a fad to have a knitted plushie at her school, so I figured it’d be too cruel for her to be the only one without one.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki %}
Mhm, mhm! Your little sister is so fortunate to have such a wonderful big brother!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kuro %}
Haha, ya really think a brother like me is fortunate to have~?

But well, I do plan to do whatever I can for her to feel that way about me.
