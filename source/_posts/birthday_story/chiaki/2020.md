{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Hiiro %}
Hm? Yes, that's right! You are my comrade, and I'm quite indebted to you. It's only natural that I would celebrate your birthday!

I also prepared a present, so please open it at a later time, if that's alright with you. I bought it from the shopping center, so it should hopefully not be anything strange…

## Translation Notes

[^1]: Shinobu says this phrase a lot, so there's an implication that Chiaki's copying after him.
