I'm sorry I'm late, I was planning to come back as soon as I was done with work, but…

I went to help someone before coming here; that's why I almost didn't make it.

              Ah, no, the old lady I helped gave me cookies.

              But she gave me quite a lot, so I'm not sure if I can eat them all on my own…

              Oh, I know! I'll eat them with everyone in the party! You have some too, Anzu…☆

              I was looking for a lost kid's mother!

              The kid was crying at first, but once I asked about their favorite hero, they happily told me all about it!

              I helped someone climb the stairs, and someone else with walking across the street, and even fetching a balloon stuck somewhere up high.

              Huh? I was doing a lot of great work? It's not a big deal, really…

              But if that's how you feel, then maybe so! Fuhahaha! ☆

## Translation Notes

[^1]: Shinobu says this phrase a lot, so there's an implication that Chiaki's copying after him.
