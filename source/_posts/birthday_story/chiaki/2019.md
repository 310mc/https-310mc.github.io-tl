              However! I wanted to show off that it’s my birthday so that we can share the joy of this day~♪

              Of course, I went to class looking like this, too! Everyone had pretty fun reactions to it~☆

              Your expressions are looking a lot softer lately, Anzu. I'm glad I get to see lots of different kinds of faces from you.

              It probably isn’t heroic of me to be happy over surprising someone, but it's my birthday! Forgive me this once!

              I feel like the temperature here slipped all the way down to the bottom… The only thing that could melt this frozen heart right now is a "Happy birthday" from you, Anz—

              Hm?! What's wrong, Anzu? Your expression is hard to understand… It feels like things just got a lot colder now, you know?!

              Today's my birthday, you see! So I've been going around and telling everyone all about it!

              I made my sash by myself. Earlier, when I was telling Takamine about my birthday, it fell off of me from moving around too roughly…

              He was really shocked, saying "What are you doing?!"

              Then he clipped the sash back on for me with a mascot character pin! Isn't that so touching?

you are always so lively and energetic whenever you are [being] a hero, you see~…♪

fufu, please keep being just like that, [chiaki]. *puka, puka*…♪
{% endbubble %}

### Tetora

{% bubble Tetora %}
Taichou, is it true that you made that sash before it was time for your birthday party?

Oh jeez… I wish you'd think a li'l more 'bout this, like, you gotta be a li'l more mature when it comes to stuff like this, y'know? It'll give us problems otherwise.

*Honestly*… I mean, we've celebrated everyone's birthday by now — Did you *really* think we wouldn't celebrate yours?

If that's what you really thought, then you definitely need to work on this.

There's no way we wouldn't celebrate your birthday! You're our *leader*, so please keep that firmly in your mind!

…Here I am lecturin' you on your birthday of all days… Heheh… I'm sorry.

Please let me say the most important thing, at least! Happy birthday, Taichou…♪
{% endbubble %}

### Midori

{% bubble Midori %}
Erm, Morisawa-senpai… Happy birthday…

Heheh, isn't it so cute…? Mhm, I'm talking about the mascot pin I clipped on you…♪

Umm… Why do you look so happy? I wasn't complimenting you, y'know…?

Ughh… I should've never said "cute"… Actually, I shouldn't have given you that pin in the first place…

Could you give it back? Immediately, please… Um, no, don't refuse my request so desperately…

Huh…!? It's my present to you…? That wasn't at all why I gave it to you, though…?

Ahh, dammit, this is so annoying… Fine, whatever. Feel free to make it your birthday present… So please just leave me alone already…
{% endbubble %}

### Shinobu

{% bubble Shinobu v2 %}
Taichou-dono~! Happy birthday!

With this, we have gone through every Ryuseitai member's birthday. It's just perfect that we end these celebrations with your birthday, Taichou-dono~♪

Erm, when it was my birthday party, we had fun being ninjas for the day, yes?

That made me extremely happy, and so… I would love to do something similar for your birthday, Taichou-dono.

And so! We will now play a hero game with everyone in here~! ♪

Hmhm. We have enough people to be the victims, the villains, and the heroes.

Yaaay! Taichou-dono looks completely up for it~! Okay then, let's commence at once!
{% endbubble %}

### Subaru

{% bubble Subaru %}
Chi\~chan-senpai, happy birthday! I came here with Sally\~ to celebrate\~☆

…Woah! I said I'm here to *celebrate*, not "get hugged by you"!

Jeez. I can never let my guard down around you! It's still so hot, so why do you wanna hug me so much?

Is it 'cause you're born in summer that you don't feel the heat as much? Actually, you're *exactly* the definition of "born in summer," don't you think?

No, no! That wasn't me complimenting you, y'know!? Quit hugging me already~!

Oh come *on*, Chi~chan-senpai! I'm here to celebrate your birthday, so sit down nice and quiet, and let me do it!
{% endbubble %}

### Mao

{% bubble Mao %}
Buchou, happy birthday~♪

I think Anzu already invited you for it, but — Do you still have time after this?

Would you like to go to a fast food restaurant with everyone? Subaru mentioned he wants to go home only after eating somewhere outside, so~♪

It's my present for you, so I'll be the one paying!

Uh-uh, I just *knew* you'd say you wanna pay. But I'm not backing down from my offer!

Well, guess we've decided on the afterparty then\~♪ We can't have an exciting party without the lead role, 'kay\~?
{% endbubble %}

### Kuro

{% bubble Kuro %}
You look real excited, Morisawa. Are you that happy to play hero with so many people?

I never thought I'd play pretend at a birthday party of someone my age… It'd make sense if it were my sister's, but this is somethin' alright…

Actually, you sure it's okay for me to play the hero? I mean, I feel like it's more suitable for me to be the big bad boss, or somethin'…

Ah, so I'd be *too* suited for that role and end up scarin' the first years. Well, it's your birthday. I'll do it the way you like.

We're all plannin' to be here with you the whole day, anyway.

…Oh, I almost forgot to say somethin' important. Happy birthday, Morisawa~♪
{% endbubble %}

### Madara

{% bubble Madara %}
Chiaki-saaaaaaaan! Are you enjoying this wonderful special daaaaaaaay~? ☆

Though you showed up like that straaaight from the morning, so I'm sure you are. I mean, even *I* was dumbfounded!

Izumi-san said he lost all will to celebrate, buuut he's just in a bad mood 'cause you ruined his plans, that's all.

Truth is, he was planning to throw a cake at you as soooon as you came to class, but you showed up in that outfit, so it would've ruined it, yeah?

Well, doesn't mean he's given up entiiirely, though. I think you're just about to get the splat…? Haha, nope, I didn't say anything! Hahahahaha! ☆
