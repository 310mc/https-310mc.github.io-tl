What're you guys doing? You're talking way too loudly, y'know…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kaoru v2 %}
Oh, Senacchi, you're back in Japan, huh? Oh yeah, since you're here… About the makeup we talked about the other day…

            Ah, you'd like some time to talk to me alone after the party? You're always free to ask me something like that, y'know?

            Fufu, Anzu, you're talking so quietly, that I ended up following suit and talking quietly, too. It's like we're having a private conversation between the two of us.

{% bubble Eichi %}
Oh? I was wondering why it was so lively here… Why're you all gathered in the cafeteria? Isn't Chiaki's birthday party happening a little later?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki %}
Tenshouin! Now you're here, too!? It's like our class from last year's here!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kaoru v2 %}
Oh yeah, everyone here was in class 3-A, huh? What a coincidence for us all to be here.

            {% bubble Chiaki grin2 %}
            Even if it's all a coincidence that we're here, I'm still really happy! If Sena feels the same way, I'd be even happier!

            Ermm, we only need Hasumi, Itsuki, and Mikejima-san for it to be the old class 3-A.
            {% endbubble %}
            {% bubble Eichi %}
            I spotted Mikejima-kun and Itsuki-kun at the elevator, and Keito said he'll be at the party as well. All our classmates will be in the same place, won't they?

### Birthday Night, Part One

#### <div mt="rare"></div> 1/3

{% img /img/es/birthdaystory/es2/chiaki/birthdaynight1_1.jpg %}

{% bubble Chiaki %}
Anzu, I'm so sorry I'm late! My phone call took a long time…

It's happening much later into the future, but I received a special offer to participate in a certain hero show. I was talking to them just now about it.

They told me, "we'd love to see Morisawa-san in our hero show," so I *have* to do my absolute best for them…♪
{% endbubble %}

<div class="msr-narration">
    <p>This is your time to shine.</p>
</div>

{% bubble Chiaki %}
Mhm! I'm extremely grateful to know there are people out there expecting a lot from me!

I'm really looking forward to meetings all the kids~♪
{% endbubble %}

#### <div mt="rare"></div> 2/3

{% bubble Chiaki %}
Oh! I shouldn't just talk about myself. I'd love to know what you wanted to tell me.

Hm, hm! You wanted to give me a present? Thank you, I'm so happy!

I got presents from everyone, and now even you, too… Today's just filled with wonderful things!
{% endbubble %}

<div class="msr-narration">
    <p>You got a mountain of them, right?</p>
</div>

{% bubble Chiaki grin2 %}
Yeah! I was so surprised; I never once expected to get that many!

Everyone's presents are filled with their sincere feelings… It reminded me all over again that I'm blessed with so many wonderful comrades and friends.
{% endbubble %}

#### <div mt="rare"></div> 3/3

{% bubble Chiaki %}
I got to take my time talking with everyone in Ryuseitai today, which made me really happy.

On top of that, all of my classmates from 3-A got together, like how we were talking in the staff cafeteria earlier in the afternoon.

We had a lot of fun talking about all sorts of things, like when we went to the arcade together back when we were still in Yumenosaki~♪[^1]
{% endbubble %}

<div class="msr-narration">
    <p>It's like a class reunion, isn't it?</p>
</div>

{% bubble Chiaki grin2 %}
Yep! Graduation means we no longer get together in one place anymore, but—

I got to remember how it feels to be a student again at my party, and that was so much fun…☆
{% endbubble %}

### Birthday Night, Part Two

#### <div mt="rare"></div> 1/3

{% bubble Chiaki awkward %}
Oh, I'm so sorry. I did nothing but talk about myself again…

It's so easy to talk to you, Anzu, that I couldn't help myself.

I assume this box is my present? Could I open it right now?
{% endbubble %}

<div class="msr-narration">
    <p>Go ahead!</p>
</div>

{% bubble Chiaki %}
Ohh, a brooch! The deep blue color is really pretty!

If I clip this on, I'll be Morisawa Blue! Let me try putting it on!
{% endbubble %}

#### <div mt="rare"></div> 2/3

{% img /img/es/birthdaystory/es2/chiaki/birthdaynight2_1.jpg %}

{% bubble Chiaki grin2 %}
Ha ha ha!! ☆ Morisawa Blue has arrived~!

Fufu, just kidding. Getting a present made me over excited~♪

It's such an impressive-looking brooch, that it could even be used as a hero transformation item.
{% endbubble %}

<div class="msr-narration">
    <p>Rather, it's more like…</p>
</div>

{% bubble Chiaki %}
It's more like an item from a show for girls? True, its design is probably much closer to the ones you see in those shows.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki northinking %}
For those shows, the catchphrase when they transform is different from heroes, right? I wonder what sort of catchphrase I should go with?
{% endbubble %}

#### <div mt="rare"></div> 3/3

{% bubble Chiaki %}
Anzu, thank you for everything you've done for me during the party.

I also heard you made sure to adjust my schedule so that I could participate in my party.

Thanks to you, I got to have a wonderful day today…☆
{% endbubble %}

<div class="msr-narration">
    <p>I'm glad I was helpful.</p>
</div>

{% bubble Chiaki srsthinking %}
I'm guessing you wouldn't let me repay you even if I asked you to, huh…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki grin2 %}
So instead, just make sure to call for me if you're ever in trouble! I'll do everything I can for the sake of protecting your smile, Anzu!
{% endbubble %}

## Birthday Phone Call

{% bubble Chiaki grin2 %}
Helloo~! It's me! I felt like I needed to let you know just how grateful I am for today.

Thank you so much for such a special birthday today! I swear to you that I'll treasure the gift you gave me for the rest of my life! ♪
