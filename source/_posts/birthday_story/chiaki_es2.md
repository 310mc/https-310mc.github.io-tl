You get to play games and answer questions from fans in the birthday event, right?

If I remember clearly, Sengoku showed off his ninja techniques, and Nagumo had a work-out session with everyone…

I could tell it was super fun to share their hobbies and specialties with their fans!

Right then, Nagumo! Let's continue sending out the heart of justice together! Fuhahahaha! ☆
{% endbubble %}

### With Midori

{% bubble Chiaki %}
Hm? Oh, is that you over there, Takamine!? I knew you'd come to my birthday party! Why didn't you tell me you were around? ♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
'Cause I *knew* this'd happen… *Sigh*, I knew I shouldn't have come…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki %}
Don't be that way! I'm happy to see you here, y'know!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
Ughhh, please don't yell near my ear…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki %}
Aaalright, Takamine! Now that the five of us are all here, let's take a photo together to commemorate!
{% endbubble %}

{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Hiiro %}
Hm? Yes, that's right! You are my comrade, and I'm quite indebted to you. It's only natural that I would celebrate your birthday!

I also prepared a present, so please open it at a later time, if that's alright with you. I bought it from the shopping center, so it should hopefully not be anything strange…

## Birthday Event

{% img /img/es/birthdaystory/es2/chiaki/birthdayevent.jpg %}

### Opening Talk
{% bubble Chiaki %}
Hey, everyone! Thank you so much for coming over to my birthday event!

I can’t even begin to describe how happy I am to see so many of you here, just to celebrate my birthday!

But! I don’t plan to make you all do the work! I’ve got a bunch of stuff prepared to get you all hyped up for my birthday!

We’ll only get to be together for a short while, but that’s why I want everyone to enjoy this as much as they can, so we can all make memories together!

Alright, are you ready? Let’s get things started!
{% endbubble %}

Let's make today a day<br>to remember forever!|Alright, are you all ready?
:-:|:-:

### Question Corner
{% bubble Chiaki %}
Let’s start with the Question Corner! All your questions are on this card, so let’s get through them!
Right, first question! “Have you ever felt scared while doing your stunts?”

Hmm… It would’ve made me look cool if I said “absolutely never,” but I’ve had moments where I cut it too close. But don’t worry, everyone ends up being satisfied with the shooting once it’s all done and over with!

Alright, next question! “What makes tokusatsu shows so good?”

Great question! That’d of course be: the bonds betweens comrades! The passionate, deep friendships! And the courage of facing any and all hardships!

Oh, and I love how it’s always about justice prevailing no matter what!
{% endbubble %}

Tokusatsu is great! You should all check it out, too!|I wish I had more time to mention everything I love about it!

### Request Corner
{% bubble Chiaki %}
Next up: the Request Corner! Thank you for all your requests! The one I’ll be doing is… “I want to see your basketball skills”!

I wasn’t sure what to do for this, but I’ve decided to start from the basics, which is dribbling! We’ve got some evenly-spaced cones here, so I’ll be dribbling through them!

…♪ All this dribbling reminds me of the days I’d play basketball with Akehoshi, Isara, and Takamine.

This is where you’re meant to get past the defense, and take the perfect layup shot!

—But sadly, I’d hurt someone if I actually threw the ball, so I’ll just demonstrate how it would look! ……Did you guys enjoy that?

This is commonly taught in school, so you might’ve already seen it before. I’d love it if you could try it out the next time you play basketball!
{% endbubble %}

This is the basics of basketball,<br>but it’s fundamental for a reason!|It’s a lot of fun to do physical exercise!

### Surprise Corner
{% bubble Chiaki %}
…Hm? The staff brought over a present box. May I open it?

Alright, I got the OK! Let’s go!

…Ohh? I got three cards filled with messages! The first one… is from Ryuseitai!

Can you guys see it from your seats? It says “Happy birthday” in the middle, with stars in our colors all over the card! It’s so cool!

I got another card from Sports Survival, and the last one is from Shin Circle! They’ve all got such heart-warming messages written on them…!

Oh, I can’t hold back my happiness anymore! I feel so much warmth deep in my soul…! I’ll take my sweet time reading them later, and engrave their messages deep inside me…!
{% endbubble %}

I’m so close to tearing up…!|Thanks for today, everyone!

### Ending Talk
{% bubble Chiaki %}
Everything comes to an end, huh… I knew that already, but it’s still sad to need to say goodbye to everyone.

However! That sort of mood doesn’t suit me! Instead, I’m going to wish you all goodbye with a smile on my face, to the very end!

Thank you so, so much for today! I’m so happy I got to see so many smiles from everyone!

Your smiles and cheers is all it takes to push me a step forward!

I’ll keep working hard to the best of my abilities as a hero and an idol!

So please keep cheering for Ryuseitai! I hope I get to see you all again sometime!

## Translation Notes

[^1]: Shinobu says this phrase a lot, so there's an implication that Chiaki's copying after him.
