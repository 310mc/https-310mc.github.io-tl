Ahaha, 'course I would! It's *your* birthday!

I'm gonna work hard to become an even more super reliable, manly man! So I want you to watch over me, Senpai!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki %}
Oh…! Alright then! Your feelings of passion have touched my heart!

Right then, Nagumo! Let's continue sending out the heart of justice together! Fuhahahaha! ☆
{% endbubble %}

### With Midori

{% bubble Chiaki %}
Hm? Oh, is that you over there, Takamine!? I knew you'd come to my birthday party! Why didn't you tell me you were around? ♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
'Cause I *knew* this'd happen… *Sigh*, I knew I shouldn't have come…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki %}
Don't be that way! I'm happy to see you here, y'know!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
Ughhh, please don't yell near my ear…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki %}
Aaalright, Takamine! Now that the five of us are all here, let's take a photo together to commemorate!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
Whaaa…? Jeez, fine… It *is* your birthday today, so I'll go along with it.

Happy birthday, Morisawa-senpai…♪
{% endbubble %}

### With Shinobu

{% bubble Shinobu %}
Happy birthday, Morisawa-dono~♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki %}
Woah—! S-Sengoku!? I couldn't even tell you were nearby until you greeted me!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shinobu %}
Heheh~ That's because I used my ninjutsu to sneak up on you~♪ I've brought you a present, too.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki %}
Ohh! It's a headband! Wait, is this… the one that Ninja Red wore?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shinobu %}
Indeed! I got this for you, because I thought you'd also enjoy this type of ninja gear. I would like you to take it for yourself, if that's alright~♪

Thank you, Sengoku! I'm going to take great care of it…♪
{% endbubble %}

Happy birthday, Chiaki-senpai. I've come to celebrate!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki %}
Ohh! Thank you, Hero-kun!

I'm so happy to know that even *you've* come to my birthday party! This must surely be because an ally of justice would never pass the opportunity to celebrate their comrade's birthday! ☆
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Hiiro %}
Hm? Yes, that's right! You are my comrade, and I'm quite indebted to you. It's only natural that I would celebrate your birthday!

I also prepared a present, so please open it at a later time, if that's alright with you. I bought it from the shopping center, so it should hopefully not be anything strange…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki %}
Ha ha ha!! ♪ It's a present you bought just for me, so I'll be happy with anything! Thank you so much, Hero-kun…☆

{% bubble Chiaki %}
You get to play games and answer questions from fans in the birthday event, right?

If I remember clearly, Sengoku showed off his ninja techniques, and Nagumo had a work-out session with everyone…

I could tell it was super fun to share their hobbies and specialties with their fans!

### Opening Speech
{% bubble Chiaki %}
Hey, everyone! Thank you so much for coming over to my birthday event!

I can’t even begin to describe how happy I am to see so many of you here, just to celebrate my birthday!

But! I don’t plan to make you all do the work! I’ve got a bunch of stuff prepared to get you all hyped up for my birthday!

We’ll only get to be together for a short while, but that’s why I want everyone to enjoy this as much as they can, so we can all make memories together!

Alright, are you ready? Let’s get things started!
{% endbubble %}

<img class="msr-tippy" img src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/ensemble-stars/images/e/ef/Chiaki_Morisawa_Work_Birthday_Flowers_Chibi_6.png" width="150" data-tippy-content="Let's make today a day to remember forever!">|<img class="msr-tippy" img src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/ensemble-stars/images/4/42/Chiaki_Morisawa_Work_Birthday_Flowers_Chibi_5.png" width="150" data-tippy-content="Alright, are you all ready?">

### Question Segment
{% bubble Chiaki %}
Let’s start with the Question Corner! All your questions are on this card, so let’s get through them!
Right, first question! “Have you ever felt scared while doing your stunts?”

Hmm… It would’ve made me look cool if I said “absolutely never,” but I’ve had moments where I cut it too close. But don’t worry, everyone ends up being satisfied with the shooting once it’s all done and over with!

Alright, next question! “What makes tokusatsu shows so good?”

Great question! That’d of course be: the bonds betweens comrades! The passionate, deep friendships! And the courage of facing any and all hardships!

Oh, and I love how it’s always about justice prevailing no matter what!

### Request Segment
{% bubble Chiaki %}
Next up: the Request Segment! Thank you for all your requests! The one I’ll be doing is… “I want to see your basketball skills”!

I wasn’t sure what to do for this, but I decided to start from the basics, which is dribbling! We’ve got some evenly-spaced cones here, so I’ll be dribbling through them!

…♪ All this dribbling reminds me of the days I’d play basketball with Akehoshi, Isara, and Takamine.

This is where you’re meant to get past the defense, and take the perfect layup shot!

—But sadly, I’d hurt someone if I actually threw the ball, so I’ll just demonstrate how it would look! ……Did you guys enjoy that?

This is commonly taught in school, so you might’ve already seen it before. I’d love it if you could try it out the next time you play basketball!
{% endbubble %}

### Surprise Segment
{% bubble Chiaki %}
…Hm? The staff brought over a present box. May I open it?

Alright, I got the OK! Let’s go!

…Ohh? I got three cards filled with messages! The first one… is from Ryuseitai!

Can you guys see it from your seats? It says “Happy birthday” in the middle, with stars in our colors all over the card! It’s so cool!

I got another card from Sports Survivors, and the last one is from Shin Circle! They’ve all got such heart-warming messages written on them…!

Oh, I can’t hold back my happiness anymore! I feel so much warmth deep in my soul…! I’ll take my sweet time reading them later, and engrave their messages deep inside me…!
{% endbubble %}

<img class="msr-tippy" img src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/ensemble-stars/images/1/17/Chiaki_Morisawa_Work_Birthday_Flowers_Chibi_8.png" width="150" data-tippy-content="I’m so close to tearing up…!">|<img class="msr-tippy" img src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/ensemble-stars/images/e/ef/Chiaki_Morisawa_Work_Birthday_Flowers_Chibi_6.png" width="150" data-tippy-content="Thanks for today, everyone!">

<center><i>Hover/Click the chibi to see the quote!</i></center>

### Closing Speech
{% bubble Chiaki %}
Everything comes to an end, huh… I knew that already, but it’s still sad to need to say goodbye to everyone.

However! That sort of mood doesn’t suit me! Instead, I’m going to wish you all goodbye with a smile on my face, to the very end!

Thank you so, so much for today! I’m so happy I got to see so many smiles from everyone!

Your smiles and cheers is all it takes to push me a step forward!

I’ll keep working hard to the best of my abilities as a hero and an idol!

So please keep cheering for Ryuseitai! I hope I get to see you all again sometime!

### Opening Speech
{% bubble Chiaki %}
Thanks for coming to my birthday party, everyone!

We don't tend to get many opportunities to gather all in the same place, so I really mean it when I say I'm happy to see you all here…♪

And for that reason, I want us all to have a blast together!

Enjoy yourselves to your heart's content today! ☆ Alright, that's all I wanted to say!

### Food Talk
{% bubble Kaoru %}
Yoohoo, Moricchi! Happy birthday~♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki %}
Thank you, Hakaze! Nothing makes me happier than being wished a happy birthday directly…♪

Oh yeah, I left some pancakes for you over there, so go ahead and eat them! You're free to add as much cream as you like, too! ☆
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kaoru %}
Woah, you remembered my favorite food?

That reminds me though, there were a lot of French fries prepared, too. It's your birthday and all, so eat up as much as you like.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki %}
Oh! So we both remembered each other's favorite food, huh? I truly feel our bond of friendship…☆
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kaoru %}
Ahaha, you're over-exaggerating… But hey, since it's your birthday party, let's eat together. We'll grab some drinks, too~♪

### Presents from ES Idols
{% bubble Chiaki %}
Wow, I didn't expect to be surrounded by so many presents…!

Everyone brought all these presents, just for me…! Uuu, I'm getting so emotional just thinking about it…

Alrighty, I'll start by opening this one up!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Adonis %}
That would be my gift. Happy birthday, Morisawa-senpai.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki %}
Ohhh!? This is yours, Otogari!? Is it meat? Tell me, is it meat!?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Adonis %}
I would love to say yes, but I gifted you something else. It would have been difficult to prepare meat as a birthday present. I do hope you'll like it, however…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki %}
Alright, let me see… Ohh, a gym bag!? This'll come in handy for both Shin *and* Sports Survivors! ♪ Thank you, Otogari!

### Birthday Wishes from ES Idols
{% bubble Chiaki %}
Ah, there he is! Heeey, Takamine\~!! ☆ Are you eating well\~!?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
Uuu… This is so embarrassing, I just *had* to have the main lead of the party yell out for me, and then start getting insanely worried over me in front of <em>everybody</em>… He's so insensitive…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mao %}
Aw c'mon, it just means that you're getting doted on by Morisawa-senpai, right?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki %}
Ohh! Isara, you were with Takamine!? I assure you that both of you are my adorable juniors! There, there, c'mere~! ☆
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mao %}
Ahaha, your habit of hugging as soon as you can hasn't changed, huh?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
Meh, I'll go along with it for today… Since you just love to goof off with your juniors no matter how old you get…

### Closing Speech
{% bubble Chiaki %}
Time sure flies when you're having fun…

I told you all to enjoy yourselves to your heart's content, but I think *I'm* the one who ended up having fun the most…

But I enjoyed myself this much *because* you were all laughing and having a great time! Your smiles were the best present I could have~♪

As both a hero and an idol, I'll work harder than ever for the sake of seeing your wonderful smiles on my next birthday! ☆
