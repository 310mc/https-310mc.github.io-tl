You are impeccable as always, Anzu-dono! You prepared such a grand party in such a short amount of time…!

Your dexterity shows you, too, have what it takes to be a ninja—

Mm? What do you have in your hand?

            Ah, this is a teddy bear. Heheheh, how adorable, it's holding a cookie! ♪

            Ohh, I can attach it to my clothes through this pin… Thank you for the lovely present, Anzu-dono!

            I see, so a teddy bear that has my name on it… How elaborate! This acts as proof that I am the main lead of this party, correct?

            Very well then, I'll clip it on… What do you think? Does it suit me?

It is difficult to choose from such a tasty assortment of food! ♪

Mm, perhaps I should start with salad, as a starter… Ah, but the food over there looks tasty too, and I'm curious about the drinks~…

Anzu-dono, what will you have first?

            You even prepared hyorogan food!? Mmm, it's true that I cannot ignore such food as a ninja, but… It will make me full…

            I can take it with me? Very well then, I shall take it with me as a souvenir~♪

            Hmhm, we *are* having a feast after all, one must start with a cheers! You're correct as always, Anzu-dono.

            You prepared an umeboshi drink for me? Ah, I have to drink that, it's my favorite! Right then… Cheers~♪

Ah—! It's already this late… Unfortunately, we must call it an end here.

Once I head back to my room, I plan to sleep after I take a good look at all the presents people brought me.

Anzu-dono, thank you very much for preparing this birthday party for me~♪

            Of course! The proof of that is my smile all throughout the party!

            It motivated me to work hard and grow more as an idol and ninja! Please do continue supporting me, Anzu-dono~♪

            Hmm… Well, I feel as though we would have a lot of fun if everyone could be ninjas together, and show off our ninja art… However, I don't particularly have anything I want either way.

            I'm happy enough just knowing people want to celebrate my birthday~♪
