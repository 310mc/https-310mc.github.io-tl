## Birthday Story

### Chiaki

{% bubble Chiaki %}
Fuhahahaha! Happy birthday, Kanata!

Wow, so many people have gathered here just to celebrate your birthday…☆

Seeing you surrounded by your comrades and the children, and smiling so happily…! It makes me awfully emotional!

Sorry, sorry. I wasn’t planning on crying or anything, but I just got so into it. Ha ha ha~! ♪

Oh, uh, now you’ve pat me on the head… I’m here to show my gratitude and to celebrate your birthday, but I’m getting comforted by you instead…

Aaalright then! I have to redeem my honor right here! We’ll call over the Ryuseitai kids and perform a special live show together~♪
{% endbubble %}

### Tetora

{% bubble Tetora %}
Erm, okay. Shinkai-senpai, happy birthday!

Truth is, I, uh… always thought you were a weird person.

But now I really respect you as someone great like, I’m always thinking, “wow, as expected from someone of the Three Oddballs.”

And so, Shinkai-senpai! Please teach me about more and more stuff! I’d appreciate it!

Uoohh\~?! You’re okay with it?! Thank you so much\~!

…Hm? You’ll start by teaching me how to *puka puka*?

O-Ossu! I gotcha! I’ll *puka puka* like my entire life’s counting on it~!
{% endbubble %}

### Midori

{% bubble Midori %}
Shinkai-senpai… I’m really sorry for forgetting your birthday…

I’m just awful, aren’t I… You came to celebrate my birthday yesterday… and even gifted me a cute mascot character plushie, I still went and forgot all about it…

Uuu, please don’t be kind to me… It’s fine, you can curse at me and hate me… I’m ready for it… I think…

Sigh… It’s your birthday of all things, and now I’ve ruined the mood with my moping…

I’m gonna make up for all of this, I swear… I’ll even buy you a present…

I really *do* wanna celebrate your birthday, so please accept my present once I’ve bought it… I’ll be really glad… Happy birthday, Shinkai-senpai…
{% endbubble %}

### Shinobu

{% bubble Shinobu %}
Shinkai-dono! Happy birthday!

Are you enjoying the party we prepared for you?

If there's anything you wish to change about it, you can always inform me!

Heheh. I’m always in your debt, so I want to make you happy, even if just by a little bit.

Since there's the expression of “Mother Ocean,” you have somewhat of a motherly-feel to you within Ryuseitai, you see.

I’m still a novice compared to Tetora-kun and Midori-kun, but I’ll keep working harder and harder in order to show my respect and care for my seniors~♪
{% endbubble %}

### Kaoru

{% bubble Kaoru %}
Kanata-kun, yoohoo\~♪ Happy birthday\~ Are you having a blast?

Hey, wait. I asked you earlier if you wanted to come with me to the ocean, but you refused 'cause it’s too hot to move! And now you came to this party when Anzu-chan asked you?

Although, I mean… if I were invited somewhere with her, I’d go without condition too, but…

It’s not like I was planning to surprise you with something, y’know\~? I was just thinking of walking on the beach a little, so I invited you over as well\~♪

Hmm? You’ll join me once the sun goes down and it starts to get cooler?

Ahaha, thanks. But for now, just enjoy your party. It’s not really like me to do this, but I’ll try and make things exciting here for you~♪
{% endbubble %}

### Souma

{% bubble Souma v3 %}
Happy birthday, Buchou-dono. Kanzaki Souma has now arrived.

I apologize for the sudden request, but may you please accept my present for you?

Last night, I prepared multiple types of sushi in order to make them for you! They are raw of course, so I would like you to eat them as soon as possible. ♪

Huh—? Have I made too many…? It has covered the entire “tay-bul”…

I was imagining your joyful face while making them, thus I ended up with this much before I noticed.

It is perfectly fine to offer it to the people gathered here. We will make this a sushi “par-tii”…♪
{% endbubble %}

### Wataru

{% bubble Wataru %}
Kanata! Happy birthday…! ☆

How joyful! We’ve managed to gather here for the sake of celebrating a dear, beloved old friend’s birthday~♪

Although, if we could just come to school properly, we would be able to see each other practically every day, yes?

But let us leave that aside for now! I’ve prepared a present specifically for you. Please watch closely… One, Two, *Amazing*!

Yes, an inflatable pool. Please do use it and *puka puka* wherever you please, whenever you like! *Fufufu*!

It is an extreme honor to know it made you happy! There’s already water inside, so it’s completely alright to go ahead and soak yourself anytime~♪
{% endbubble %}

### Natsume

{% bubble Natsume %}
Kanata-niisan, happy birthday…♪

Sorry about Earlier. You were surprised to see us show ourselves with water guns in our hands, weren’t You?

Ahaha, I’m glad to know you enjoyed It. Cleaning this room will be hard work now that the whole place is drenched with Water, though…

But eh, you’re probably happy with it being this Way. Go ahead and try out the present from Wataru-niisan, too. For his Sake.

*Fufufu*. The rest of the guests here will be unhappy if you keep having fun with us Only.

I’ll be more respectful and keep it Down, and tell the rest of my niisans to do the Same. So just enjoy your day as much as you want, Kanata-niisan~♪
