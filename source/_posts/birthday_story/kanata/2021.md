What do you typically do in a birthday event…? I'd like to know how it was for other idols, so that I may use it as reference.

Hm, hm… So fans can ask questions for the question segment… What will my fans ask me~?

And there's a request segment, too? I'd like to make sure I can meet their expectations… I wonder what they'll request from me…?

{% bubble Kanata v2 %}
hello, everyone\~♪ welcome to my [birthday event]~♪

i am so happy to see you all here to celebrate my [birthday]~♪

i was so excited for this [event], that i woke up earlier than usual~♪

but it meant i could take my time [soaking] in [water], so it was a [productive] morning for me.

i want to do a lot of fun things with everyone today, so i have a lot [planned] for us~

i hope you enjoy yourselves until the very end~♪ okay then, let's begin…♪
{% endbubble %}

### Question Segment

{% bubble Kanata v2 %}
first we have the [question segment]. thank you for all your [questions]~♪ i will choose a few and answer them.

okay, first [question]: "is there any cute deep-sea fish?"

yes~♪ the [careproctus] fish is pretty [cute]. it has round, adorable eyes, with a [silky smooth] body.

but nobody really [agrees] with me when i say that… i wonder why?

next [question]: "do you like fish-based dishes?"

yes, i love them. all of [them] are so tasty, be it [sashimi] or [grilled fish]… [fishies] are incredible, aren't they? ♪

waah\~♪ this is such a lovely [request]\~♪ this is the perfect opportunity to [promote] the [ocean]\~

did you all know that most of the [water] in the world is located in the [ocean]?

and if you were to [weigh] all the [creatures] on earth, it would be about the same [weight] as the [marine] animals.

that is how amazing the [ocean] is\~♪ you will discover even more interesting facts if you learn more about [it]\~♪

…ah! a lot of [fish toys] are inside! how cute~♪

there is a [letter] in here, too. umm~ "happy birthday, shinkai-dono!"

"this is a [present] from all of us in [oceans]. we would be glad if you bring along these toys with you when you puka puka".[^1]
