Uwaah, thank you for doing all of this for me…! You even prepared a mascot-themed cake for my birthday~♪

## Party at the Agency

#### <div mt="rare"></div> 1/3

{% img /img/es/birthdaystory/es2/midori/party_1.jpg %}

{% bubble Midori %}
Ahh, it's already my birthday… Time sure flies…

I've been at everyone else's birthday parties, so I was more or less prepared for this to happen, but…

It still feels kinda embarrassing. We've got Shinkai-senpai's birthday to celebrate tomorrow, so how about we call it a day instead…?

              Thank you very much. I'm sorry for being rude, especially when you took the time to prepare everything for me…

              I mean, I'm happy that I get to celebrate my birthday here, but… I feel bad that you've prepared *this* much for me…

              —No, I shouldn't think negatively about this… right? I'll be sure to enjoy the party.

              Ahaha… You saying that with a smile on your face stopped me from getting any more negative.

              Thank you so much for preparing this all for me.

              Birthdays happen only once a year, so I'll make sure to avoid saying anything negative for the day.

              No! That's not what I meant. It's just— It feels nerve-racking to have your birthday party at an agency…

              Ahh, but I really need to stop moping like that… It'd be rude to everyone who came over to celebrate.

              Now that the party is here and ready for me, I'll just enjoy myself for the day.

Ah, Miss Producer. Thank you for your hard work today.

That's a large box you're holding. Would you like help carrying it?

It's full of presents for me…? I've gotten so many by now, who could they be from?

              He told me about how tasty this bakery's bread was a few days ago. I think I'll eat it with everyone now that we're all here together.

              Heheh, they all look so tasty — I dunno what to eat first.

              He's very diligent about these things, isn't he? But I've been getting along with him lately at the Manga Club, so I'm happy to get a present from him~♪

              It says "Enjoy as a hot driNK" on the birthday card. This is just getting more cryptic…

              It's from Shino-kun. "Happy birthday"… His hand writing is as soothing as his presence is~♪

              I'll have to thank him later. Thank you for handing it to me, Miss Producer.

{% bubble Midori %}
Thank you for your hard work, Miss Producer.

Haah, it's finally over… It's waaay easier celebrating someone else's birthday over your own.

I'm really just not made to be the main role of anything…

              But… you're right. I have juniors now, I need to make sure to be in the spotlight more.

              I can't call myself a "main role" of anything yet… but I don't think my old self could've ever imagined me being this positive about my future.

              Tomorrow's Shinkai-senpai's birthday, so I'll help you out. I'm good at labor work, so…

              Ever since I joined the agency, I haven't been able to hang out with everyone in Ryuseitai outside of work as much.

              Tetora-kun and Shinobu-kun looked happy about it too — I'm so glad… Thank you so much for making this party for me.

## Birthday Story

### With Chiaki

{% bubble Chiaki %}
Fuhahahaha! Takamine, happy birthday!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori v2 %}
Ugh— S-Stay away from me…!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki %}
What's up, what's wrong? Why're you stepping away from me? That'll make me feel lonely, Takamine…!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori v2 %}
You hugged Tetora-kun and Shinobu-kun on their birthdays, didn't you…? I've been dreading the day you'd do the same to me…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki %}
Ohhh, I get it now! You wanted me to hug you, didn't you? I'm sorry for not noticing sooner! Well then, here I go— *squeeeze~♪*
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori v2 %}
No, I'm trying to say the opposite here — Ahhh, jeez, you're so suffocating…!
{% endbubble %}

### With Kanata

{% bubble Kanata v2 %}
midori~ happy [birthday].

i brought you [that thing] you have wanted for so long…♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
The Kanatee plushie that was only sold on Marine Day!? It sold out five seconds after release and was gone just like that…!

C-Can I really have this for myself?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata v2 %}
yes. that is why i brought it, after all. i found the very last one lying deep in the [storehouse]. please give it lots and lots of love, okay?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
The last one…? Thank you so, so much. I'll be sure to treasure it…♪
{% endbubble %}

### With Tetora

{% bubble Tetora %}
Happy birthday, Midori-kun!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
Thank you… Isn't this rough for all of you..? I mean, Shinkai-senpai's birthday is literally the day after mine.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora %}
Huh? Why would it be? There's no way we'd have a rough time when it comes to birthday celebrations.

I'm actually happy! 'Cuz I get to tell you happy birthday from the bottom of my heart!

Keep tomorrow's plans for tomorrow, and for today, let's celebrate your birthday with all we've got~!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
"All we've got"…? Ahaha, you sure are full of energy, Tetora-kun.
{% endbubble %}

### With Shinobu

{% bubble Shinobu %}
Midori-kun, happy birthday! I'm so happy we get to celebrate your birthday together again~♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
Mhm, me too… Though I'm still not used to celebrating it outside of my family…

But I think I feel relaxed, since I know practically everyone here — Like, it doesn't feel too bad being here, I think…

Ah, that's right… The producer made the cake for me. It's got Ryuseitai's colors on it…

I can't eat it all on my own, so let's eat it with everyone.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shinobu %}
Yes, let's! I'll go prepare the plates and call everyone over!
{% endbubble %}

### With Tatsumi

{% bubble Tatsumi %}
Happy birthday, Takamine-san. May light shine upon your future. Amen. ♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
Wow… It feels really genuine when it's said in a form of a prayer.

Ah— I'm so sorry. I think I was being rude there, wasn't I…?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tatsumi %}
Oh, never. I would be rather glad to know if you felt a connection with it. Religious faith was never something to be afraid of.

We may spend time together at Gardenia, but I still don't know you particularly well yet. I hope that we will be able to deepen our bond in the future.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
Ah, yes… If you're fine with talking to me, then I'd be glad to.
