A-Anzu-san… Hello. Do you have work to do as a producer today, even during the summer holidays?

Hm? Me…? I was asleep, but then Morisawa-senpai suddenly invaded my home…

Then he called out to me saying, "I took your favorite cushion as hostage! If you're a hero, then come and save it!"

              Morisawa-senpai ruined one of my other favorite cushions before, too.[^1]

              Disaster doesn't even *begin* to describe how it—… The truth is, today's my birthday…

              And my parents told me that I don't have to help out at the greengrocer for today, so I really thought I'd be able to sleep as much as I like…

              *Siiiiigh*… Why do I have to come to school, of all places…

You said you'd take me to where Morisawa-senpai is, so I followed you, but… All of a sudden I have to wear this, too… Just what is—

Wait, now that I think about it, haven't I seen this sash before…?

Is it for a birthday party… Like, mine…?

              This is the first time someone else has done something like this for me, so I'm not exactly sure how to react…

## Birthday Story

### Chiaki

{% bubble Chiaki %}
Today is your birthday, Takamine! Happy birthday, Takamine…! ☆

……

Hmm? No response? I don’t need one! I’m waiting right here with my arms wide open, so leap into my arms anytime!

“Why”? …Well, isn’t it more strange *not* to hug someone on the annual day of something this special?

I had a passionate embrace with Nagumo and Sengoku on their birthdays, so there’s no way I wouldn’t do the same with you! ♪

And so, without further ado! Come over, Takamine! If you won’t, I’ll do it myself~ Fuhahahahaha!! ☆
{% endbubble %}

### Kanata

{% bubble Kanata v2 %}

{% endbubble %}

### Tetora

{% bubble Tetora %}
Ossu! Midori-kun, happy birthday!

Heh, you’ve finally caught up with me and Sengoku-kun. Now we’re all the same age~♪

It’s not that big of a difference? I mean, that’s true, but…

You’re tall, so you look mature, yeah? But your birthday is after both of us, so…

Heheh! ♪ It feels like a good balance between the three of us!

Ah—But I wanna grow taller myself, so hmm…

Midori-kun, you don’t have to grow any bigger, ‘kay? Ooooh\~!!! I’m gonna do my best to surpass you\~! ☆
{% endbubble %}

### Shinobu

{% bubble Shinobu v2 %}
Happy birthday, Midori-kun~♪

Nishishi, our surprise party was a huge success\~! You see, we'd been planning for this day in secret\~♪

Huh!? You noticed how we were whispering to each other about something?

U-Uuu~ I really *should've* taken the initiative and hid everything from you… The ninja path is truly steep…

…“This is the first time people have celebrated my birthday like this, so I’m actually really happy”?

Wooo\~! Midori-kun said he's *happy*! And he even smiled at me in a really nice way\~!

A*hem*. If you enjoyed it, then that's enough for me…♪
{% endbubble %}

### Subaru

{% bubble Subaru %}
Takamin, happy birthday~☆

Huh? Why do you look surprised? You were sparkling and smiling just a second ago~!

Yep, yep, you were smiling reaaally nice! I could never imagine the usual you doing that~♪

C’mon, smile like you were a second ago\~ I loooved it\~! ☆

Oh wait, right… Sari~ told me a bunch of stuff earlier. Stuff like, “don’t just say whatever comes on your mind”…

Was what I said just now alright? Tell me if it wasn’t, ‘kay? I don’t wanna ruin your birthday…

Imma get super pumped and have a blast so I can get to see you do that sparkly smile again~! ♪
{% endbubble %}

### Mao

{% bubble Mao %}
“Takamine-kun, happy birthday-bon!”

Haha~ Yep, yep, it’s Basket-bon, the basketball fairy. I’m glad you still remember it.[^3]

I thought doing this'd make you smile, but I didn’t even need to worry about needing to do that, huh?

Your Ryuseitai pals and friends all came, and they’re having a real blast with you here.

I thought maybe I could also do a comedy skit with Subaru for you, although I'm only expecting that to fail…… Hm? You wanna see it?

Wait, wait. So you *want* us to fail? …Wow, you really look like you wanna see this.

Alright, alright. I’ll do it just for you! You’re today’s protagonist, after all! Happy birthday, Takamine!
{% endbubble %}

### Tomoya

{% bubble Tomoya %}
Takamine, today’s your birthday, right? Happy birthday~♪

“Thank you very much,” he says… Why’re you being so formal? We’re classmates, aren’t we?

Ahh, yep. I came here with Hajime, but… It’s not like I was against it, y’know?

I even bought you a present. Look, it’s mascot merch!

Of *course* I know you like this stuff. I’m pretty sure almost everyone in class knows you love mascot characters.

Don’t look so surprised and just take your gift, c’mon. Happy birthday, Takamine~♪
{% endbubble %}

### Hajime

{% bubble Hajime %}
Happy birthday, Takamine-kun…♪

I heard today was your birthday, so I came over to celebrate~♪

Wawa— Why are you bowing your head down in apology? Please, you don’t have to feel guilty about this~!

I didn’t come here because I had spare time during my summer break! I came because I wanted to celebrate your birthday~

Yes~♪ We are classmates, after all—I would love to get closer to you.

Ehehe. I hope we can get along once the next terms begins, Takamine-kun…♪
