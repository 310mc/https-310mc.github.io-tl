Ah—Anzu-san. I'm so sorry, I couldn't get the chance to talk to you from how busy the party has been.

I'm the "main protagonist" for today, so I thought I should actually put in the effort…

Uu… But I've been so nervous that I've barely eaten anything… I'm starving…

### Opening Speech

{% bubble Midori %}
Ummm, thank you all for coming here today…

To be honest, I feel sorta bad to have so much prepared just for *me*… But I enjoyed everyone else's birthday parties, so…

I'd like to make sure you all enjoy mine just the same, instead of regretting coming by… so I hope you enjoy yourselves here…

<th>(…Uuu… Maybe I'm being way too self-conscious by thinking they're all here just for my sake… I'm so embarrassed…)</th>

<th>(But I think it should be fine to admit it, just for today… After all, everyone prepared this just for me, so I gotta show confidence in myself for once…!)</th>

### Closing Speech

{% bubble Midori %}
Thank you all for coming today. I had a lot of fun thanks to everyone…

…Um, is it just me, or does Morisawa-senpai have tears in his eyes…? …You're getting emotional 'cause of how much I've grown…?

Uuu, this is super embarrassing somehow… Never mind, I'm ending my speech here… I forgot everything I wanted to say 'cause of Morisawa-senpai.

…But… I should be grateful that there *are* people who're happy to see me grow, shouldn't I?

I'll keep working hard on improving myself, as both an ally and a rival… So I hope we can continue supporting each other.
