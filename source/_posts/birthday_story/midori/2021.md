## Event Preparations

{% bubble Midori %}
Umm… After this, I’ll have to try out the outfits for tomorrow, and then…

…*Sigh*. I showed up to the practice session today, but I have a photoshoot for a magazine tomorrow… *again*? I’m grateful for these jobs, but I really miss veggies…

Ahh, Anzu-san, hello. I hope work has been going well… Is there something wrong?

            You wanna know what I’ve got planned for the end of this month? Well… I guess I’m free?

            Huh? An event to celebrate my birthday? Umm… You don’t have to go that far for me, though…

            I’ve been so busy the past few days… I know it’s a good thing, but I kinda wanna do something else for once…

            Ah, that doesn’t mean I won’t be working hard at my job. I’m doing what I can, so… yeah, you’re free to talk to me about anything related to work.

            Plans… Does that mean it’s a new job for me? …No, wait, I’m an idol, so of course that’s what it’d be…

            Huh!? A birthday event for me? I did hear about Tetora-kun and Shinobu-kun doing that, but one for *me* as well…?

{% bubble Midori %}
Umm, please hold on for a moment. When you say my own birthday event… Do you mean one where I’m the main lead?

I’m just a regular ol’ highschool student, and I’m still not even comfortable having my photo taken in public…

And do people really wanna see me do it that badly…? What am I gonna do if I fail… Ahhh, this is so depressing, I wanna die…

            Ah—that’s the keychain strap of that trending mascot character, right? I remember it being advertised… Are you giving it to me?

            It’s themed after veggies, so it soothes me just by looking at it… I’m sorry about earlier, I feel a lot calmer now.

            I’ll be receiving requests and questions from my fans, so I don’t have to come up with my own topics…?

            Uuu… You’re right, if I said I’d work hard as an idol, then I have to do this…

Ah! I should go to my next meeting, I have to check up on the outfits… I’m so sorry to have made you explain so much for me.

…Um, you said I could ask you if I wanted to do anything in the event, right?

Since it’s a special event and all, could I have more time to think about that? I’ll tell you if I think up something.

            Yeah, it would be rude of me to make it so boring when they came all the way for me.

            I appreciate it, but… it’s been pretty hot lately, so please don’t overwork yourself.

            It’s horrible going through a heat stroke, y’know? Please make sure to rest well. …*Sigh*, why’d I have to be born in such a sweltering hot time…

            Thank you. I don’t think I’ll come up with something as good as you would, but… I’ll think of something.

            I wanna make everyone who wants to celebrate my birthday happy, even if only a little.

### Opening Speech

{% img /img/es/birthdaystory/es2/midori/birthdayevent.jpg %}

{% bubble Midori %}
Umm… Thank you for coming over to my birthday event, everyone.

I didn’t expect so many people to come, so… I’m pretty nervous, honestly.

I doubt I’ll be able to host this event properly… so please excuse me if my mind goes blank midway into the event.

Ahaha… Thank you for cheering me on. As a hero, I have to work hard for all the cheering I get.

I’ll be answering the questions and requests you all sent today.

I hope you can enjoy this the whole way…

### Question Segment
{% bubble Midori %}
First up is the question corner. I still don’t know what questions I’ve gotten, so I really hope it’s something I can answer…

Umm? “Midori-kun, your home is famous for being a greengrocer, so do you have any vegetables you recommend for summer?”

Hmmm… The seasonal veggies are full of nutrition, so I definitely recommend them. For summer, that’d be tomatoes, okura, and natto.

You can even grow these in your own garden, so it might be nice to try it out at home.

Next up… “Which mascot character are you crazy about the most right now?” Hmm… That’s a tricky question.

Mm… I can’t *not* say Kanatee, but the veggie mascot that shows up in commercials is super cute, too… I can’t choose one, sorry…
{% endbubble %}

### Request Segment
{% bubble Midori %}
Alright, now it’s the request corner. Thank you for all your requests, everyone.

First one is: “Please say your Ryusei Green catchphrase!”. This was the most requested one, surprisingly. Aren’t I always saying it?

…Alright then, here I go! *“The green flame is the mark of compassion! The great nature, growing infinitely! Ryusei Green, Takamine Midori!”*

Ahaha, it’s kinda embarrassing to do it without the rest here… But I hope it made you all happy.

Next is… “I want to see you do your handstand technique!”. …Wow, you know a lot about me. Did I ever talk about that being my specialty?

…Is it really that interesting to see me do a handstand?

Oh well, I’ll do it then. Here goes—

### Surprise Segment
{% bubble Midori %}
Next request is… Wait, huh? The screen went dark…

Wh—M-Morisawa-senpai? What’s going on!? Hey, wait! You're too loud and close to the screen!

Ehhh… Now people are yelling in the background that Morisawa-senpai started the video too early…

Ahh, you guys wanted to tell me happy birthday together?

I didn’t know you guys were planning that at all. So even Tetora-kun, Shinobu-kun, and Shinkai-senpai gathered together to celebrate my birthday, huh…?

You caught me by surprise, but I’m really glad to know that you wanted to do that for me.
{% endbubble %}

<img class="msr-tippy" img src="/img/es/birthdaystory/es2/midori/2021chibi_7.png" width="150" data-tippy-content="Heheh, that’s just what you’d expect from Ryuseitai.">|<img class="msr-tippy" img src="/img/es/birthdaystory/es2/midori/2021chibi_6.png" width="150" data-tippy-content="Time passed by quickly…">

### Closing Speech
{% bubble Midori %}
I almost forgot this event was gonna have to come to an end…

I was so nervous when we first started, I’m really sorry about how I acted at first. I actually wanted to leave immediately.

But now… I just wanna talk to you guys some more. That’s how much fun it was.

It’s surreal to have my birthday celebrated by people other than my family and friends… and to even have them cheer me on.

But it really, really made me feel better. Whenever I’m having a hard time at work or in my photoshoots, I’ll remember everything that happened today and keep on going.

I’m still a novice hero, but… I’ll be working hard to grow as Ryuseitai’s Ryusei Green, so please do watch over me~♪
