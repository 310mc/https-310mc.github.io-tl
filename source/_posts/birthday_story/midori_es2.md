## Party at the Agency (2020)

{% bubble Midori %}
Ahh, it's already my birthday… Time sure flies…

I've been at everyone else's birthday parties, so I was more or less prepared for this to happen, but…

It still feels kinda embarrassing. We've got Shinkai-senpai's birthday to celebrate tomorrow, so how about we call it a day instead…?

              Thank you very much. I'm sorry for being rude, especially when you took the time to prepare everything for me…

              I mean, I'm happy that I get to celebrate my birthday here, but… I feel bad that you've prepared *this* much for me…

              —No, I shouldn't think negatively about this… right? I'll be sure to enjoy the party.

              Ahaha… You saying that with a smile on your face stopped me from getting any more negative.

              Thank you so much for preparing this all for me.

              Birthdays happen only once a year, so I'll make sure to avoid saying anything negative for the day.

              Ahh, but I really need to stop moping like that… It'd be rude to everyone who came over to celebrate.

              Now that the party is here and ready for me, I'll just enjoy myself for the day.

Ah, Miss Producer. Thank you for your hard work today.

That's a large box you're holding. Would you like help carrying it?

It's full of presents for me…? I've gotten so many by now, who could they be from?

              He told me about how tasty this bakery's bread was a few days ago. I think I'll eat it with everyone now that we're all here together.

              Hehe, they all look so tasty—I dunno what to eat first.

              It says "Enjoy as a hot driNK" on the birthday card. This is just getting more cryptic…

              I'll have to thank him later. Thank you for handing it to me, Miss Producer.

Thank you for your hard work, Miss Producer.

Haah, it's finally over… It's waaay easier celebrating someone else's birthday over your own.

I'm really just not made to be the main role of anything…

              But… you're right. I have juniors now, I need to make sure to be in the spotlight more.

              I can't call myself a "main role" of anything yet… but I don't think my old self could've ever imagined me being this positive about my future.

              Tomorrow's Shinkai-senpai's birthday, so I'll help you out. I'm good at labor work, so…

              Ever since I joined the agency, I haven't been able to hang out with everyone in Ryuseitai outside of work as much.

              Tetora-kun and Shinobu-kun looked happy about it too—I'm so glad… Thank you so much for making this party for me.

## Birthday Story

### With Chiaki

{% bubble Chiaki %}
Fuhahahaha! Takamine, happy birthday!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori v2 %}
Ugh—S-Stay away from me…!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki %}
What's up, what's wrong? Why're you stepping away from me? That'll make me feel lonely, Takamine…!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori v2 %}
You hugged Tetora-kun and Shinobu-kun on their birthdays, didn't you…? I've been dreading the day you'd do the same to me…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki %}
Ohhh, I get it now! You wanted me to hug you, didn't you? I'm sorry for not noticing sooner! Well then, here I go—*squeeeze~♪*
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori v2 %}
No, I'm trying to say the opposite here—Ahhh, jeez, you're so suffocating…!
{% endbubble %}

### With Kanata

{% bubble Kanata v2 %}
midori~ happy birthday.

i brought you that thing you've wanted for so long…♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
The Kanatee plushie that was only sold on Marine Day!? It sold out five seconds after release and was gone just like that…!

C-Can I really have this for myself?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata v2 %}
yes. that's why i brought it, after all. i found the very last one of it laying deep in the storehouse. please give it lots and lots of love, okay?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
The last one…? Thank you so, so much. I'll be sure to treasure it…♪
{% endbubble %}

### With Tetora

{% bubble Tetora %}
Happy birthday, Midori-kun!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
Thank you… Isn't this rough for all of you..? I mean, Shinkai-senpai's birthday is literally the day after mine.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora %}
Huh? Why would it be? There's no way we'd have a rough time when it comes to birthday celebrations.

I'm actually happy! 'Cuz I get to tell you happy birthday from the bottom of my heart!

Keep tomorrow's plans for tomorrow, and for today, let's celebrate your birthday with all we've got~!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
"All we've got"…? Ahaha, you sure are full of energy, Tetora-kun.
{% endbubble %}

### With Shinobu

{% bubble Shinobu %}
Midori-kun, happy birthday! I'm so happy we get to celebrate your birthday together again~♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
Mhm, me too… Though I'm still not used to celebrating it outside of my family…

But I think I feel relaxed, since I know practically everyone here—Like, it doesn't feel too bad being here, I think…

Ah, that's right… The producer made the cake for me. It's got Ryuseitai's colors on it…

I can't eat it all on my own, so let's eat it with everyone.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shinobu %}
Yes, let's! I'll go prepare the plates and call everyone over!
{% endbubble %}

### With Tatsumi

{% bubble Tatsumi %}
Happy birthday, Takamine-san. May light shine upon your future. Amen. ♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
Wow… It feels really genuine when it's said in a form of a prayer.

Ah—I'm so sorry. I think I was being rude there, wasn't I…?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tatsumi %}
Oh, never. I would be rather glad to know if you felt a connection with it. Religious faith was never something to be afraid of.

We may spend time together at Gardenia, but I still don't know you particularly well yet. I hope that we will be able to deepen our bond in the future.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
Ah, yes… If you're fine with talking to me, then I'd be glad to.

### Opening Speech
{% bubble Midori %}
Umm… Thank you for coming over to my birthday event, everyone.

I didn’t expect so many people to come, so… I’m pretty nervous, honestly.

I doubt I’ll be able to host this event properly… so please excuse me if my mind goes blank midway into the event.

Ahaha… Thank you for cheering me on. As a hero, I have to work hard for all the cheering I get.

I’ll be answering the questions and requests you all sent today.

I hope you can enjoy this the whole way…

### Question Segment
{% bubble Midori %}
First up is the question corner. I still don’t know what questions I’ve gotten, so I really hope it’s something I can answer…

Umm? “Midori-kun, your home is famous for being a greengrocer, so do you have any vegetables you recommend for summer?”

Hmmm… The seasonal veggies are full of nutrition, so I definitely recommend them. For summer, that’d be tomatoes, okura, and natto.

You can even grow these in your own garden, so it might be nice to try it out at home.

Next up… “Which mascot character are you crazy about the most right now?” Hmm… That’s a tricky question.

Mm… I can’t *not* say Kanatee, but the veggie mascot that shows up in commercials is super cute, too… I can’t choose one, sorry…

### Request Segment
{% bubble Midori %}
Alright, now it’s the request corner. Thank you for all your requests, everyone.

First one is: “Please say your Ryusei Green catchphrase!”. This was the most requested one, surprisingly. Aren’t I always saying it?

…Alright then, here I go! *“The green flames are the mark of compassion! The great nature, growing infinitely! Ryusei Green, Takamine Midori!”*

Ahaha, it’s kinda embarrassing to do it without the rest here… But I hope it made you all happy.

Next is… “I want to see you do your handstand technique!”. …Wow, you know a lot about me. Did I ever talk about that being my specialty?

…Is it really that interesting to see me do a handstand?

Oh well, I’ll do it then. Here goes—

### Surprise Segment
{% bubble Midori %}
Next request is… Wait, huh? The screen went dark…

Wh—M-Morisawa-senpai? What’s going on!? Hey, wait! You're too loud and close to the screen!

Whaa… Now people are yelling in the background that Morisawa-senpai started the video too early…

Ahh, you guys wanted to tell me happy birthday together?

I didn’t know you guys were planning that at all. So even Tetora-kun, Shinobu-kun, and Shinkai-senpai gathered together to celebrate my birthday, huh…?

You caught me by surprise, but I’m really glad to know that you wanted to do that for me.

### Closing Speech
{% bubble Midori %}
I almost forgot this event was gonna have to come to an end…

I was so nervous when we first started, I’m really sorry about how I acted at first. I actually wanted to leave immediately.

But now… I just wanna talk to you guys some more. That’s how much fun it was.

It’s surreal to have my birthday celebrated by people other than my family and friends… and to even have them cheer me on.

But it really, really made me feel better. Whenever I’m having a hard time at work or in my photoshoots, I’ll remember everything that happened today and keep on going.

I’m still a novice hero, but… I’ll be working hard to grow as Ryuseitai’s Ryusei Green, so please do watch over me~♪

Ummm, thank you all for coming here today…

To be honest, I feel sorta bad to have so much prepared just for *me*… But I enjoyed everyone else's birthday parties, so…

I'd like to make sure you all enjoy mine just the same, instead of regretting coming by… so I hope you enjoy yourselves here…

<th>(…Uuu… Maybe I'm being way too self-conscious by thinking they're all here just for my sake… I'm so embarrassed…)</th>

Uuu, this is super embarrassing somehow… Never mind, I'm ending my speech here… I forgot everything I wanted to say 'cause of Morisawa-senpai.

…But… I should be grateful that there *are* people who're happy to see me grow, shouldn't I?

I'll keep working hard on improving myself, as both an ally and a rival… So I hope we can continue supporting each other.
