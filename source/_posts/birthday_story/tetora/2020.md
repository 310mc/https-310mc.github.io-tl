I'm playing Old Maid with Ryuseitai, but…

I keep losing! It's so frustrating…

Do you have any tips on how to win, Producer?

## Birthday Story

### With Chiaki

{% bubble Chiaki %}
Happy birthday, Nagumo…☆ *<th>(arms wide open)</th>*
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora v2 %}
You did the same thing on Shinobu-kun's birthday, didn'tcha…? …Ah, sure, why not.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki %}
Ohh!? I didn't expect *you* to come and hug me…!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora v2 %}
We're talkin' 'bout you, after all. You'd totally hug me even if I didn't want it.

I'd be better off just bein' a man 'bout it and go for it myself, instead of running away~
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki %}
Ohh! You really read right through me…! You've grown so much, Nagumo!
{% endbubble %}

### With Kanata

{% bubble Kanata v2 %}
tetora, happy [birthday]. let's [shake hands]~♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora v2 %}
Mm? I don't mind, but why…?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata v2 %}
last year, you said that you did not want to be [treated] as a [child], so i thought you would prefer [handshaking] over a pat on the head.

but are you perhaps in the mood to be pat on the head today?

that is fine by me~ i will pat you lots, since it is your [birthday]. good boy, good boy~…♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora v2 %}
Ahaha, that wasn't why I asked, but thank you lots anyway, Shinkai-senpai! ♪
{% endbubble %}

### With Shinobu

{% bubble Shinobu v2 %}
Happy birthday, Tetora-kun!

Please do accept my present for you~♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora v2 %}
A shuriken…? Wait— This is really heavy…!?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shinobu v2 %}
Heh, it is a weight I got just for you, Tetora-kun.

If you were to lift it like a dumbbell, you will surely build muscle~♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora v2 %}
Ohh, it has a practical use for it! I'll totally use it whenever I've got the free time~♪
{% endbubble %}

### With Midori

{% bubble Tetora v2 %}
Why're you sighing, Midori-kun?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
I wanna say "happy birthday" to Tetora-kun, but everyone keeps talking to him, so I can't find the right timing to…

I'm never gonna be able to say it before the party's over at this rate… I'm so depressed…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora v2 %}
Haha, c'mon, no way that's happening! I mean, you just said it to me right now!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
Huh? …Wait, you're right. I had my head down, so I didn't realize I was talking to you, Tetora-kun.

But I should say it while properly looking at you, so… Let me try this again: happy birthday, Tetora-kun…♪
{% endbubble %}

### With Hiiro

{% bubble Hiiro %}
Happy birthday, Buchou. You have so many of your companions here. I can tell that you're loved dearly, Buchou.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora v2 %}
Ehehe, that's too kind of ya to say~ But it really feels nice to have your birthday celebrated, huh?

Mm? Why're you starin' at me, Hiiro-kun?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Hiiro %}
Ah, I was concerned about you since our training in the gym, as you didn't seem at ease, but… I'm relieved to see that you're enjoying yourself now.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora v2 %}
Ahaha, that's 'cuz I couldn't stop thinking 'bout how there's gonna be a party after we finished, so I was a li'l nervous.

I wouldn't have been able to calm down if I was all on my own, actually. I'm real glad you were there with me, Hiiro-kun…♪
