              Thank you very much. I'm sorry for being rude, especially when you took the time to prepare everything for me…

              I mean, I'm happy that I get to celebrate my birthday here, but… I feel bad that you've prepared *this* much for me…

              —No, I shouldn't think negatively about this… right? I'll be sure to enjoy the party.

              Thank you so much for preparing this all for me.

              Birthdays happen only once a year, so I'll make sure to avoid saying anything negative for the day.

              Ahh, but I really need to stop moping like that… It'd be rude to everyone who came over to celebrate.

              Now that the party is here and ready for me, I'll just enjoy myself for the day.

## Birthday Story

### With Chiaki

{% bubble Chiaki %}
Happy birthday, Nagumo…☆ *<th>(arms wide open)</th>*
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora v2 %}
You did the same thing on Shinobu-kun's birthday, didn'tcha…? …Ah, sure, why not.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki %}
Ohh!? I didn't expect *you* to come and hug me…!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora v2 %}
We're talkin' about you, after all. You'd totally hug me even if I didn't want it.

I'd be better off just bein' a man 'bout it and go for it myself, instead of running away~
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki %}
Ohh! You really read right through me…! You've grown so much, Nagumo!
{% endbubble %}

### With Kanata

{% bubble Kanata v2 %}
tetora, happy [birthday]. let's [shake hands]~♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora v2 %}
Mm? I don't mind, but why that…?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata v2 %}
last year, you said that you did not want to be [treated] as a [child], so i thought you would prefer [handshaking] over a pat on the head.

but are you perhaps in the mood to be pat on the head today?

that is fine by me~ i will pat you lots, since it is your [birthday]. good boy, good boy~…♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora v2 %}
Ahaha, that wasn't why I asked, but thank you lots anyway, Shinkai-senpai! ♪
{% endbubble %}

### With Shinobu

{% bubble Shinobu v2 %}
Happy birthday, Tetora-kun!

Please do accept my present for you~♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora v2 %}
A shuriken…? Wait— This is really heavy…!?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shinobu v2 %}
Heh, it is a weight I got just for you, Tetora-kun.

If you were to lift it like a dumbbell, you will surely build muscle~♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora v2 %}
Ohh, it has a practical use for it! I'll totally use it whenever I've got the free time~♪
{% endbubble %}

### With Midori

{% bubble Tetora v2 %}
Why're you sighing, Midori-kun?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
I wanna say "happy birthday" to Tetora-kun, but everyone keeps talking to him, so I can't figure out the right opportunity to…

I'm never gonna be able to say it before the party's over at this rate… I'm so depressed…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora v2 %}
Haha, c'mon, no way that's happening! I mean, you just said it to me right now!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
Huh? …Wait, you're right. I had my head down, so I didn't realize I was talking to you, Tetora-kun.

But I should say it while properly looking at you, so… Let me try this again: happy birthday, Tetora-kun…♪
{% endbubble %}

### With Hiiro

{% bubble Hiiro %}
Happy birthday, Buchou. You have so many of your companions here. I can tell that you're loved dearly, Buchou.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora v2 %}
Ehehe, that's too kind of ya to say~ But it really feels nice to have your birthday celebrated, huh?

Mm? Why're you starin' at me, Hiiro-kun?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Hiiro %}
Ah, I was concerned about you since our training in the gym, as you didn't seem at ease, but… I'm relieved to see that you're enjoying yourself now.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora v2 %}
Ahaha, that's 'cuz I couldn't stop thinking about how there's gonna be a party after we finished, so I was a li'l nervous.

I wouldn't have been able to calm down if I was all on my own, actually. I'm real glad you were there with me, Hiiro-kun…♪
