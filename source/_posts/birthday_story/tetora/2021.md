Hello, Anzu-Anego, thank you for your hard work!

You've got somethin' to talk to me 'bout, right? It's kinda refreshing to get a solo job, too…

I'll do my absolute best, so! You can entrust me with anythin'!

            It's my goal to become a man among men, after all! I'll always put my all in any job!

            But I dunno if  I'll be able to do good on a job that needs thinking… If it's that sort of job, I'd like to think up plans with you!

So the job was 'bout my birthday event, huh? Shinobu-kun mentioned somethin' 'bout that, too.

Shinobu-kun'd prolly do some ninja arts in his event, right?

I'd love to do a fun event that's suitable for me, for the sake of everyone who came to see me!

            I always do hero shows with everyone in Ryuseitai, but maybe a solo show where I fight against the kaijuu would be good.

            If we're gonna do one, I'd like to be sure how big the stage will be. I wanna do some super flashy, cool action moves…☆

            I don't get a lotta opportunities to show off my karate to my fans, so that sounds nice!

Aight, we've got a good idea of what to do for the event. Thank you for taking the time out of your day for me, Anego!

That said… Birthday events have a lot more thinking to do than I thought.

They all sound like fun stuff to do, so I'm excited for the day, but… I'm a li'l worried I'll get too into it and forget what we've got planned.
{% endbubble %}

<div class="minitalk" character="Anzu">
    <div class="minitalk-option">
        <div class="minitalk-option_header">
            Would you like cue cards?
        </div>
        <div class="minitalk-option_content">
            {% bubble Tetora v2 %}
            While we could do that, I'd rather look at the audience during the event. I'll just make sure to remember everything before the day of the event!

            I wanna burn the image of everyone's fun, excited faces into my mind, after all…♪

    <div class="minitalk-option">

            You can get through it with ad-lib.

        <div class="minitalk-option_content">
            {% bubble Tetora v2 %}
            I could make things even more fun if I manage it…? So in other words, turning a predicament into an opportunity!

            I'm used to ad-lib through hero shows. If anything goes wrong, I'll manage through it so that I can heat up the crowd!

            {% bubble Tetora v2 %}
            "I think your fans would love to see that side of you, too"…? I see, you could look at it that way, huh?

            I was really caught up with making sure I don't look lame, but… I'll only go in circles if I overthink it, so I'll just go with the usual me~♪

### Opening Speech

{% img /img/es/birthdaystory/es2/tetora/birthdayevent.jpg %}

{% bubble Tetora v2 %}
Heya, everyone~! Thanks for coming to my birthday event!

I've been so excited to see you guys ever since I heard 'bout this event!

Actually, I checked the venue out from the curtains beforehand…

And I could tell how you guys were so excited to meet me just through your expressions! It made me wanna get on stage already!

But this isn't just gonna be for celebrating my birthday — I wanna make you all happy too, and have fun together! I thought up a lotta stuff for us~♪

Let's have a blast together 'til the very end~!

### Question Segment

{% bubble Tetora v2 %}
First up: the Question Segment! I'll answer all your questions. Ossu!

First question: "What's the trick to being as energetic as you, Tetora-kun?" Hm, hm~

It's gotta be sleepin' early and wakin' up early! And eating lots! I know it sounds simple, but it's real important to stay energetic. Our health comes first!

Next question: "What do you like to eat on your birthday?" Hmm… This is a tough one…!

Uu~myu, I guess it'd be any meals with meat! A first-class kalbi that was grilled through the reddest flame is just perfect. I'm droolin' just at the thought…♪

Ah! But Midori-kun pointed out that all I'd been eating is kalbi…

But let me off for my birthday at least — I'd love to eat my fav food on my birthday!
{% endbubble %}

### Request Segment

{% bubble Tetora v2 %}
Next up is the Request Segment! I'll respond to your requests with all I've got~!

This request says, "I'd love to do exercise with everyone"… Which sounds real fun, so! I'll teach you all a simple work-out exercise!

This is simple enough to do at any time, so you could try it out whenever you have the time to spare, like on the train and stuff~

Let's start by standing up. Take a huge deep breath, then let your belly go back in…

Yeah, yeah, just like that! C'mon, even if you're not used to working out, let's all build our bodies to be healthy and sound together…☆
{% endbubble %}

<img class="msr-tippy" img src="/img/es/birthdaystory/es2/tetora/2021chibi_1.png" width="150" data-tippy-content="Let's train our bodies together! ♪">|<img class="msr-tippy" img src="/img/es/birthdaystory/es2/tetora/2021chibi_6.png" width="150" data-tippy-content="How was that for an exercise?">

### Surprise Segment

{% bubble Tetora v2 %}
The lights turning off was a real surprise~… I'm glad they came back on immediately.

…Wait, huh? There's a cart outta nowhere. Wait, is this the surprise!?

I guess I should open the present box on top…? Aight, here goes…

This wrapping seems like clothes…? There's a letter with it too, who could've…

Ahh~! This is Taishou's handwriting! So this is all from Taishou…!?

Kuuh~! I'll treasure this for life! This is the best surprise I could ever have…!
{% endbubble %}

### Closing Speech

{% bubble Tetora v2 %}
…I had a blast in this event, but it looks like it's time we say our goodbyes.

Thanks a bunch for today, everyone. I had so much fun that it's bumming me out that it's all comin' to an end…

But even if it is, the fun memories will still stay within me! I'll never forget today, so please don't forget 'bout it either, everyone!

I'll work hard so we can have another celebration like this next year. 'Cuz I wanna show you all my manly, grown-up self after all my hard work.

So I hope you can keep supporting me~♪ Ossu!
