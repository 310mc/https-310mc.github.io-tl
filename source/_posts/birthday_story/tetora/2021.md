What do you typically do in a birthday event…? I'd like to know how it was for other idols, so that I may use it as reference.

Hm, hm… So fans can ask questions for the question segment… What will my fans ask me~?

And there's a request segment, too? I'd like to make sure I can meet their expectations… I wonder what they'll request from me…?

### Opening Speech

{% img /img/es/birthdaystory/es2/tetora/birthdayevent.jpg %}

{% bubble Tetora v2 %}
Heya, everyone~! Thanks for coming to my birthday event!

I've been so excited to see you guys ever since I heard about this event!

Actually, I checked the venue out from the curtains beforehand…

And I could tell how you guys were so excited to meet me just through your expressions! It made me wanna get on stage already!

But this isn't just gonna be for celebrating my birthday — I wanna make you all happy too, and have fun together! I thought up a lotta stuff for us~♪

Let's have a blast together 'til the very end~!
{% endbubble %}

### Question Segment

{% bubble Tetora v2 %}
First up: the Question Segment! I'll answer all your questions. Ossu!

First question: "What's the trick to being as energetic as you, Tetora-kun?" Hm, hm~

It's gotta be sleepin' early and wakin' up early! And eating lots! I know it sounds simple, but it's real important to stay energetic. Our health comes first!

Next question: "What do you like to eat on your birthday?" Hmm… This is a tough one…!

Uu~myu, I guess it'd be any meals with meat! A first-class kalbi that was grilled through the reddest flame is just perfect. I'm droolin' just at the thought…♪

Ah! But Midori-kun pointed out that all I'd been eating is kalbi…

But let me off for my birthday at least — I'd love to eat my fav food on my birthday!
{% endbubble %}

<img class="msr-tippy" img src="/img/es/birthdaystory/es2/tetora/2021chibi_3.png" width="150" data-tippy-content="Ooh! There's so many questions!">|<img class="msr-tippy" img src="/img/es/birthdaystory/es2/tetora/2021chibi_4.png" width="150" data-tippy-content="Early to bed and early to rise is super important! ♪">

### Request Segment

{% bubble Tetora v2 %}
Next up is the Request Segment! I'll do your requests with all I've got~!

This request says, "I'd love to do exercise with everyone"… Which sounds real fun, so! I'll teach you all a simple work-out exercise!

This is simple enough to do at any time, so you could try it out whenever you have time to spare, like on the train and stuff~

Let's start by standing up. Take a huge deep breath, then let your belly go back in…

Yeah, yeah, just like that! C'mon, even if you're not used to working out, let's all build our bodies to be healthy and sound together…☆
{% endbubble %}

<img class="msr-tippy" img src="/img/es/birthdaystory/es2/tetora/2021chibi_5.png" width="150" data-tippy-content="Let's train our bodies together! ♪">|<img class="msr-tippy" img src="/img/es/birthdaystory/es2/tetora/2021chibi_6.png" width="150" data-tippy-content="How was that for an exercise?">

### Surprise Segment

{% bubble Tetora v2 %}
The lights turning off was a real surprise~… I'm glad they came back on immediately.

…Wait, huh? There's a wagon outta nowhere. Wait, is this the surprise!?

I guess I should open the present box on top… Aight, here goes…

This wrapping seems like clothes…? There's a letter with it too, who could've…

Ahh~! This is Taishou's handwriting! So this is all from Taishou…!?

Kuuh~! I'll treasure this for life! This is the best surprise I could ever have…!
{% endbubble %}

<img class="msr-tippy" img src="/img/es/birthdaystory/es2/tetora/2021chibi_7.png" width="150" data-tippy-content="Nothing could express how moved I am…!">|<img class="msr-tippy" img src="/img/es/birthdaystory/es2/tetora/2021chibi_8.png" width="150" data-tippy-content="It's such a shame that it's all comin' to an end…!">

### Closing Speech

{% bubble Tetora v2 %}
…I had a blast in this event, but it looks like it's time we say our goodbyes.

Thanks a bunch for today, everyone. I had so much fun that it's bumming me out that it's all comin' to an end…

But even if it is, the fun memories will still stay within me! I'll never forget today, so please don't forget about it either, everyone!

I'll work hard so we can have another celebration like this next year. 'Cuz I wanna show you all my manly, grown-up self after all my hard work.

So I hope you can keep supporting me~♪ Ossu!
