You are impeccable as always, Anzu-dono! You prepared such a grand party in such a short amount of time…!

Your dexterity shows you, too, have what it takes to be a ninja—

Mm? What do you have in your hand?

            Ah, this is a teddy bear. Heheheh, how adorable, it's holding a cookie! ♪

            Ohh, I can attach it to my clothes through this pin… Thank you for the lovely present, Anzu-dono!

            I see, so a teddy bear that has my name on it… How elaborate! This acts as proof that I am the main lead of this party, correct?

            Very well then, I'll clip it on… What do you think? Does it suit me?

It is difficult to choose from such a tasty assortment of food! ♪

Mm, perhaps I should start with salad, as a starter… Ah, but the food over there looks tasty too, and I'm curious about the drinks~…

Anzu-dono, what will you have first?

            You even prepared hyorogan food!? Mmm, it's true that I cannot ignore such food as a ninja, but… It will make me full…

            I can take it with me? Very well then, I shall take it with me as a souvenir~♪

            Hmhm, we *are* having a feast after all, one must start with a cheers! You're correct as always, Anzu-dono.

            You prepared an umeboshi drink for me? Ah, I have to drink that, it's my favorite! Right then… Cheers~♪

Ah—! It's already this late… Unfortunately, we must call it an end here.

Once I head back to my room, I plan to sleep after I take a good look at all the presents people brought me.

Anzu-dono, thank you very much for preparing this birthday party for me~♪

            Of course! The proof of that is my smile all throughout the party!

            Hmm… Well, I feel as though we would have a lot of fun if everyone could be ninjas together, and show off our ninja art… However, I don't particularly have anything I want either way.

            I'm happy enough just knowing people want to celebrate my birthday~♪

### Presents from ES Idols

{% bubble Tetora v2 %}
This present is… Wha—!? It's the work-out gear I wanted!!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble HiMERU %}
Happy birthday, Nagumo. Did you like HiMERU's present?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora v2 %}
This is from you, HiMERU-san!? Thank you so much! ☆ But how'd you know I wanted this?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble HiMERU %}
Fufu, it was a simple deduction. HiMERU noticed that you threw away your broken work-out equipment, and heard witness reports that you've been looking over options for the same equipment.

Which can only mean one thing: You found something to replace your broken equipment, but you had still been hesitating whether to buy it.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora v2 %}
Wooahh, you're amazing, HiMERU-san! That's incredible deduction skills! I'll make sure to repay you on your birthday!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble HiMERU %}
Fufufu, HiMERU finds your earnest nature quite favorable. HiMERU is excited for that day. ♪
{% endbubble %}
