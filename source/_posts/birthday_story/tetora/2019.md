## Birthday Story

### Chiaki

{% bubble Chiaki %}
Uu… Uuu… You've grown so much, Nagumo! I'm so emotional…!

Ah, um, I know you're still growing. But I got hit with emotion when I imagined how much more you're going to grow!

I see it before my eyes! Your figure in the future…! You're shining bright and looking reliable alongside Sengoku and Takamine…☆

Oh! Don't turn away with a stunned look!

Hahaha! ♪ I won't let you get away~

Happy birthday, Nagumo! Let me hug you lots as celebration! Squeeze squeeze~☆
{% endbubble %}

### Midori

{% bubble Midori %}
Happy birthday, Nagumo-kun.

Did you like the Kalbidon cushion I gave you…?

It's like this kalbi beef bowl mascot was made just for you…

I'm glad I found it, 'cause it made it easy to choose a present for you… Hm? It's nice for hugging?

Mhm, isn't it, isn't it? And the soft-like feel to its face, and how you can't tell which part of it is meant to be like a kalbi bowl is amazing…☆

Heheheh, I'd be so happy if this cushion gets you more into mascot characters…♪
{% endbubble %}

### Shinobu

{% bubble Shinobu v2 %}
Tetora-kuuun! Happy birthday~♪

You celebrated my birthday the other day, remember? I have been so excited for this day ever since!

I was so, so happy when everyone celebrated my birthday…

So I wanted to, um… celebrate m-my precious comrade's birthday too…

I was worried getting too into it would not work out well, but… Did it make you happy?

Ehehe, that is wonderful news. I hope we continue to get along with each other, Tetora-kun…♪
{% endbubble %}

### Kanata

{% bubble Kanata v2 %}
happy [birthday], tetora. good boy, good boy…♪

oh? do you not [like] people patting your head?

ah, so you do not like being [treated] like a [child]. you have become an [adult] now, even though you are still just a [child], fufufu…♪

i am not making [fun] of you~ i think it is just fine that you are like that, it is just like [you].

ufufu, you did not like me [treating] you like a [child] when you have grown a year older, yes?

then let's [shake hands] instead. let's keep getting along, okay~…♪
{% endbubble %}

### Kuro

{% bubble Kuro %}
Yo, Tetsu. I see you're havin' a great time.

Li'l Lady told me that they'll hold a birthday party for you, and I was gonna come over to it like everyone else, but then Morisawa told me to wait 'til he gives me the signal, so…

I guess they made me join the party in a really flashy way, but… was it really alright for someone like me to be the surprise guest?

Ohh? So you were okay with it, huh… Aight, I won't say anythin' else if you're that sure 'bout it.

Haha, as long as you're happy, Tetsu. Happy birthday…♪
{% endbubble %}

### Tomoya

{% bubble Tomoya %}
Tetora, happy birthday~♪

It's pretty festive here with your seniors around. I'm really glad I got to come to a party this lively.

I should've given it to you earlier, since I bet you have a ton of them by now, but…

Um, Hajime and I also got you a present. Could you take it?

Yep, it's a bento box. You looked like the type with a big appetite, so we thought you may need a bigger one.

Tell the senior who makes bentos for you to make your portions bigger, too~♪
{% endbubble %}

### Hajime

{% bubble Hajime %}
Happy birthday, Tetora-kun. I'm so, so happy I got to celebrate a friend's birthday like this~♪

Wawa, please don't bow your head down~! I-I want to thank you for everything, too!

…Heheh~♪ That's right, both you and I speak politely, don't we?

I feel more relaxed speaking politely, but what about you, Tetora-kun?

Hehe, I thought so. I think you're fine just like that…♪

Talking like this doesn't mean we're trying to be distant, after all. Let's keep getting along, please~♪
{% endbubble %}

### Hinata

{% bubble Hinata %}
Hyahoo~! ☆ Happy birthday, Tetsu-kun!

Ahaha, whoops, I jumped on you hard! Hmm? I'm too excited?

Of course I am, it's your birthday! Tetsu-kun's mooom\~ Thanks for giving birth to Tetsu-kun\~☆

Let's hype things up even more! How about a match between us two?

If we have one with a game you might end up losing hardcore and being sad on your birthday, so we could have one with our fists for today!

Heh heh heh… You gotta beat me first if you wanna be a man among men…… Just kidding~♪
