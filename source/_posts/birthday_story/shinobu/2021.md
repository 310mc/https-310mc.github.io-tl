            Huh!? A birthday event for me? I did hear about Tetora-kun and Shinobu-kun doing that, but one for *me* as well…?

{% bubble Shinobu v2 %}
Shutatatata… Whoosh!

Sengoku Shinobu, whose birthday is today, has made his arrival to his birthday event~! ♪

…Wawa—! I thank you all for the birthday celebrations as soon as I made my appearance~!

Just knowing everyone here has come just to celebrate my birthday makes me overjoyed with gratitude~! ♪

However, I am not the type of ninja to simply take without giving. I am a ninja and an idol…!

Therefore, I shall make sure to bring happiness to all of you, the same way as you did to me! Nihihi, I hope you all enjoy this event!

### Question Segment

{% bubble Shinobu v2 %}
Let's start with the Question Segment! Thank you very much for all your questions~!

While a ninja is meant to conceal themselves, I personally would like all of you to learn more about my way of life, so I shall answer as many questions as I can~♪

"What sort of cake do you like?" …Hm, hm! What a perfect question for birthdays~

I am happy to announce that I was gifted a cake in the shape of a shuriken! ♪ Despite it's small size, it is shaped intricately to look exactly like one, and it was extremely delicious, too!

Next question: "What do you do on the weekends?" Hm… Well, I of course sometimes have idol work on the weekends, but…

I went out with my friend Yuuta-kun a few weekends ago! ♪ We had a lot of fun playing in the park~♪

### Request Segment

{% bubble Shinobu v2 %}
Now then, off to the Request Segment! Thank you for all your requests!

I have prepared myself to take on any request for the sake of entertainment, but…

I am pleased to say that most of the requests asked to see a ninja art from me! I hope this means many of you are interested in ninjas…♪

Right then, let us begin…! I will rush close to all of you through the Ninja Art: Swift Approach Jutsu! Woosh!

Heh~♪ Are you all surprised? I wanted to step down to your seats so that I may see all of you clearly, and finally had the opportunity to do so!

Everyone looks happy despite their surprise…! Nihihi, your expressions are enough for me…! ♪

### Surprise Segment

{% bubble Shinobu v2 %}
Now then, the next segment is… Mm? A staff member has brought over something for me…?

It's a scroll! Wait, could there be… writing in this…?

What!? Did the audience write all of this!? There are so many messages…!

Ah! Even my members from Ryuseitai wrote messages for me! This is Tetora-kun's handwriting, and this is Midori-kun's…♪

"Let's always be friends, okay?", "We're always gonna be with ya!" …Uuu~! Thank you so much…!

How could I *not* be happy with such a wonderful gift!? I wll cherish everyone's feelings deep in my heart!

### Closing Speech

{% bubble Shinobu v2 %}
Ah—! We're already nearing the end…!? But I wanted to be with everyone for a bit longer~!

However, the reason I feel that way is because today was a lot of fun…!

Your questions, your requests, your surprise…! Everything made me so, so happy!

I feel as though I was the one who enjoyed this the most, though… Have I all brought happiness to you all as well, just as I said would?

…Mhm, ehehe! I'm so happy to see everyone's smiles. Your smiles are the best gift in the world! ♪

I shall continue to pursue my idol path as a hero-ninja forevermore…♪
