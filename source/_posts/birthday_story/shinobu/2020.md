              Thank you very much. I'm sorry for being rude, especially when you took the time to prepare everything for me…

              I mean, I'm happy that I get to celebrate my birthday here, but… I feel bad that you've prepared *this* much for me…

              —No, I shouldn't think negatively about this… right? I'll be sure to enjoy the party.

              Thank you so much for preparing this all for me.

              Birthdays happen only once a year, so I'll make sure to avoid saying anything negative for the day.

              Ahh, but I really need to stop moping like that… It'd be rude to everyone who came over to celebrate.

              Now that the party is here and ready for me, I'll just enjoy myself for the day.
