Producer-dono, I'm sorry to have kept you waiting~♪

Ah—! There are so many tasty food here!

I made sure to come with an empty stomach for my party, so I'm excited to dig in~

              Mm, I will hold off on eating anything for now.

              You prepared so much for me, did you not? So I will wait until the party starts.

              I appreciate the sentiment! Thank you, Producer-dono.

              There are some small cream puffs as spare, so I can eat those?

              Very well, if you say so…

              <th><em>(chew, chew)</em></th>… Mm, it's sweet! It's so tasty and creamy~♪

              Don't worry! I won't touch any of it yet.

              However, I feel even hungrier from the tasty smell…

              I shall train myself a little by running up and down the stairs, so that I avoid nibbling on the food!

              I'm aware! I'll be sure to wait!

{% bubble Shinobu v2 %}
Producer-dono! There's something I'd like to ask you!

This small cake is in the shape of a shuriken, correct?

Ah, you prepared it just for me? I'm so touched~♪

              What!? It's made in the shape of a *real* shuriken!? Does that mean you can make one in the shape of an octagonal shuriken!?

              Hm, I see… There are far too many sharp edges, so it will be difficult to cut it cleanly to be that shape…

              That is a bit of a shame, but there's nothing we can do about it.

              Mayoi-dono was the one to suggest it…? As expected from a member of the Ninja Association, he truly understands whats best~! ♪

              I would like to eat the cake with Mayoi-dono, as fellow ninja lovers. I will go ask him right away!
