"Our time together may have been short, but I thank you all for listening to this broadcast! Right then— This was the guest, Sengoku Shinobu, speaking!"

Ah— Anzu-dono! Excellent work today!

The radio broadcast just finished now! I accomplished my duty as a special birthday guest, you see~♪

            The truth is… When I was first offered this opportunity, I was not sure if I could manage through the radio.

            However, I was thankfully worried over nothing! Once it started, I found myself having endless topics to talk about, and had a very wonderful time during the recording~♪

            Thank you~♪ Ehehe, the letters I got to read today had so many "happy birthday" messages for me!

I could even give a gold star for this radio, honestly! ♪

While I am typically the shy type of ninja, I was able to utilize my experience in the Broadcasting Committee!

Oh yes, why are you here, Anzu-dono?

It's about time I left the studio.

A special birthday show… This project was truly wonderful~♪ I feel as though I was able to convey my feelings to all my fans.

Do you plan to do more of those birthday projects…?

            I see… That's true, it is difficult to make sure everyone's schedules align on the day of their birthday.

            However, if there ever is a radio scheduled for someone's birthday, I will be there to listen to it! ♪

### Birthday Night, Part One

#### <div mt="rare"></div> 1/3

{% img /img/es/birthdaystory/es2/shinobu/birthdaynight1_1.jpg %}

{% bubble Shinobu v2 %}
Shutatata…☆ Sengoku Shinobu has made his arrival!

Oh…? Anzu-dono isn't here yet…

Very well, I shall use my Camouflage Jutsu and hide on this wall—
{% endbubble %}

<div class="msr-narration">
    <p>Huh? Is he still not here…?</p>
</div>

{% bubble Shinobu v2 %}
Nin-nin! ♪ Anzu-dono, I'm over here! My Camouflage Jutsu was a huge success!

Heheh! Don't you think I've improved since the past? I wanted to show off my improved jutsu while I had the opportunity~♪
{% endbubble %}

#### <div mt="rare"></div> 2/3

{% bubble Shinobu v2 %}
Whew, there was a lot to do today, from my birthday party to the radio recording…

I was running in and out of the ES building the whole day.

I feel like I can finally take a breather…♪
{% endbubble %}

<div class="msr-narration">
    <p>Are you tired?</p>
</div>

{% bubble Shinobu v2 %}
Nay, I'm not the slightest bit tired!

Just the sight of all my birthday cards and presents from everyone fills me to the brim with endless energy! ♪
{% endbubble %}

#### <div mt="rare"></div> 3/3

{% bubble Shinobu v2 %}
There are many kinds of birthday cards lately, it seems.

For example, I received a birthday card with a frog design from a fan!

Look, this one. The envelope and cover have so many frogs on it~♪
{% endbubble %}

<div class="msr-narration">
    <p>It's cute.</p>
</div>

{% bubble Shinobu v2 %}
This one on the edge looks similar to Momocchi, and this one on the leaf looks like Thunder! ♪

To think they found this card just for me… I'm truly happy~♪
{% endbubble %}

### Birthday Night, Part Two

#### <div mt="rare"></div> 1/3

{% bubble Shinobu v2 %}
Hmhm, so you called me here so that you may give me a birthday present?

Ohh, it is concealed in such a cute wrapping!

I wonder what's inside…? Can I open it right now?
{% endbubble %}

<div class="msr-narration">
    <p>Yeah, you can.</p>
</div>

{% bubble Shinobu v2 %}
Right then, if you'll excuse me…

Wahh, what a pretty brooch! Did you prepare this for me!? Thank you very much, Anzu-dono!
{% endbubble %}

#### <div mt="rare"></div> 2/3

{% img /img/es/birthdaystory/es2/shinobu/birthdaynight2_1.jpg %}

{% bubble Shinobu v2 %}
Heh, I'm so happy, I could not help myself from clipping it on straight away~♪

You've given me such a lovely present, so I'd like to repay you somehow.

You are free to ask anything from me, Anzu-dono~♪
{% endbubble %}

<div class="msr-narration">
    <p>Umm…</p>
</div>

{% bubble Shinobu v2 %}
Mmm, you cannot think of anything? Or are you perhaps just holding yourself back…?

Alright, then on your birthday, I will make sure to gift you something just as wonderful as this brooch, Anzu-dono! ♪
{% endbubble %}

#### <div mt="rare"></div> 3/3

{% bubble Shinobu v2 %}
Today was truly a fulfilling day.

A birthday party just for me, presents just for me…

I had a wonderful time. I made such wonderful memories today…♪

    <p>I'm so glad.</p>
</div>

{% bubble Shinobu v2 %}
Of course, I'm also happy that I was able to talk to you at our leisure before the day ended! ♪

I will continue to work my hardest this year, so please do watch over me, Anzu-dono!
