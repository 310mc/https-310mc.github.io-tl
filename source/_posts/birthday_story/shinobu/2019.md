## Birthday Story

### Chiaki

{% bubble Chiaki %}
Sengokuuuuuuu!! Happy birthdaaaaaaaay!!

Ha ha ha!! ☆ Was I too loud? My bad, my bad! Forgive me!

This is the happiest day of the year for you. I had to show my feelings somehow.

Hm? You understand how I feel pretty well by now, so I should relax?

I see, I see! Thank you, Sengoku! Happy birthday, Sengoku!

I'll keep saying it some more! Happy birthday, Sengoku! No, it's still not enough! Let me hug you as well…☆
{% endbubble %}

### Midori

{% bubble Midori %}
Hey, Sengoku-kun… Um, could you please stop crying…?

Ah, yeah… I know you're not crying 'cause you're sad…

But I'm not sure what to do when I see someone crying, so, like…… Uuu, now I feel like crying…

Ah no, um, you don't have to force yourself to smile, either… <em>Sigh</em>, this is tough…

Ahh, that's right, I didn't properly say it to you yet…

Happy birthday, Sengoku-kun. Keep being the same you…♪
{% endbubble %}

### Tetora

{% bubble Tetora %}
Sengoku-kun! I'm real sorry for freaking you out earlier!

I mean, of *course* you'd be surprised if you were being kidnapped all'a sudden… But see, Midori-kun and I were trying our hardest to make sure you don't find out 'bout the surprise…

And we could've spilled the beans if we spoke a single word, so we kept our mouths shut the whole time. That was way harder to accomplish than expected, though…

'Cuz like, you kept begging for help and apologizing over and over… We felt really bad for doing that to you…

I know this is dumb to say after everythin' we did to you today, but please trust us a li'l more. You're our comrade, after all.

Yep, our *comrade!* ♪ I'm so glad we got to celebrate your birthday! So once again, happy birthday, Sengoku-kun!
{% endbubble %}

### Kanata

{% bubble Kanata v2 %}
shinobu~ happy [birthday]…♪

i missed my chance to give you your [present], so could you take it now?

it is a [dvd] about [octopuses]. yes, it is a [special] video that showcases [octopuses] the whooole time~♪

[octopuses] are said to be the [ninjas] of the [ocean], you see. i am sure this [dvd] will come in [handy] to you.

ehehe, we had fun being [ninjas] together today, didn't we? ♪

let's do it again some other time. yes, i [promise] you we will~♪
{% endbubble %}

### Mao

{% bubble Mao %}
Sengoku, happy birthday~♪

The party was fun. I'm really thankful I got to join in, as well.

Hmm? You wanted me to celebrate your birthday, so you're really happy I came?

Huh, that's great then. You're always helping me out, so if there's anything else I could do for you, just tell me.

…You want me to pat your head? You sure? You seemed the type who didn't like that…

But well, if that's what you want. There, there, <em><th>(pat, pat)</th></em>… Let's keep getting along with each other~♪
{% endbubble %}

### Souma

{% bubble Souma %}
Sengoku. …Is Sengoku here?

Haha, there you are. You truly are a ninja — You are getting a lot better at hiding your presence.

Hm? You like what I said just now? It sounded like you are serving a lord…?

I see, you sound excited after having fun being a ninja with everyone in the party, do you not?

Good, very good. It is your birthday, after all. Be it ninja or lord, I will become anything for you today.

Happy birthday, Sengoku! Ahh, what a blissful day! Wonderful, simply wonderful…♪
{% endbubble %}

### Nazuna

{% bubble Nazuna %}
Happy birthday, Shinobun. I'm so glad I got to celebrate your birthday~♪

You're aaalways talking about how shy you are, so I was really worried for you…

But I was relieved to see this many people rushing to say happy birthday to you… I even talked about it with Mako-chin.

Of course, if you've ever got a problem, you can always rely on your seniors in the Broadcast Committee, 'kay~?

I hope we get to make some great memories in the committee. Like celebrating each other's birthdays, or going out together somewhere~♪

Ahaha, if you're happy, then so am I. Happy birthday! ☆
{% endbubble %}

### Yuuta

{% bubble Yuta %}
Shinobu-kun! Happy birthday, nin nin…♪

Ahaha, woops, I copied you. I just wanted to try saying it once.

I mean, you always look so happy whenever you're talking about ninjas, y'know?

Talk to me about all kinds of things, okay? I want to know more about what my friends like, and it's good to know for presents.

Hm? Yeah, I did say “friend” right now.

Of *course* it's about you, Shinobu-kun! You're a precious friend to me, so let's keep getting along with each other~♪
