{% bubble Mitsuru curious %}
Ah, Ne~chan. You've got work this late at night?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mitsuru norsmile %}
I was just about to head home. It got late by the time I finished practicing…

Thinking about tomorrow makes me kinda restless. I can't get myself to stay still.

            {% bubble Mitsuru smilesoft %}
            Mhm. I'm half-excited, half-nervous…!

            I got called by Ni~chan earlier to have a strategy meeting, and in the end I decided the only choice I have is to do my best in my own way.

            I just gotta challenge myself as a member of Ra*bits!

            Yup, the audition's gonna start!

            Just thinking about that makes me wanna run out immediately…! But I'll keep that feeling for tomorrow.
            {% endbubble %}
            {% bubble Mitsuru grin %}
            That's why I gotta eat dinner early and sleep as much as possible!

{% bubble Mitsuru curious %}
Ne~chan, what sorta work were you doing?

…It's a secret? Ah, is it like, the "must remain confidential" kind?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mitsuru sighfrown %}
I also get a lotta things at work that I have to keep a secret. I can't even tell my family, so it kinda makes me restless.

            {% bubble Mitsuru smile %}
            Mhm! It's a crucial promise to make when having a job!

            If info leaked to the public before the announcement, everyone would just feel let down after all the preparation they've done.

            The same can be said about our fans, too. So I'll keep my mouth zipped at all times~♪

            They know I'm participating in the audition! I've also done loads of filming, and they saw that too~♪

            I got a lot of support from everyone at school too, so I wanna do my best.
            {% endbubble %}
            {% bubble Mitsuru fist %}
            And also, I want to be thought of as an amazing senior by my juniors…☆

{% bubble Mitsuru smileconfident %}
Heave-ho. Okay, I'll have to go now, but do you still have work at ES, Ne~chan?

—This was the last of it? That's great to hear!

Then let's go home together, Ne\~chan\~♪

            {% bubble Mitsuru grin %}
            Nope, I was practicing, so not yet~… I was thinking of stopping by a convenience store before going home.

            If I buy onigiri at the convenience store now, I'll get a yuruchara sticker, the thing Midori-chan loves most~♪

            He said he wanted to collect them all, so I'm helping him out.

            You're feeling hungry too, Ne~chan? I was thinking of eating something before heading home, too.

            I think Shiina-senpai might still be at Cinnamon at this hour?

            Let's drop by the cafe together~♪ I'm sure he'd make us some real good food!
