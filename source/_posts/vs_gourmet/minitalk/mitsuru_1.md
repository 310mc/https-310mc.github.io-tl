{% bubble Mitsuru curious %}
Ne~chan, should I put this box here?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mitsuru smilesoft %}
Whew. You were gonna try carrying a box this heavy all on your own first… Ne~chan, don't overdo it so much, okay?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mitsuru fist %}
I'm a third year by now! So I want you to rely on me more~♪

            Hehe! I've been working out lots lately~♪

            So you can leave any heavy stuff to me! I can just consider it as a workout!

            If there's anything else you need help with, you can let me know anytime! ☆

            Heh. I gained quite a bit of muscle lately. Look, you can get a feel of my biceps!

            Don'tcha think that I've built some muscle? I'll keep at it with my workout training!

{% bubble Mitsuru curious %}
So about this box… It was super heavy, what's even in it?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mitsuru shocked %}
"Fake food"…? Since it's food, is it edible?

Show me an example, Ne~chan!
{% endbubble %}

        <div class="minitalk-option_header">
            It's something like this.

            {% bubble Mitsuru smilesoft %}
            Ah, it's the stuff you see in restaurants! I've seen it before too!

            Woah~ It's almost like the real thing! How do they make these?

            This Napotilan pasta even has a fork on it!

            {% bubble Mitsuru smile %}
            Ah, this is that "food sample" thing! I've seen them before!

            It's used in magazine photoshoots? That makes sense, 'cuz you'd just feel hungry if you used real food.
            {% endbubble %}
            {% bubble Mitsuru curious %}
            Huh? It's to preserve it at a good-looking state? I never considered that!

{% bubble Mitsuru nod %}
Look, look, they even have sample of bread~♪

It looks so fluffy, but it's rock hard…! It's kind of a weird feeling!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mitsuru smileconfident %}
Looking at this makes me crave bread. Ne~chan, how about we go to a bakery together?
{% endbubble %}

            I'll guide you, so you can just follow me, Ne~chan! I'll show you to a bakery I recommend!

            Ahaha, I'm so excited\~♪ Bread, bread, breaaad\~♪

            {% bubble Mitsuru smileexplain %}
            How about the bakery in the neighboring town? I heard on TV that the <em>shio pan</em> bread there is "one-of-a-kind"!

            It's a little far from here, but you've got some time, right?
            {% endbubble %}
