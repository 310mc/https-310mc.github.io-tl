Oh! Anzu. What’s up, do you have something to do at the agency?

—It’s with me? Wait, what you’re holding…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki smilesoft %}
Ooh, it’s my profile sheet for the audition…! I’ve been waiting for this!

            Huh? You knew about it?

            {% bubble Chiaki smile %}
            Yeah, I actually saw Akehoshi fill in his sheet at the agency desk, so…

            I just knew it meant I’d have to fill in my own. It’s hard to decide what to write!

            Let’s see… I have to write my name first, huh? They say a person’s handwriting shows who they are inside, so I’ll be sure to fill it in properly~♪

            Fufu, I met Isara at the corridors, and he told me that we have to write a self-PR for the audition.

            I was waiting impatiently for the request to come to me next. Right, time to think about what I’ll write…

            If I recall correctly, we have to choose a photo too, right? I can’t decide which to go with at all…♪

{% bubble Chiaki srsthinking %}
Mm~… What’s this “my hashtag” part?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki curious %}
…“What sort of tags would you use on yourself”? Hm. Hero is a given for me, but I’d like to go with something more intricate.

A hashtag that expresses who I am… What do you think that would be, Anzu?

            Hm, I thought for sure you’d have a great idea in mind, though…

            {% bubble Chiaki smile %}
            But this is a project specifically to convey who I am to the fans directly, so I should give it a proper thought and decide under my own will.

            I’ll keep thinking about it a little more! Look forward to seeing my answers~♪

            {% bubble Chiaki smilesoft %}
            Haha, it’s hard to think up anything when you’re suddenly asked, right? I feel the same!

            I’ll ask the other participants what they wrote for theirs later.

            Who knows, I might be able to use it as reference!

{% bubble Chiaki smileconfident %}
…Alright. Not including the parts I want to think about thoroughly, I’ve filled in most of the areas.

Although, I feel a little embarrassed knowing a handwritten message will be shown to the public…

But I hope all my fans will be happy to see it. I can’t wait for when they publicize the sheets…♪

<div class="minitalk" character="Anzu">
    <div class="minitalk-option">
        <div class="minitalk-option_header">
          Yes, definitely.

            There’s still a few days left until the audition, so I’ll have to make sure I’m fully prepared until then.

            I don’t know what awaits us over there, but…
            {% endbubble %}
            {% bubble Chiaki fist %}
            For the sake of my comrades and my fans supporting me, I just have to do everything within my power to the best of my capabilities!

            {% bubble Chiaki smileexplain %}
            Ah, yeah! You’ll compile all of the sheets from the agency and send it to the audition’s management team, right?

            I’ll give the rest of the questions a proper thought until the deadline.

            I assure you I won’t forget to submit it, so you can rest at ease there~♪
