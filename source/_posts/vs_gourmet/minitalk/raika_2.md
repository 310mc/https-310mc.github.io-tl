{% bubble Raika curious %}
Umm, Anzu-oneesan. You look sad; what’s wrong…?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Raika surprised %}
…It’s about the food I made!? Ehhh, is there some problem with it…!?

I tried to make it as best as I could, while rememberin’ all the food I’ve eaten so far…
{% endbubble %}

<div class="minitalk" character="Anzu">
    <div class="minitalk-option">

            How did you make it?

        <div class="minitalk-option_content">
            {% bubble Raika norsmile %}
            So I added rice to the pot, then poured a lot of tap water…

            Then I boiled it well until the rice turned to a mush. The more water ya add, the more portion it’s got, so… And then, um, erm…
            {% endbubble %}
            {% bubble Raika northinking %}
            Seasoning? But I believe the taste of the rice will be slightly enjoyable to eat as is…?

            {% bubble Raika smileconfident %}
            Ehihi, I grinded and mixed my favorite foods~♪

            There were a lot of vegetables, so I went with onions and spinach… I put ingredients that are nutritional in the grindin’ bowl.

            I only used one type of vegetable for the one I ate before, so this one should definitely be much tastier…♪

{% bubble Raika awkward %}
That all bein’ said… The "scramble for ingredients" had a lot of pressure in it, didn’t it…

All the idols were so eager… I truly felt the pressure.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Raika norsmile %}
If Ritsu-sama hadn’t held my hand… I would’ve definitely been sucked into the crowd.
{% endbubble %}

<div class="minitalk" character="Anzu">
    <div class="minitalk-option">
        <div class="minitalk-option_header">
            So you got help, huh?
        </div>
        <div class="minitalk-option_content">
            {% bubble Raika grin %}
            Ehihi. Ritsu-sama’s such a kind person…♪

            It’s not just him, everyone I met today… They were all so kind to me to such an incredible level.

            That’s why I’ll try to find somethin’ I can do for everyone’s sake, as well. It’s an idol’s duty to take action for the sake of others, correct?

    <div class="minitalk-option">

            It must’ve been rough.
        </div>
        <div class="minitalk-option_content">
            {% bubble Raika smilesoft %}
            Thanks to that, I was also able to obtain ingredients…♪

            Ritsu-sama bought so many ingredients I’ve never seen before! It was stuff I couldn’t figure out how you’d even use.

            I also want to try Ritsu-sama’s food…♪

{% bubble Raika norsmile %}
Onee-san, are ya goin’ to other restaurants after this?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Raika nod %}
You’re not sure where to go next? I know how ya feel…!

There were so many tasty-lookin’ meals in the kitchen, and I can smell all kinds of different food even when queuin’ up…♪
{% endbubble %}

<div class="minitalk" character="Anzu">
    <div class="minitalk-option">

          Good luck after this, too.

            {% bubble Raika fist %}
            Yes! I’ll do my best!

            …Um, Onee-san. You don’t seem to have finished the food; are you sure you want me to take away the plate?
            {% endbubble %}
            {% bubble Raika surprised %}
            …You have a stomachache? Uhee, please get well soon!

            {% bubble Raika smilesoft %}
            If I have time as well, I’d love to try out all the food here~♪

            But, but! Managin’ my restaurant comes first, correct?
            {% endbubble %}
            {% bubble Raika fist %}
            I feel like I could lose to the tasty smell any moment, but… I’ll be sure to get through the first day!
