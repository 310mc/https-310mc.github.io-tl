{% bubble Hiyori curious %}
Hey, Anzu-chan. Have we still not arrived at our job location?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Hiyori yare %}
While I’m aware there’s nothing we could do about me attending much later than the rest, I’ve grown quite fed up of this silence!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Hiyori smilesoft %}
Don’t you have any interesting stories to share? For my sake, since I’m so bored…♪

            You can’t think of anything? Ehh~ Do you truly have nothing?
            {% endbubble %}
            {% bubble Hiyori norsmile %}
            It can be about what’s been happening lately, or something that made you happy… Anything, really.

            Even if it wasn’t that interesting, it could still act as a way to kill time, no?

            Gosh, I can’t believe that you’ve got nothing!

            —A topic from me? Hm, I can’t decide what to start with, but…
            {% endbubble %}
            {% bubble Hiyori srsthinking %}
            …I almost thought of one that might be interesting, but on second thought, maybe not.

{% bubble Hiyori norsmile %}
So, today’s work is exploring a harbor city, yes?

The other Eden members are having a meal in the cafeteria around this hour, and I’ll be joining them afterwards…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Hiyori northinking %}
Although, I think I’ll be able to meet up with them at the cafeteria if we keep up this pace…?

            That’s true…

            {% bubble Hiyori grin %}
            My previous job finished much earlier than planned, so we’re moving along much faster than I thought we would.

            And luckily, the roads look to be empty, too…♪
            {% endbubble %}
            {% bubble Hiyori smilesoft %}
            Wouldn’t it be a nice idea to surprise them with our arrival? They’ll surely love it!

            We can’t be too sure, can we?

            {% bubble Hiyori norsmile2 %}
            I think we’ll be able to arrive there earlier than planned, but… Well, there could be traffic ahead of us, too.

            Plan A will be moving according to plan, but for plan B, I’ll prepare a surprise on how I’ll join them after they leave the cafeteria!
            {% endbubble %}
            {% bubble Hiyori nod %}
            Not only will Eden members love it, but so will our viewers; I’m sure of it! That would be the finest weather…♪

{% bubble Hiyori norsmile2 %}
Ah, I almost forgot that I had something to give you, Anzu-chan.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Hiyori smileexplain %}
Here you go; I kindly bought you something to drink when we stopped at a rest area a while earler.

You haven’t had anything to drink, correct? You shouldn’t forget to hydrate yourself, you know.
{% endbubble %}

<div class="minitalk" character="Anzu">
    <div class="minitalk-option">
        <div class="minitalk-option_header">
            Thank you very much…!

        <div class="minitalk-option_content">
            {% bubble Hiyori norsmile %}
            I was also feeling thirsty, so I figured I could buy you one too while I’m at it.
            {% endbubble %}
            {% bubble Hiyori northinking %}
            Speaking of which, that rest area was quite spacious, wasn’t it?

            There was a shop with a long queue, too… I wonder what it had for sale?

            I’ll have it now, thank you.

        <div class="minitalk-option_content">
            {% bubble Hiyori nod %}
            Mhm, mhm! Drink it up while being grateful for my kindness~♪
            {% endbubble %}
            {% bubble Hiyori smilesoft %}
            You originally had something for me prepared, yet forgot to prepare your own… That’s just like you, Anzu-chan.

            However, while I appreciate your desires to look after idols, I’d love you to look after yourself, as well.
