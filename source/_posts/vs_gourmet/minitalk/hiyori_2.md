Oh, Anzu-chan. What are you doing here, might I ask?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Hiyori frown %}
I’m waiting for Jun-kun to finish changing his clothes. Gosh, he is *so* slow at it…!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Hiyori curious %}
…You’re a judge? Eh, you’ve also taken on the role of judge, Anzu-chan? Really?
{% endbubble %}

<div class="minitalk" character="Anzu">
    <div class="minitalk-option">
        <div class="minitalk-option_header">
            Yes, really.

        <div class="minitalk-option_content">
            {% bubble Hiyori frown2 %}
            Hmm…? I wish you told me that *much* earlier…
            {% endbubble %}
            {% bubble Hiyori norsmile %}
            It had to be kept a secret until the day of the audition? I see, that makes sense.

            You can’t afford to show bias towards ES idols either, and it would be a harsh job on you, wouldn’t it?

            The details will be announced later…

            {% bubble Hiyori curious %}
            It was just announced on the home page a moment ago…? Huh, I had no idea, as they had confiscated our phones.

            So it was written that they’ve scheduled an introduction for the judges later?
            {% endbubble %}
            {% bubble Hiyori snicker %}
            Fufu. There will surely be many idols who’ll be surprised to see Anzu-chan as a judge. This will be fun to witness…♪

{% bubble Hiyori norsmile %}
From Eden, only three of us are participating in 4piece: Me, Jun-kun, and Ibara.

Nagisa-kun has other things he must attend to… so he’ll be in the sidelines supporting us.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Hiyori northinking %}
Ibara? I wouldn’t know where he is. He should be here somewhere, no?
{% endbubble %}

<div class="minitalk" character="Anzu">
    <div class="minitalk-option">
        <div class="minitalk-option_header">
            Did you come here together with…?
        </div>
        <div class="minitalk-option_content">
            {% bubble Hiyori norsmile2 %}
            Mhm. I came here together with Jun-kun.

            I didn’t spot Ibara anywhere during our departure, though… Perhaps he had some work to do until the very last moment.
            {% endbubble %}
            {% bubble Hiyori smileexplain %}
            If you have something to speak to him about, how about contacting him? If he still hasn’t arrived to the venue, it should still be possible to get in contact by phone.
			{% endbubble %}
        </div>
    </div>
    <div class="minitalk-option">
        <div class="minitalk-option_header">
            So he isn’t here with you, right?
        </div>
        <div class="minitalk-option_content">
            {% bubble Hiyori frown %}
            Jun-kun offered Ibara to go together, but he declined, saying he has business.

            Good grief… Since it’s Ibara we’re talking about, I can’t help but think he’s scheming something.
            {% endbubble %}
            {% bubble Hiyori nod %}
            If he ever seems to be conspiring something, I’ll make sure to punish him, so don’t you worry!

{% bubble Hiyori srsthinking %}
…Actually, isn’t Jun-kun taking a little *too* long to change his clothes?

He’s typically much quicker to change than me… So he might’ve been caught by someone.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Hiyori norsmile %}
He might be in trouble somehow, so I’ll go check out how he’s doing in the dressing room, okay?
{% endbubble %}

            “I’ll be right here, so please call for me”? Oh no, I think it’s best that you head along now.

            If in the slight chance that some problem occurs, I’ll speak to the staff walking around here.
            {% endbubble %}
            {% bubble Hiyori smileexplain %}
            You should prioritize preparing for the screening and ensuring everything is in order, no?

            Will he be alright?

            {% bubble Hiyori norsmile2 %}
            As long as some big guy isn’t picking a fight with him, I don’t think there’s anything to worry about.

            If you’re really that worried, I’ll find the time to report back to you, so you’re free to go to the judges’ seat, Anzu-chan!
            {% endbubble %}
            {% bubble Hiyori smileconfident %}
            Alright then, I’ll see you later…♪ Make sure to provide me a proper evaluation on my radiance!
