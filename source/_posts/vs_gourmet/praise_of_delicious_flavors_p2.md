<div class="msr-narration">
    <p>Several minutes later, in the Gourmet District kitchen…</p>
</div>

{% bubble Chiaki frown %}
Shoot…! I never imagined that the ingredients would nearly all be taken away in that single instant…!

This puts me in a fix. I suppose it was only natural that people would aim for the main ingredients like meat and fish for a meal that goes with rice…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki srsthinking %}
I was hoping to make Chinese fried rice, but not only can I not find any meat, I can’t even spot any notable vegetables, either…

Mm~… What to do…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mayoi hidden %}
I did iiittt…♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki curious %}
Mm?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mayoi grin %}
Chiaki-san, I did it! Even I managed to purchase ingredients somehoww~!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki smile %}
Ooh, Ayase! I’m so glad to hear that!

So what sort of ingredients did you get?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mayoi smileconfident %}
Eggs! Now I can make omurice!

I’ve made omurice before for work, so I thought maybe even I could manage something with this…♪[^1]
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki curious %}
Eggs? Just eggs?

…Ermm, I’m hesitant to say this, but can you really call wrapping white rice with egg an omurice? I feel as though, normally, there’s chicken stir-fried rice inside.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mayoi idle %}
…………
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mayoi cryalmost %}
Uu, uuu— My audition is over! Completely smashed to smithereens and overrrrr!

It really was a mistake for someone like me to appear on such a grand stage like this!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mayoi sigh %}
If I’m simply going to expose such an unsightly image of myself, I’d rather withdraw straight away…!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki surprised %}
Hold on, wait a moment…!? Don’t fall to despair over one mistake!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mayoi worried %}
Uu… P-Please let me goo~! And then let me disappeaaarrrr……
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki awkward %}
Mm~… But just by watching Ayase, I can’t help but be reminded of Takamine when I first met him, and so I can’t get myself to leave you on your own…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki smilesoft %}
Anyhow, don’t worry about it! I’m the same as you, Ayase! I couldn’t buy any notable ingredients either.

But we can’t afford to sit here and make nothing, right?

So why don’t we devise a meal we can serve for the time being!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mayoi worried %}
Chiaki-saaan…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mitsuru grin %}
Chia-chan-senpai\~ Mayo-chan-senpai\~! Look, look\~☆
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Raika %}
Please look over here, if you may~☆
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki %}
Oh! Tenma-kun and Hojo-kun. It sounds like the two of you got yourselves some fine ingredients.

Hojo-kun, are those vegetables?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Raika %}
It certainly is! I’m thinkin’ of makin’ a meal I’m very familiar with.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki smilesoft %}
Ah, so the taste of one’s home, right? That sounds wonderful, go for it! ☆ And as for Tenma-kun—
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mitsuru niyaclosed %}
Mine is wheat flour~!

I’m gonna make loads of bread with this flour!

‘Cuz I’ve decided that if I’m gonna open a business, it’s gonna be a bakery!

I’ll totally make it the best bakery on the planet! One that’s completely mastered every single type of bread across the world\~! I’m super excited\~♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki surprised %}
There was someone even wilder than Ayase…!?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki awkward %}
Ermm, today’s theme is “meal using rice”, y’know?

I don’t mean to deny your dream, Tenma-kun, but wouldn’t it be unwise to turn your restaurant into a bakery…?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mitsuru surprised %}
Eh, ahh!? You’re right!?

Oh yeah, Nice-P did mention “meal using rice”! I completely forgot~!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mitsuru worried %}
W-What am I gonna do!? It’s not good enough if I just have bread, right…?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mayoi srsthinking %}
A-Ah, yes… Since rice is specified for today’s meal, you won’t be able to receive a legitimate evaluation unless you use it, I believe.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mitsuru sighdrop %}
I’m in trouble now~!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Hiyori frown %}
Gosh, how noisy.

I was wondering what sort of kids were making such a ruckus; so it was all of you, wasn’t it?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki %}
Ooh! It’s Tomoe! Are you also pondering over what meal to make?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Hiyori yare %}
Don’t lump me in the same group as all of you. Just how much time do you think has passed since the screening began?

I’ve already decided on my meal, and was just about to start cooking.

In fact, shouldn’t all of you be looking at your surroundings a little bit more?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki serious %}
…? What do you mean?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Hiyori serious %}
The audition has already begun, but you’re helping friends and making idle talk.

It’s about time you realize that all of you are becoming dead in the water by trying to comfort each other.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Hiyori frown %}
While a sympathetic heart is a virtue… In this situation, it is simply absurd.

Do you truly believe you can hold hands and run to “reach the goal together~♪” without any sort of betrayal before reaching said goal?

If you truly think so, then that’s quite the flowery daydream you’re having there!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki worried %}
Uu—… There’s no need to speak as if there’s a traitor among us, is there? There’s just no way there’s anyone like that here!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Hiyori frown2 %}
Dear me… That sort of mentality truly is just like ‘Yumenosaki’, isn’t it?

Well, it doesn’t matter either way.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Hiyori idle %}
I had hoped you’d show me yet another changed form of yourself since our time in Reverse Live—[^2]

You said this morning that we would “clash against each other”, but if this is all you have, then you can’t come close to being my opponent, can you, Chiaki-kun?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Hiyori norsmile %}
May you all do your utmost best not to sink together hand-in-hand. Right, see you then. ♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki idle %}
…………
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mayoi curious %}
W-What on earth was that…?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Raika worried %}
Umm… If I may ask, is it wrong to get along? That’s how I heard it, but…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki smilesoft %}
Nope, not one bit! It’s true that 4piece is an individual contest, but there’s no way there’s anything wrong with helping one another, right?

That was likely Tomoe’s own way of giving a firm pep talk. Although, his wording was pretty harsh…

But Tomoe does also have a point.

After all, we won’t be able to get any meals prepared if we all stand here frozen.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki fist %}
So how about for now, we all just focus on each of our meals before us!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mitsuru grin %}
Mhm! I’ll also try thinking up a meal that uses rice and wheat flour!
{% endbubble %}

## Chapter 9

{% img https://f005.backblazeb2.com/file/reitoouji/ro_66b3b21dlpKW1550.webp?timestamp=1723052581482 %}

<div class="msr-narration">
    <p>Several minutes later. At a corner in Gourmet District. Chiaki’s Restaurant…</p>
</div>

{% bubble Chiaki smilesoft %}
—Alright. And now, it’s complete!

I wasn’t sure what I was going to do when all the notable ingredients were completely gone, but I think I managed to make something I can put up in the store?

I’ve got my own special move to smash through this hopeless situation! And that is none other than…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki grin %}
Grilled onigiri!

Fuhahahaha! ☆ I never imagined that here of all places is when I’d remember the grilled onigiri Mikejima-san cooked for me![^3]

It’s definitely something I’d consider a prominent memory for me!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki norsmile2 %}
Well, the ones Mikejima-san was selling had a special secret soy-based sauce, so mine can’t be on par with that taste.

But I think I at least managed to make some pretty delicious grilled onigiri under normal standards…♪

Now, while I’m grilling them — If I can get the customers to smell the savory aroma of the onigiri by wafting its scent with a fan, I’m sure many will come to my restaurant.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki smileconfident %}
Fan, fan, fan…♪ *<th>(Humming)</th>*

How’s <em>that</em> for a savory aroma! A scent like this should make the customers unable to resist taking a peek at my restaurant!

Fuhaha. This is a pretty clever strategy for something I came up with impromptu! ☆

Come on over and get some! You’re missing out on delicious grilled onigiri~!
{% endbubble %}

<div class="msr-narration">
    <p>Time passes…</p>
</div>

{% bubble Chiaki norsmile %}
—Whew. And with that, I think I’m all sold out?

I’m so glad I managed it in the end somehow…! Although, the price was pretty low, so I didn’t really make much of a profit.

But considering how I first started out in the audition, this result is superb.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki northinking %}
Right then… Grilled onigiri doesn’t take too much time to prepare, so it looks like I have a lot of time to spare…?

Well, I suppose I <em>could</em> just wait until the screening ends, but…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki smile %}
…Oh, I know! I could check out how the other restaurants are doing. Everyone struggled to get ingredients, so I’m curious about what happened afterwards.
{% endbubble %}

<div class="msr-narration">
    <p>Screen transitions to a different area in Gourmet District</p>
</div>

{% bubble Raika hidden %}
♪\~♪\~♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki curious %}
…Mm? Who’s singing…?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Raika grin %}
♪\~♪\~♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki %}
<th>(Ooh! Hojo-kun has a crowd in front of his store.)</th>

<th>(So he attracted customers through song? That’s a pretty impressive idea you’ve come up with, Hojo-kun…!)</th>
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki smilesoft2 %}
<th>(That being said, what a pretty singing voice. As a listener, the tune draws me in, putting me in a pleasant mood in spite of myself.)</th>

<th>(Mm. I can see how this made so many people gather.)</th>
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Raika smileconfident %}
—Thank ya for listenin’ to the very end! Please do have a bite of my restaurant’s food after this.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki %}
Hojo-kun. You have a packed crowd, don’t you! I’m relieved to see it!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Raika grin %}
<em>Ah</em>, Chiaki-oniisan. How kind of ya to visit my restaurant!

Please do try some of the food too, if that’s alright. There’s no need to pay~♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki curious %}
Are you sure? If that really is alright with you, I’d love to try it, but—
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Raika nod %}
‘Course it is. I’ll make one for ya right now, so please wait! I’ll treat ya to a meal from my memories!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki smilesoft %}
<th>(A meal from Hojo-kun’s memories, huh. Is it something like the taste of his home’s cooking? I’m so excited to try it out…♪)</th>
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Raika grin %}
—I’m sorry to have kept ya waitin’! Please eat as much as ya like until you’re full…♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki grin %}
I’ll gladly do so; thanks for the fooood~! ☆
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki surprised %}
Gyoh—!? H-Hojo-kun. What on earth is this inexplicable white object, and this thick, mushy green object…?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Raika niyaclosed %}
Ahem! ☆ It’s the meal from my memories!

Ah, but I’m usin’ spinach this time. The usual was made with wild grasses, so this is much more fancy than the one from my memories!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki shocked %}
Fancy!? *This!?* It almost seems like animal food, though—
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Raika curious %}
…? Is there somethin’ strange about it? The other customers keep havin’ a similar reaction to Chiaki-oniisan, too…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki smileconfident %}
I see, I see; you must’ve gone through a whole lot of struggles, haven’t you? When 4piece is over, I’ll treat you to much tastier meals to your heart’s content, Hojo-kun…!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Raika blushjoy %}
Eh!? Is it really okay!? Yaaay, I’m so excited~♪
{% endbubble %}

<div class="msr-narration">
    <p>Screen transitions to a different area in Gourmet District</p>
</div>

{% bubble Chiaki awkward %}
…That surprised me. I never imagined the meal would look like something a prehistoric creature used to eat…

Rather than the events of this audition, I’m a lot more worried about how Hojo-kun’s been living his life up to now.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki %}
Right, next up is Tenma-kun and Ayase—
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mayoi hidden %}
*Mumblemumble, mumblemumblemumble*…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki surprised %}
Eeep—!? W-What is that eerie low sutra-sounding voice!?[^4]
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki worried %}
…Is it coming from this alleyway?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mayoi hidden %}
…it…I… can’t… d……t…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki worried2 %}
Huh!? This is just freaky!

I <em>really</em> just want to pretend I didn’t notice it and wave it off as a hallucination, but… Do I <em>have</em> to go and see what it is~!?[^5]
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mayoi hidden %}
…Chiaki-san.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki worried %}
Eeeep—!? I’m sorry! I’m really sorry for almost trying to pretend I never noticed! So I beg you, please don’t call for my name and curse me…![^6]

…………
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki srsthinking %}
…Hold on. On second thought, that can’t be the case…? No matter how you look at it, it’s impossible for a ghost to specifically call me by name.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki curious %}
Ermmm? I-Is there someone there, by any chance…?[^6]
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mayoi worried %}
Umm, Chiaki-san…?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki awkward %}
Haah, what~ So it was you all along, Ayase…!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki smileconfident %}
What are you doing over there? It’s scary to hear someone mumbling while crouched down in an alleyway, y’know? Ah, but I wasn’t scared or anything, okay!?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mayoi sad2 %}
Uu, I’m sorry, I’m sorry. I apologize for frightening you, but I just can’t do this anymore…!

Even after all those uplifting words you gave to the likes of me, Chiaki-san… I simply don’t think I’ll be able to live up to your encouragement, and it makes me feel so pathetic…!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki serious %}
C’mon, what’s wrong? The contest has only just begun!

Actually, what happened to your restaurant? Did you not finish making your meal in the end?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mayoi sad3 %}
Erm, no, I was able to cook my meal.

Though there isn’t any meat in it, I was able to make it pretty tasty despite its simplicityyy…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki nod %}
Then that’s great to hear, isn’t it!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mayoi sad4 %}
But, um… Then there’s serving customers.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki curious %}
Serving customers?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mayoi sad %}
Yes. When I helped out at the cafe, I only managed to work hard purely because everyone was there with me, but…[^1]

I feel so helpless all on my own this time, that I couldn’t prevent myself from peeling off the wallpaper or the ceiling to conceal myself in a crack…

Yet, customers would continue to visit my restaurant. And I can’t afford to not serve them, correct?

So without any other method at hand, I tried to greet and serve them from their blind spots, only for all my customers to become frightened right away.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mayoi worried %}
And then, before I knew it… My restaurant became treated as a haunted spooottt…!
{% endbubble %}

## Chapter 10

<div class="msr-narration">
    <p>At the same time, at Mitsuru’s restaurant…</p>
</div>

{% bubble Mitsuru sighdrop %}
Mmph, I messed up~…

I’m supposed to make a meal using rice, but I instead bought flour… This is what they call “the greatest mistake of one’s life”!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mitsuru smile %}
But I know there’s no point in moping over it. I just gotta make do with what I’ve got right now!

I have cooked rice, wheat flour, and… lots of seasoning.

Mm~… I gotta make a meal using rice, so? A dish with rice as the leading role instead of bread would be good, right…?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mitsuru sighfrown %}
Uu… This is so hard~… I mean, both bread <em>and</em> rice are staple foods, so they’re both meant to be leading roles…?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mitsuru curious %}
Huh? Wait, but I think the leading role of a rice meal is the side dish you eat with it…?[^7]

After all, when my mom tells me that today’s meal is hamburger steak, I look forward to eating the steak, not the rice![^8]

Then does that mean I gotta make a side dish with the ingredients I have here…?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mitsuru srsthinking %}
…………
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mitsuru worried %}
Uu\~ Uuu\~? Nothing makes sense anymore! Rice or the side dish… Which is the leading role of a meal\~…?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mitsuru smileconfident %}
Ah—! But aren’t there times when I have a meal without a side dish, that still excites me lots!?

—That’s it! I thought up something suuuper good!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mitsuru surprised %}
Ahh—! So much time passed while I was thinking…!

I gotta hurry and make it! I’ll go make the food in a dash dash~☆
{% endbubble %}

<div class="msr-narration">
    <p>Screen transitions to a different area in Gourmet District</p>
</div>

{% bubble Chiaki idle %}
As you’d expect from an audition; it appears that everyone’s having a pretty rough time…

Right. I wonder how Tenma-kun’s doing? It seemed to me that his biggest problem was the ingredients, but…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki curious %}
Ah, he hasn’t opened his restaurant yet. Is he preparing the food right now?

Mm~… I’d rather not disturb him by greeting him at an awkward timing…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki norsmile2 %}
…Mm? Ooh. I should be able to peek at how he’s doing in the kitchen from this window, at least.

<th>(I’ll check what he’s up to quietly, without disturbing him—…)</th>
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mitsuru grin %}
Doughy, doughy, doughyyy\~♪ Knead, knead, knead, kneaaad\~♪

Yummy, yummy, that’s what you’ll be…![^9]

Ahem! I’m so smart~! What a genius idea! ☆

It never had to be only one leading role! I’ll just make you <em>all</em> leading roles~♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki hidden %}
……?
{% endbubble %}

<div class="msr-narration">
    <p>At the same time, at Ritsu’s restaurant…</p>
</div>

{% bubble Ritsu smileexplain %}
Here you go, enjoy the food. It’s Sakuma Ritsu’s special deluxe: “Jet Black Risotto of Chaos”~[^10]

It’s got a peculiar look to it? That may be so, but it’s known for its delicious taste, so no worries.

Right, I finished selling out everything today~ And so, I’m sorry to say this, but I’m closing up shop for the day.

I’ll make a dish you can only get a taste of at this restaurant again tomorrow, so come back and have a bite then.

See you then, bye byee~♪ *<th>(waves)</th>*
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Ritsu sightired %}
*…Huff…* I’m sooo tired\~ I really didn’t plan on working this hard, y’know\~…

But ‘cause it was kinda fun making the food, and everyone enjoyed eating it on top of that, I put in a lot more effort than I had planned.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Ritsu frownshake %}
I worked <em>this</em> hard the whole day, so someone better pamper me…!

Ma~kun, whichever venue you’re in right now! Come rush over here and praise me super sweetly — say, “You worked so hard, Ricchan” to me…![^11]
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Hiyori norsmile %}
—Oh? So you sold out, hm?

Not bad. I was wondering who would report next that they’d sold out, but to think it was Ritsu-kun’s restaurant, hm?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Hiyori frown2 %}
I was interested in the most popular dish after mine, but if it’s sold out, then I can’t eat it now, can I? What a shame; such terrible weather!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Ritsu curious %}
Mm~? If it isn’t Hiyohiyo. What, are you keeping an eye on your enemy’s next move?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Hiyori smileconfident %}
Why yes, I’m killing time while observing my opponent! My dish sold out, you see.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Ritsu norsmile %}
Huh. If I’m not mistaken, Hiyohiyo made paella, yeah?[^12]

I heard about it through all the customers talking. According to rumors, the paella was lavished with high-class seafood and was super tasty.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Hiyori grin %}
Wow! You’re also quite the shrewd one, aren’t you, Ritsu-kun! But well, we’re talking about <em>my</em> restaurant, so of course it’d become the talk around here. ♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Ritsu norsmile %}
I had the impression that you’re someone who can’t really cook, though. So this is pretty surprising~

Or is it by any chance that, like, cooking is also a hobby for aristocrats?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Hiyori smug %}
There’s no such thing as the impossible for me, after all! ☆

—But, well, that’s simply a joke!

I haven’t cooked that many times before, but sometimes I appear in a cooking show for work with Eden or Eve, that’s why.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Ritsu v2 %}
Huh, so you guys also appear in cooking shows? Didn’t know that.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Hiyori yare %}
It’s because for a period of time, there was a trend where they made idols who are terrible at cooking attempt to make a dish, and then praise them endlessly for how adorable they look while floundering about.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Hiyori smilesoft %}
But well, Jun-kun was usually the one who’d be the sacrifice in those cases…♪

I made paella in a show before, so I simply reproduced the recipe flawlessly!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Ritsu smileconfident %}
Oh, I see. Then today’s contest was just particularly advantageous for you, is all, huh.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Hiyori snicker %}
A naive one, aren’t you! As long as I’ve secured a strong influence from the very first day, I believe I’ll be able to hold onto those raving reviews for the next day and beyond, you know?

Right. It’s almost the end of today’s screening. I can’t wait to see the results. ♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Hiyori curious %}
—Mm? It looks pretty crowded on the other side; whose restaurant is that?

{% bubble Mitsuru grin %}
Nice-P, thanks for waiting~! Here you go, it’s Tenma Mitsuru’s special deluxe: “Curry Rice Bread”!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Nice %}
Ooh…! This complex, spicy aroma that tingles my nasal cavity…! I can tell just through that alone that this will be a Nice curry!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mitsuru %}
Ehehe. I never ever saw it coming that Nice-P’s favorite food’d be curry!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Nice %}
Well then, I’ll have a bite right away. If the food gets cold while talking, then it’d be like disrespecting the feelings of the person who made it.

…Thank you for the food!

*<th>(Munch, munch)</th>…*
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Nice nod %}
OOOOOOOOOHH!? T-This is…!

The crunchy fried savory bread and the curry is <em>Perfectly</em> put together…![^13] What’s more, this faint sweet taste that tingles the tip of my tongue…

Is this rice!?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mitsuru fist %}
You got it~! ☆ Today’s theme is a meal using rice, so I didn’t just make curry bread, but curry <em>rice</em> bread![^14]
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Nice winknice %}
What incredible creativity…! I must bestow upon you your very own Nice, Tenma-kun…☆

I can just feel it with every bite — How the rice doesn’t get in the way while being inside the curry bread, and instead feels like an actual ‘leading role’.

At this point, this is no mere curry rice bread; I believe it could even be called a “<em>Rice</em> Curry Bread” where the rice is the leading role. What do you think, Tenma-kun!?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mitsuru grin %}
Ehehe. It was kinda hard, but I managed to make it a reality somehow~♪ It’s my very own bread, that can’t be found in any other bakery!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Nice %}
What a Nice approach! Considering one must make profit immediately in Gourmet District, that’s a plan of action one can’t even adopt in the first place.

To think you would focus on being imaginative and creative in such a limited amount of time, and develop up a whole new dish that nobody has ever tasted before…[^15]

Very Nice! If this is your tactic to win throughout the audition, then your talents are more frightening than anyone could ever foresee…♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mitsuru grin %}
I don’t really know anything about tactics and stuff. I just tried making something while enjoying it myself!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Nice smilesoft %}
Indeed, I expect nothing less from a member of Ra*bits.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mitsuru curious %}
Huh? Nice-P, you know about Ra*bits?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Nice norsmile %}
Fufu, there are many things I could talk about regarding all of you, but…[^16]

Ah, no, as a judge, I would simply be meddling if I were to speak any further than this. Talking endlessly is a bad habit of mine.

Oh dear. It seems that it’s about time for the screening evaluation.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mitsuru surprised %}
Huh? Ah! You’re right!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Nice %}
Right, see you another time. Let’s meet at the evaluation!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mitsuru grin %}
Mhm. Bye byee~! ☆ *<th>(waves)</th>*

{% bubble Nice %}
“—Now then. All participants, allow me to congratulate you for your hard work first and foremost. How was the first day for you?”

“I’m sure there were some participants among you all who couldn’t make as much profit as they had hoped.”

“We’ve now come to the end of the first day’s screening for the second venue, Gourmet District!”

“For today’s sales ranking, it’s scheduled to display on the screen in thirty minutes from now.”

“There are six days left. There are still many opportunities left to convey your bountiful charms.”

“I hope that you show us that radiance thoroughly to the very end…!”

<div class="msr-narration">
    <p>Thirty minutes later. At the center of Gourmet District, in front of the screen…</p>
</div>

{% bubble Raika smileconfident %}
Ah! Chiaki-oniisan! May I ask how it went at your restaurant?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki fist %}
I made grilled onigiri, and I managed to sell out in the end!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki norsmile2 %}
…I have to show my thanks to Mikejima-san. It was precisely because of the memory of that day that I was able to come up with the genius idea of making grilled onigiri.

I feel like this whole day proved to me that all my accumulated efforts and experience won’t betray me.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki awkward %}
But, well, the price of one was low, so my sales weren’t good or anything.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Raika nod %}
But, but, it’s amazin’ that you were able to sell out! I wanted to have a bite of that grilled onigiri, too…!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mitsuru grin %}
Ah! Raika-chan, Chia-chan-senpai, Mayo-chan-senpai\~! I hope it all went well for you guys\~!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki smilesoft %}
Ooh, the same back to you. Is it all of us here now? It must’ve been rough for everyone from the first day…!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mayoi sad2 %}
It waasss, just about everything was painful…

Also, just remembering that that frightening scramble for ingredients awaits us again from tomorrow onwards makes me depresseeddd…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki idle %}
Yeah. We don’t know what tomorrow’s designated meal will be, but it seems likely that the scramble will have a heavy hand in who wins.

Depending on the theme, we could be forced into a relentless battle.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mitsuru grin %}
I got to enjoy myself a whole bunch, actually! Although, I started making it real late, so I couldn’t make a lotta profit.

But! I had fun, so it’s all good! Plus, Nice-P praised the bread I made~♪ He even gave it the name “Rice Curry Bread”!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Raika nod %}
Ooh! So amazin’, just as expected of Mitsuru-oniisan!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Raika awkward %}
Ehihi… I wasn’t able to do anythin’ but attract customers through singin’.

For some reason, whenever I brought out the food, everyone would show a twitched smile and then happily leave my restaurant…?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki srsthinking %}
Well, since it was <em>that</em>… It was naturally a little too shocking for the customers, probably?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mitsuru curious %}
…?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mayoi curious %}
…?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mitsuru curious %}
So Raika-chan’s food was that amazing?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki awkward %}
Ah, no, um. It’s a little difficult to explain, but… It was such an avant-garde meal that the modern person couldn’t ever hope to accept…?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mitsuru smileconfident %}
Ehh\~ What’s that!? I’m so curious! I wanna try it out\~!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Raika fist %}
Then when the audition is over, I’ll pour all my efforts into makin’ one!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki smile %}
Mm. That also sounds nice, but how about you and I go eat tasty food together after 4piece is over? And since this is such a special occasion, it would be nice to go with everyone here, too.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Raika blushjoy %}
Yaaay! ♪ Food with Chiaki-oniisan~♪

Ehihi. Just today alone, I encountered so many kind people.

4piece is an individual contest, right? So even though I’m supposed to be everyone’s opponent… When I was in trouble, ya saved me without ever abandonin’ me.

I’m so fortunate to have this! I’ll never, ever forget these kind favors from all of ya, Onii-sans…!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki %}
I appreciate your feelings, Hojo-kun, but you don’t need to keep thanking us, y’know?

While it’s true that the audition is an individual contest, don’t you know we’re all one and same here, as companions from ES? ☆
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mitsuru %}
Exactly! That’s why it’s only natural to help out whenever you’re in trouble~ Opponents or whatever doesn’t matter at all!

—You’re all so intimate as always, aren’t you?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mitsuru %}
Ah! Hiyori-senpai and Ritsu-chan-senpai! I hope it all went well for both of you, too!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Ritsu sigh %}
You too\~ Haah, I’m so exhausted… Man, Mayomayo will do at this point, so soothe me\~?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mayoi surprised %}
W-Why are you leaning against me!? I believe Chiaki-san would be much more dependable here…!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Ritsu frownshake %}
Mm\~… Moririn feels suffocating, and I won’t be able to handle it if he starts yelling energetically in my ear. Mayomayo still seems way better in that respect\~
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki %}
Oh yeah, it sounded like Tomoe’s restaurant was flourishing considerably. Even around my restaurant, everyone was talking about how delicious the paella was!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Raika %}
Ah! So “pa-ela” was the name of a dish?

I kept catchin’ word of it, but I had no idea what people were talkin’ about.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Hiyori smileexplain %}
Heh-heh. If the opportunity ever arrives, I’ll do the honor of whipping some up for all of you. ♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Hiyori smilesoft %}
That aside, it feels as though the air of tension gets chipped off when I’m near all of you.

Well, since the first day of the screening is already over, I would simply exhaust myself if I continue to stay on guard, so I don’t really mind.

All that’s left is to wait for the announcement of the first day’s results. It seems that they’ve been tallying up the score while we’ve been closing up shop—
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mitsuru %}
Ah! Guys, look at the screen! I think they’re gonna start announcing the results! Let’s see, let’s see…
{% endbubble %}

<div class="msr-narration">
    <p>Sound of a drum roll</p>
</div>

{% bubble Chiaki nod %}
Ooh! That’s impressive… Tomoe and Sakuma are first and second place!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Hiyori %}
Fufu. It’s only natural that I would be shining the brightest. It’s absolutely unthinkable for there to be anyone but <em>me</em> dazzling so brilliantly at the top of this audition…♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Ritsu v2 %}
Oh, so I couldn’t get first place, huh~ Well, this is pretty good work as is.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Raika nod %}
Incredible, as you would expect from Sakuma-sama! Pardon me for not realizin’ sooner that you would excel even at cooking!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mayoi sad2 %}
Uu, but Ritsu-san, you said that we’re the ‘enjoying ourselves group’…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Ritsu smileconfident %}
Sorry~ I can’t have Hiyohiyo be the sole winner in something I excel at, so I got real into it before I even knew it…♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mitsuru worried %}
It was pretty good for me ‘cuz I had fun, but losing a contest makes me feel frustrated~! Uuu, I’m so conflicted!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Raika curious %}
Mm? Isn’t there somethin’ written at the end of the screen?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mitsuru %}
Ah, you’re right! The text for the top rankers was so big that I didn’t notice.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mitsuru curious %}
Erm, “Sending to the fields: Ayase Mayoi”…?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mayoi shocked %}
S-Sending to the fiieeeeeldsss!?

    <p>Nearly an hour later. In the hotel within the center of the 4piece venue…</p>

{% bubble Mitsuru sigh %}
Uu\~ I’m so tired\~!

{% bubble Chiaki awkward %}
Haha, I never imagined that we’d manage a restaurant… We had to attract customers and serve them all on our own, so even I’m pretty worn out from exhaustion.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mitsuru frownshake %}
It’s like, my body is well enough to dash, but I used my head way too much, so I don’t wanna think anymore…!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mitsuru curious %}
By the way, I wonder what’s gonna happen to Mayo-chan-senpai?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki srsthinking %}
Ah, yeah. I never imagined there would be a punishment game for last place…[^17] Actually, I’m not sure I understand what ‘sending to the fields’ even means here.

The staff took Ayase away somewhere after it was announced that he was in last place, but I wonder if he’s safe…

I hope he isn’t caught up in anything dangerous…
{% endbubble %}

<div class="msr-narration">
    <p>At the same time, in the Gourmet District fields…</p>
</div>

{% bubble Mayoi curious %}
…I never once expected there to actually be a field next to Gourmet District.

All I can really say is that it’s a vegetable field with crops planted, but… It almost feels like a prison, perhaps due to it feeling as if one is trapped within the surrounding fences.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mayoi shocked %}
Hwah—? W-What are these cotton gloves and this scoop for…?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mayoi worried %}
Erm, wait, um… Simply passing me these and ordering me to work won’t be enough for me to know what to do…!?

{% bubble Chiaki %}
Well, it’s held within the program, so his life’s likely not threatened in any way. All we can do for now is take a peek at how he’s doing.

Right. How about we go grab a bite for a change of pace?

We already feel this worn out from the very first day — If we don’t properly nourish ourselves for tomorrow onwards, our stamina could drop to nothing…!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mitsuru %}
Mhm! I think so too.

Oh yeah, I’ve been wondering about how Raika-chan’s doing, so I wanna try getting in touch with him.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki smilesoft %}
You’re right, he didn’t really seem to have any other people he knew, either… He must feel helpless all alone and surrounded by adults. Let’s group up with him.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mitsuru grin %}
Whew\~ That was so tasty\~♪ Fried chicken, ramen, hamburger steak… I ate so much that my tummy could burst!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki %}
Yeah. Even though we were surrounded by food all day, we couldn’t really afford to take our time eating during the contest, after all.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mitsuru %}
Mhm! And they had tasty-looking bread, so I asked for a wrapped takeaway~♪

You can never have too much bread\~! Right, Raika-chan\~♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Raika %}
Aye. This place is like heaven; you never have to worry about food…!

There’s always food right before my eyes, I don’t even have to try catchin’ some for myself! I want them to allow me to live here…!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mitsuru %}
Ahaha, an idol living in the audition venue’d be real weird~♪

If that really did happen, your friends and family would worry about you. It’d be lonely living in a place this big all on your own, y’know?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Raika awkward %}
…………
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki serious %}
Speaking of which, Hojo-kun. You’re roommates with Ayase, right? I haven’t seen him anywhere, but… Could it be that he still hasn’t returned to his room?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Raika worried %}
That’s exactly right. Even when I ask a staff member, all they tell me is to “not worry about it and just sleep”…

It’s a pleasant room to be in, with a soft and fluffy bed… But it seems that bein’ in such a big room all by myself makes it hard for me to relax.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki grin %}
I completely understand your situation, Hojo-kun! Alright then, how about you sleep over in our room?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Raika surprised %}
Huh, is that really okay?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mitsuru fist %}
There’s only one answer to that! Of course it is, and I’m all up for it too!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Raika blushjoy %}
Yaaay! ♪ Tonight’s a sleepover party at Mitsuru-oniisan and Chiaki-oniisan’s room!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mitsuru grin %}
Kyahoo! ☆ A sleepover party means I get to talk with Raika-chan for as long as I want! Let’s stay up late and talk about all sortsa things together!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Raika smilesoft2 %}
Ehihi. Somehow, it’s almost like that helplessness I was feeling was just a lie, as if it never happened.

I’m so glad I got to meet Mitsuru-oniisan and Chiaki-oniisan…♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mitsuru nod %}
If you ever feel lonely, you can always come to me anytime. You’re free to rely on me for anything as your idol senior~♪

No, not just as a senior — Raika-chan and I are *‘friends’* now!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Raika blushshocked %}
…Fr…iends…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki nod %}
Ooohh! That line was incredible, Tenma-kun! I’m so moved! This perfectly newborn friendship has me emotional…!

No matter the outcome of the audition, friendship is eternal. That’s what I believe, at least…!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Raika nod2 %}
Ehihi, havin’ someone call me a friend… There wasn’t anyone who called me that before, not even at the “facility”, y’know?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki idle %}
I might be prying a little by asking, but — What exactly is this “facility”? Is it something like an orphanage?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Raika curious %}
Orphanage? My father and mother are alive, though.

Due to family rules, I had to stand on my own once I became eleven years old, so I haven’t seen them in a while, but… they’re probably doin’ okay?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Raika frown %}
While I’d become independent… I was someone who lived life nonchalantly until then, so there was practically nothin’ I was capable of doin’.

I couldn’t even earn cash, so I did whatever it took to survive. Or rather, I had no choice <em>but</em> to do whatever it took…

And then, while bein’ the mangy petty thief I am, I was taken into custody by “sensei” one day. That was when my life began in the “facility”.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Raika serious %}
I learned many things there. The ways for a dimwit such as myself to properly live in the world, the rules to adapt in human society…

And also, that if I ever do a “bad thing”, then I must cancel out my sin by doin’ a “good thing”.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki idle %}
…………
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Raika norsmile %}
There were many things about my life in the “facility” that were harsh and painful, but I didn’t suffer any problems with basic life necessities.

And as I was livin’ my life in the “facility”, Sakuma Jii-sama came over and took me home with him.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Raika smilesoft2 %}
Ehihi, Sakuma Jii-sama is the one who taught me about music~♪

After that, I started to earn pocket money by singin’ on the streets…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mitsuru nod %}
Ah! That’s when Raika-chan was scouted by Nice-P, right? I heard about this earlier!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Raika smile %}
Aye. He told me to come to 4piece, and so I temporarily became part of ES!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki norsmile %}
So that’s how it was. I had thought there were some complicated matters behind it all…

At any rate, we might become a bother to others if we stand here and talk any longer. Let’s carry on the rest of this conversation in our room!

Plus, the audition will continue from tomorrow onwards too. While we can enjoy some chatter, we also need to sleep early and recover our stamina~♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mitsuru %}
Mhm! Raika-chan, you’ll be sleeping with me in the same futon!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Raika shocked %}
I-Is it really okay? I can sleep even on the cold bare ground, y’know?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mitsuru worried %}
You’ll just get sick if you do that! And we won’t be able to talk, either!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mitsuru grin %}
If Raika-chan runs away, I’ll make sure to hug and squeeze you sooo tight so you don’t! ☆
{% endbubble %}

<div class="msr-narration">
    <p>Next day, Gourmet District…</p>
</div>

{% bubble Nice %}
To all participants, good morning! I hope you were all able to have a good night’s sleep yesterday.

Let’s get straight to it. It’s time to announce the theme for the second day — Today’s designated meal is: “Tom yum goong”!

Tom yum goong represents Thai cuisine, and its charm lies in the peculiar taste of so many spices interweaving with one another. I look forward to seeing how you will all present that cuisine!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki surprised %}
T-Tom yum goong…?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Raika curious %}
What on earth is that? The name sounds like a god of some country…? I can’t even imagine what it tastes like.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Nice %}
Fufu, I’m sure there are plenty of idols here who have never tried this cuisine before.

Among the things we’ll be evaluating you on, one will also be on how you will investigate this “unknown flavor”, and then express it in your own way.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Raika srsthinking %}
Tomyamgun…[^18]
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki frown %}
I’m sorry. I wish I could let you know what sort of dish it is — but the truth is, I also only know it by name, and have never tried it before.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki curious %}
What about you, Tenma-kun? Do you know what sort of dish tom yum goong is?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mitsuru northinking %}
Mm~? I dunno what sorta dish tom…myamungun is, either.[^19]
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki sightired %}
I see… This puts us in a fix. I never imagined that we’d get a dish none of us know…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Ritsu v2 %}
Ohh? You seem troubled, huh?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki idle %}
Sakuma. Could it be that you’re aware what sort of dish tom yum goong is?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Ritsu v2 %}
Yup. Tom yum goong is a “sour and spicy soup”.[^20]
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki smile %}
Ooh, thank you! So which ingredients do you need to make tom yum goong?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Ritsu grin %}
Okay, that’s all\~ There’s a fee from this point on\~
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mitsuru surprised %}
Ehhh—!? You told us the start, but won’t tell us the end!?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Ritsu norsmile2 %}
Weeell~? If there’s some merit from giving you this info, then that’s a different story.

But no matter what world you’re in, info is the perfect material for negotiations, soo… I think you should show me gratitude for at least telling you what sort of dish tom yum goong is, y’know?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki sighfrown %}
Unh—… Sakuma’s got a point there…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mitsuru sigh %}
So in the end, the only thing we got to know is that tom yum goong is a sour and spicy soup…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki srsthinking %}
Mm~… Still, if we keep pondering here, all the ingredients will disappear again…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki fist %}
For now, we just need to prioritize purchasing our ingredients!

We know it’s sour and spicy, so let’s go and get our own sour and spicy ingredients!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Ritsu smile %}
<th>(Moririn and the others sure are earnest about this~ It looks like they’re trying their hardest to make tom yum goong, but…)</th>
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Ritsu northinking %}
Mm~… What am I gonna do, huh…

<th>(Honestly, I don’t think they’re hoping we get the right answer for today’s meal.)</th>
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Ritsu frown %}
<th>(Yesterday’s theme was “meal using rice”; something simple that anyone can make a dish out of…)</th>

<th>(Yet today is tom yum goong, a dish only an extremely tiny amount of people here would know.)</th>

The difficulty <em>clearly</em> increased way too much. It’s plain as day, seriously.

They’re not expecting every single person to be capable of making the correct dish… In other words, the judges have got a different goal to this assignment.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Ritsu v2 %}
That’s exactly why, the most important thing here is—

    <p>At the same time, in the Gourmet District kitchen…</p>

{% bubble Hiyori smileconfident %}
—How you’ll put effort into advertising yourself, right!

<th>(Most of the participants in the venue aren’t proficient in cooking, and I’m not a chef to begin with, either.)</th>

<th>(So instead of pointlessly wasting time on something you can’t do, you should instead pour effort into what you <em>can</em> do.)</th>
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Hiyori smilesoft %}
Mm~… Well, this taste is permissible, I suppose?

Considering I’ll directly serve customers at the table myself, this is actually more than permissible — I could even get some pocket change for this…♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mitsuru surprised %}
Wha—! Hiyori-senpai, you already finished cooking!? I’d love you to teach me how to make it, too!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Hiyori %}
I don’t know how to cook tom yum goong at all, though?

But I’ve <em>tried</em> tom yum goong before. So I simply copied the appearance and taste by relying on my memory!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mitsuru idle %}
Mhm? Then why’re you so confident of yourself?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Hiyori %}
That’s because I believe the true essence behind today’s theme isn’t in judging the expertise of our cooking, you see.

There’s almost nobody here who knows how to make tom yum goong, yes?

The proof of that is in how it took a while until all the ingredients were gone compared to the first day. Everyone was at a loss, not even knowing what to use.

As long as there isn’t a person like Shiina Niki-kun, an expert in cooking, then there’s no chance of anyone perfecting a delicious meal here.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Hiyori smileconfident %}
However, making something absolutely horrendous is out of the question as well, so it’s necessary to make something tasty enough to be eaten.

Even an average taste can get you a passing mark. In other words, it comes naturally to see that the aim of this theme doesn’t lie in the taste, but elsewhere.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mitsuru curious %}
Hm, hm…?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Hiyori smileexplain %}
To be precise, I predict that the contest this time is themed around competing through ‘advertising’ — Marketing your dish!

Publicity has always been an idol’s main line of work. And it’s an idol’s duty to ‘captivate’ the audience by presenting a dish in a delicious manner, no matter what said dish may be, no?

Right. It’s about time I head over to my restaurant.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mitsuru grin %}
Mhm! I learned lots. I’ll also make sure to catch up with Hiyori-senpai ASAP! ♪

<th>(No wonder Hiyori-senpai’s in first place~ I don’t really fully get it, but I can see that he’s thinking about all sortsa things.)</th>
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mitsuru srsthinking %}
<th>(…I gotta figure out how I can reach the right answer with a delicious and captivating advertisement, too…)</th>

{% bubble Chiaki smile %}
T-Thank you very much! I hope to see you again tomorrow!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki sighdrop %}
<th>(I managed to open business today, but the problem is—)</th>

<th>(The tom yum goong I made is so awful, even *I’m* shocked by its taste!)</th>
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki srsthinking %}
<th>(I don’t know what you’re supposed to mix to bring out the sour and spicy flavors, so I tried adding as many ingredients as I could think of.)</th>

<th>(Vinegar, lemon, umeboshi, chili pepper… and I added wasabi too as a subtle seasoning, I think?)</th>
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki sighfrown %}
<th>(I kept straying off course, and the result was this nasty taste. Even my customers make a questionable look and leave as soon as they have one bite of my dish.)</th>

I feel bad doing this on behalf of the producers of these ingredients, but I can’t really serve this soup anymore, can I…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki sightired %}
Uuu… To think I’d face an outcome even more disastrous than the first day…

What are you going to do now, Morisawa Chiaki!? You have to come up with a way to recover from this!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki sad2 %}
…However, I’ve already used up all my ingredients. And even if I made a new batch of tom yum goong now, I still have no clue what I’m supposed to put in one…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki norsmile3 %}
Welcome~ I was actually thinking of closing up shop already—
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki curious %}
Huh? It’s you, Anzu. Have you come to judge the screening?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki awkward %}
My restaurant’s dish? Ah, no, I’d feel awful to have you eat that. It wasn’t really something edible, you see…

You’ve got such a grand role as the judge, so you can’t risk getting an upset stomach here. I won’t have the heart to face your parents, either.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki shocked %}
……You didn’t come to eat a meal? What do you mean…?
{% endbubble %}

<div class="msr-narration">
    <p>Screen transitions to a different area in Gourmet District</p>

{% bubble Hiyori grin %}
“Welcome, come on over! I, Tomoe Hiyori, will gladly introduce my restaurant to you all!”

“Look, look! ♪ This here is my shop. Today’s special is tom yum goong!”

“M~m, this rich shrimp soup has <em>such</em> an invigorating aroma that seeps into my nose… The special tom yum goong full of Tomoe Hiyori’s love simply cannot get any more spectacular than this…☆”

“You’d be missing out on most of your life if you went home without even having tried this! Such terrible weather!”
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki surprised %}
Ooh, this is…!

There’s a commercial being filmed, just like Anzu said. I had no idea about any of this!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki curious %}
…It became well-known through the broadcast? Mrmm, it seems I was so focused on cooking that I completely missed it.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki srsthinking %}
If I want to use my dish for an advertisement, I’d have to prepare a fresh bowl of soup. But the thing is, I’ve already used up all my ingredients.

This was entirely my mistake. It’s frustrating, but I have no choice but to give up on participating in the commercial shoot.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki norsmile %}
Anzu, thank you for letting me know. I have to look ahead and make use of this reflection for the next time.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki awkward %}
Haha, I actually wanted to show a cool side here, but… It doesn’t always work out that way so easily, huh?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mitsuru grin %}
Ne~chaaaaan!! I’m dashing right over to you, so wait a little!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki shocked %}
Woah, Tenma-kun!? Are you here to film a commercial too?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mitsuru smileconfident %}
Mhm! I rushed to get everything ready! C’mon, Raika-chan, you join me!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Raika curious %}
Huh? Me too?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mitsuru fist %}
“To all the viewers, hello! I’m the greatest super star, Tenma Mitsuru! And—!”
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Raika smilesoft %}
“Hawawa. I’m a newcomer idol — My name is Hojo Raika…!”
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mitsuru grin %}
“I’ve come here to tell you all the fun going down at this 4piece audition!”

“We’re at Gourmet District. All the idols here are competing with restaurants. Including me, and I’m having a whole buncha fun by making bread and stuff!”

“Everyone who’s watching us on TV can’t experience the taste of our meals, right? That’s why I’ll show you the charms of this audition for as long as I can~☆”

“Raika-chan’s super good at singing. He can pull customers over just by singing…!”

*<th>(Whispering)</th>* C’mon, Raika-chan! Sing!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Raika smile %}
“♪\~♪\~♪”
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mitsuru grin %}
“Wahaha, isn’t he super duper good at singing? And of course, everyone else’s performances are top notch, too!”
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Raika awkward %}
“I excel at singin’, but I’m completely useless at anythin’ else…!”
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mitsuru %}
“Mhm. It’s only natural for each idol to have their own specialty.”
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mitsuru frown %}
“And see, my dish today was a complete failure too! I couldn’t figure out what a tom-myagonmu is in the end, not even how it’s supposed to look, y’know?”
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mitsuru smileconfident %}
“But! Even if I fail to cook a dish, even if I struggle to properly present who I am — I’m always doing my absolute best in hopes of bringing smiles to everyone watching on TV!”

“So I’d love you all to watch over our challenges ‘til the very end!”
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mitsuru niyaclosed %}
“4piece is the only place you’ll ever get to see this much radiance from so many idols~!”
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki surprised %}
O-Oohh…!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki norsmile3 %}
<th>(I think this might not be the sort of commercial the program had in mind, but — I can sense Tenma-kun’s wholehearted enjoyment of this audition even from here.)</th>
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mitsuru smilesoft %}
Whew\~ I managed to make it on time by dashing over here! Ne\~chan, thanks for telling me about the commercial!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki curious %}
Tenma-kun, Hojo-kun. Are you sure you’ll be alright not advertising your restaurant?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mitsuru %}
Huh? My restaurant’s already closed for today. Since I couldn’t make tomyanmugom in the end… Raika-chan’s the same as me, too.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Raika sightired %}
A-Aye. I was also unable to accomplish anythin’…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mitsuru smileexplain %}
That’s why I’m switching gears and going all out in hyping up this audition! Everyone looks all gloomy ‘cuz they couldn’t make the dish today, right?

I’m sure the people watching on TV won’t feel happy either if they see everyone looking like that.

Like, my fans always tell me, “when Mitsuru-kun shows his energetic self, I start to feel energetic, too,” soo~!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mitsuru fist %}
When I decided to join this audition, I got support from a whole buncha people. That’s why, in return, I wanna show my energetic self to everyone!

Even if my dish was a failure, it’s a super star’s destiny to hype up the audition with a smile and lots of fun! ♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Raika grin %}
Wah~! Mitsuru-oniisan, you’re so cool! Not to mention, you even allowed me to join the commercial with you…!

My tomyamgun was a complete failure. I don’t even know if I’ll be able to cook somethin’ tomorrow either.

But still, I feel like I learned what’s important as an idol from Mitsuru-oniisan…♪

    <p>Next day, in the Gourmet District kitchen. Today’s theme: “Egg dishes”…</p>
</div>

{% bubble Raika fist %}
—I did it! If we’re talkin’ about egg dishes, then it just has to be fried eggs~♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mitsuru %}
Raika-chan, you went with fried eggs? I went with tamagoyaki omelet, we’re so similar![^21]
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Raika %}
Tamagoyaki omelet!? You truly are amazing, Mitsuru-oniisan. I can’t properly roll the egg at all…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mitsuru %}
Ahaha. I can’t roll it properly either, y’know? But it’s sweet and tasty, so it’s no problem-o!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mitsuru curious %}
And Chia-chan-senpai went with…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki smilesoft %}
Mm, I haven’t finished cooking mine yet!

Besides, this is a serious contest, so — Don’t mind me, I’d prefer you two go and sell your egg dishes to your hearts’ content!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mitsuru grin %}
Got it! Same to you, Chia-chan-senpai, you’ve got this~!

Yeah, you know it! ☆

<th>(Considering I even missed my chance to be part of the commercial contest yesterday, I haven’t made a single notable accomplishment in this audition so far.)</th>

<th>(That’s why I want to <em>absolutely</em> make sure I achieve good results in today’s “egg dish”…!)</th>
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki serious %}
<th>(Thankfully, I secured what I needed in the scramble for ingredients earlier. However—)</th>
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki sighdrop %}
Am I really going to go with Chinese fried rice *again!?* You’ve got such a measly amount of food you can make on your own, me…![^22]

<th>(There aren’t any striking characteristics in fried rice. If I don’t add something that could work as a ‘selling point’, then achieving success here will be beyond my wildest dreams.)</th>

<th>(I could go with tamagoyaki omelet as I know how to make it, but… That would just be the same as Tenma-kun, and it’s far too questionable as an accompaniment to fried rice!)</th>

Woah—!? So it was you, Sakuma — Don’t whisper in my ear!

{% bubble Ritsu smilesoft %}
You get spooked way too easily, Moririn~ You had such a grave look on your face, so I was wondering what was wrong.

And so, here, for you. It’s free service from me…♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki smile %}
Isn’t this… my favorite food, french fries!?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Ritsu smileexplain %}
I was thinking of handing it out to any customers lining up. Especially since Hiyohiyo was the cream of the crop as first place yesterday, yeah?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki curious %}
Huh? Didn’t you finish making your tom yum goong?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Ritsu frown2 %}
Ah\~… I couldn’t be bothered to advertise for a dish I barely made right. Hiyohiyo’s pretty bold in that sense, don’t you think\~
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Ritsu snicker %}
Even if it doesn’t taste like anything special, he’s capable of showing it off as if it’s the most worthwhile dish with the finest quality ever…♪

It’s no wonder he became the billboard for restoring the declining Tomoe Foundation.[^23] Maybe it’s something like a difference in resolve?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Ritsu norsmile %}
What about you, Moririn? Did you completely give up on the contest? I thought you were pretty eager about it at first, though.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki sad2 %}
No, that’s not…

…………
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Ritsu smileconfident %}
Well, you might be surprised to find out how fun it is to be part of the ‘enjoying ourselves group’, y’know? Not that we know where Mayomayo went, though.

I should also prepare to open my restaurant, so. See ya~♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki norsmile %}
Y-Yeah… See you.

Welcome! Come on over and try some freshly-made piping hot food at my restaurant~!

“Gladly”…? Ooh, thank you very much!

Right then, I’ll make the tenshindon fried rice straight away![^24] Please feel free to wait in your seat!

<th>(Alright! I’m managing to attract interest from customers…!)</th>

<th>(By making tenshindon omelet too instead of just fried rice on its own, it should elevate the feeling of an egg dish.)</th>

Thank you for waiting! Here’s Morisawa Chiaki’s hot-blooded tenshindon fried rice. Please savor the food to your heart’s content!

Ah! I’ll clear your plates. If it’s alright, I’d love to hear your thoughts on the taste…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki srsthinking %}
Hm. “There weren’t enough things to eat, so it didn’t really feel filling. I’d love it if there was more crab in the dish”, is it?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki smile %}
I’ll take that as reference! Thank you very much!

<th>(It’s also crucial that I do the best that I can to obtain a higher rating by taking the customer’s opinions into account as much as possible!)</th>
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki sighfrown %}
That being said; more crab, huh… I’m not too sure if I’ll be able to remain profitable if I add more crab per meal, but I just have to try and take on every challenge without fear of the risk.

{% bubble Chiaki fist %}
It’s still too soon to give up, Morisawa Chiaki!

There should still be a chance for recovery from here! Raise your voice, and keep attracting more customers…☆
