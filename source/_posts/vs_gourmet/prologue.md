{% bubble Mitsuru worried %}
Dash, dash, dash~! I’m late!

<th>(I dunno what I’m gonna do…! Today’s the start of ‘4piece’, the audition I’ve been waiting for day and night!)</th>

<th>(I even asked for the impossible from Tomo-chan and the others if we could have our schedule changed, ‘cuz I wanted to join the audition that badly!)</th>

<th>(But I got so excited about it last night that I couldn’t sleep properly, and ended up oversleeping!)</th>

<th>(I left the dorms at the very last second ‘cuz of that!)</th>
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mitsuru sighdrop %}
<th>(If I’m not there at the venue, they’ll be able to tell that I’m late… And everyone in Ra*bits will get angry with me, too!)</th>
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mitsuru angry %}
If I run as fast as I can, I should make it just in time! I’ll keep dashing super duper hard ‘til I reach the 4piece venue!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Raika unknown %}
…—ce.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mitsuru curious %}
…Mm? Did I just hear a weird sound?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mitsuru shocked %}
Wait, I don’t have the time for that! I gotta get to the venue fast~!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Raika unknown %}
…piece…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mitsuru surprised %}
Huh!? What the, this is so spooky! There’s nobody around me, but I hear a voice!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Raika unknown %}
Down… Down here.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mitsuru curious %}
Down?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Raika worried %}
‘Scuse me, sir… You said “4piece” just now, right?

Would it be alright if ya take me to the venue with ya, please…?[^1]
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mitsuru surprised %}
Woah—!? There’s someone collapsed in the bushes…!?

You okay? Are you hurt anywhere?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Raika awkward %}
Ehihi… I’m ashamed to admit that I haven’t eaten anythin’ in days…

I have an acquaintance in 4piece, so I tried walkin’ there in hopes of receivin’ his blessin’, but… I collapsed midway from the unbearable hunger, it seems.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Raika sightired %}
I think I may starve to death at this rate, so… I beg you, may you please take me to 4p—<em><th>(stomach growls)</th></em>
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mitsuru srsthinking %}
Erm, ermm…?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mitsuru %}
I didn’t really get it, but I <em>did</em> get the part where your belly’s growling for food!

I’ve got anpan bread with me![^2] I save it for emergencies! I’ll give it to you!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Raika shocked %}
Huh!? Are ya sure…!?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Raika nod2 %}
Ehihi. Onii-san’s treatin’ me so generously even though I’m a stranger… That’s so awfully kind of ya~♪[^3]
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Raika curious %}
…………
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mitsuru idle %}
Huh? You froze up with the bag in your hands… What’s wrong?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Raika sighdrop %}
Uu… I’m so hungry that I don’t even have the strength to open the packagin’…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mitsuru grin %}
Oh what, that’s no problem-o then! I’ll just open it for you!

‘Kay, here you go~♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Raika nod %}
Ooh…! Ya even kindly opened it for me!? Goodness me, I’ve truly only been gettin’ saved by kind people ever since I left the “facility”!

I can’t thank ya enough! A whole bunch of thank you…♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Raika sad4 %}
<em><th>(Nom, nom, nom)</th></em>… *Cough, cough!*
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mitsuru surprised %}
Woah— You’ll choke if you eat it all in one go!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mitsuru %}
I’ll tear some bit by bit and feed it to you, so take your time gulping it down~♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Raika grin %}
<em><th>(Nom, nom)</th></em>…♪ Ahh, it’s so sweet and tasty!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mitsuru grin %}
Ahaha. Feeding you like this looks as though I’m giving you pet food~♪

Heh-heh. I’ve also got a milk carton with me~♪ I’ll put the straw in so you can drink it right away!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Raika cryalmost %}
Uu—! You’re far too kind! Why’re ya bein’ this generous to me even though I’m just a stranger, Onii-san?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mitsuru smileconfident %}
That’s ‘cuz it’s only natural to help someone in trouble! I could never do something as cruel as ignoring someone collapsed on the ground!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Raika nod %}
Goodness, pardon me for not realizin’ sooner! I’m deeply impressed by your thoughtfulness, Onii-san.

I’ll never forget the debt I owe ya for the rest of my life! I assure ya I’ll have it in my mind, aaalways and forever!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mitsuru %}
Nah, don’t worry about it at all!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mitsuru idle %}
…By the way. You said you left a “facility”…? But have you actually been getting by okay?

It’s kinda worrying that you were passed out on the side of the road, like… Kinda makes me anxious?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Raika %}
Oh, no, no, there’s no need to worry about me!

Onii-san, ya said you’re on your way to 4piece, right?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mitsuru %}
Mhm! What about that?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Raika %}
The truth is, I was also on my way to the 4piece venue in order to meet my acquaintance.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Raika awkward %}
But I completely forgot the path to the venue… so I was hopin’ someone could take me there.

I’m as light as a bird, so I can confidently keep up when someone’s runnin’!

And it must be fate somehow that we met here, so… If you could please take me there as a guide…!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mitsuru %}
Okay! Then you can count on me!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mitsuru curious %}
<th>(…Huh, if he knows someone there, does that mean he’s also part of the showbiz?)</th>

<th>(Maybe he’s the child of someone participating in 4piece? I sometimes see people who work as idols with their kids around.)</th>
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mitsuru srsthinking %}
<th>(That would explain why he was in a “facility”, too~ That kinda work keeps a person busy all the time, so he might’ve been kept in custody somewhere?)</th>
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Raika curious %}
…Onii-san?

What’s wrong? Could it be that Onii-san forgot the way there too…?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mitsuru shocked %}
Ah—! I got caught up in my thoughts! I almost forgot that I’m late to the audition!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mitsuru %}
I’m Tenma Mitsuru! What’s your name?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Raika norsmile %}
My name is Hojo Raika. I’m a newcomer who came here just recently.

I don’t really know much about this area, but with someone like Onii-san around, I can rest at ease~♪

Please do take care of me, Mitsuru-oniisan~♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mitsuru grin %}
‘Course, Raika-chan! It also feels reassuring for me to have someone come with me to the venue~! ☆

But we gotta dash, dash right now, or we’ll be late!

We might be disqualified from 4piece if we don’t make it in time~!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Raika fist %}
Understood, Mitsuru-oniisan!

I absolutely want to repay ya for the debt I owe ya…!

## Translation Notes

[^1]: Raika uses <em>setsu</em> (拙) as his first-person pronoun. He speaks in a very old speech pattern from the Edo period (<em>de-yansu, de-gozee-yasu, shi-yasu</em>). People who spoke this way were of the ordinary working class. It’s a polite way of speaking, but it’s also overly humble; the speaker puts themselves down while respecting others. His first-person pronoun also gives that same over-humble impression. Please check <a href="https://enstarsmasterlist.github.io/featureidol" target="_blank">this masterlist</a> for a translation of Raika’s Idol Story 1 & 2.
[^2]: Anpan is bread roll filled with red bean paste. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anpan" target="_blank">Read more here</a>.
[^3]: Onii-san is “big brother”. Other than its usage within family, it’s also used to show respect towards a stranger or an older person. It can also be used to refer to someone who feels like or is regarded as an older brother figure.
