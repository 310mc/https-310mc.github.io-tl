    <p>A short while later…</p>

{% bubble Akiomi idle %}
—We’ve finished tidying up the kitchen, and all the participants have exited the area.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Jin %}
Great work. We’ve also finished seeing off all the fans~
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Nice %}
Now then. Let’s get straight to it — It’s time to assess the second venue, Gourmet District.

Just like the first venue, Prince Castle, I’d like to start by grading the ‘competition score’.
{% endbubble %}

{% img https://f005.backblazeb2.com/file/reitoouji/ro_zH66c0738dJ4mhV2.webp?timestamp=1723888529702 %}

{% bubble Seiya %}
The screening of the second venue, Gourmet District, was a ‘Restaurant Management Competition’, correct?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Akiomi idle %}
Indeed. This document summarizes the participants’ final profit.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Seiya %}
Oh my, this is… Ahaha, a much more awful outcome than anticipated, isn’t it?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Jin smile %}
Whoa, whoa, everyone’s almost in the red. The hell were they doing this whole week…?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Nice northinking %}
…Quite strange, as I do recall Tomoe-kun and Sakuma-kun earning a steady profit throughout the week.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Akiomi frown2 %}
Most of the participants were likely overly enthusiastic about their fans visiting on the final day.

And for the fans’ sake, Tomoe-kun ignored the costs of serving food with high quality ingredients, which brought all his earned profits back to square one.

The same goes for Sakuma-kun. Not only did he ignore the costs, but he decided to make intricate sweets that took a long time to reach the customers’ tables.

And so, because his ratio of served customers was inadequate, it seems his profit ended up nearing the red.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Nice norsmile %}
So this outcome is due to prioritizing the fans’ satisfaction over profit. From an idol’s standpoint, however, I suppose it could be said that it was a Nice approach.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Seiya yare %}
Nevertheless, it’s conduct that ignored the objective of Gourmet District. Perhaps their ‘individual score’ will be different, but it will be difficult to award them a high rating on their ‘competition score’.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Jin frown %}
I’m gonna put this harshly: It’s ‘cause being an idol is more than just thinking about the fans.

There’s also the agency’s wishes, or the job’s request… It’s crucial to properly fulfill what you’re asked for, too. After all, you’d be too much to handle if you’re out of control.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Jin curious %}
On that note, those who steadily earned profit are… Oh, this is surprising. It’s Tenma and Ayase.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Akiomi idle %}
While the other idols were making merry on the final day, Tenma-kun made a sale out of serving bread that doesn’t cost much to make.

Whether it was calculated or purely coincidental is hard to judge… But an outcome is an outcome.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Akiomi frown %}
On the other hand, Ayase barely participated in the actual competition, and made profit through all the vegetables he harvested, so I’m not quite sure what to even say to that…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Seiya smile %}
In his case, in exchange for his ‘individual score’, his evaluation became centered around his ‘competition score’. Fufu, what an interesting kid…♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Nice smileconfident %}
I honestly never thought we’d get to see the idol’s individuality shine, even in areas like that.

This was a completely unforeseeable conclusion, but that in of itself was quite Nice!

Anyhow. Let’s award each participant their ‘competition score’ based on this assessment.

Now then. Next up is the ‘individual score’ review.

Throughout Gourmet District’s screening, many idols truly displayed a battle that used their own ‘individuality’ and ‘values’ as weapons.

I ask you all once more. In Gourmet District, were there any idols you particularly thought had a special, unique charm to them?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Jin norsmile %}
Alright, I think I’ll start first.

Well, I say that, but I’m going by the same evaluation standard as Prince Castle, really. I personally nominate Tenma.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Akiomi idle %}
It’s rare to see you take the initiative to speak first. Is that just how impressionable the idols’ efforts were to you…?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Jin smile %}
Yeah. He’s the only one who had a different point of view about Gourmet District; one that wasn’t restricted to its setup, right?

Take his commercial for example. He’s the only one who tried to liven up the 4piece program itself, instead of his own restaurant.

He didn’t do it to win — He just wanted to entertain the viewers watching the program.

The outcome of that is shown through the number of fans on the final day. To be frank, I don’t think we would’ve had so many customers coming if it weren’t for him hyping up the show.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Nice nod %}
Mhm, mhm. His “Rice Curry Bread” was also spectacular!

His unbelievably fantastic creativity, and the lack of hesitation to take action… I felt the aura of a star in his daring nature.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Akiomi norsmile2 %}
As for me, I give a high appraisal for Morisawa-kun, who made incredible efforts in Gourmet District.

That child always made sure to bring happiness to the person directly in front of him, no matter the disadvantageous situation he fell into.

He didn’t give up even in the most hopeless situation — Moreover, I’m sure there are many viewers who were touched by the way he inspired everyone around him, and fought to the very end.

He’s an idol you simply can’t hold back the urge to love and cheer for… I believe that Morisawa-kun has that sort of charm concealed within him.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Nice smileconfident %}
Fufu. ♪ I also consider that part about him deserving of an exceedingly high rating.

How about you, Seiya-san? Could you let us know your thoughts?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Seiya smileexplain %}
Hmm, let’s see… Then, I shall nominate two people, Hiyori-kun and Ritsu-kun.

The two of them hauled Gourmet District to their favor from the first day until the sixth day.

They recognized their strengths as an idol, and made constant use of them in their strategies. We can’t allow ourselves to miss that, no?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Nice smilesoft %}
Tomoe-kun is one of the idols I particularly rate highly, as well. Although, it’s from a bit of a different point of view from Seiya-san.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Seiya %}
What makes you rate him highly then, Nice-kun?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Nice winknice %}
His conduct while cooking was exceedingly beautiful! It was Very Nice…☆
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Akiomi curious %}
H-Hah… What sort of influence does that have on the screening?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Nice smile %}
Fufu. I could tell that Tomoe-kun deliberately conducted himself in a manner overflowing with a beautiful, refined air, you see.

The way he’d work with the pot… The way he’d cut with the knife… No matter the moment, no matter the angle, he would radiate his own glimmer as an idol.

I’m sure all of that was reflected in his performance abilities, as well.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Akiomi serious %}
Hm… In other words, it’s your own personal point of view that makes you hold a high evaluation.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Seiya %}
How about you, Anzu-san? Was there any idol that got your attention?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Seiya smilesoft2 %}
Fufu, Raika-kun? Indeed, he was a participant who clearly recognized his own strength.

Although he didn’t take any action to make practical use of that strength like Hiyori-kun and Ritsu-kun did, he earnestly and persistently performed his singing specialty.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Nice %}
Mm. And in fact, Hojo-kun’s singing indeed attracted many of the fans and gourmands. It was a coincidence that I encountered him, but I’m glad to have scouted him. ♪

However… I can’t look past constant rule breaking. He seemed to have reflected on himself by the end, but we’ll have to take those violations into account all the same.

How about the other judges? Which idol do you believe are worthy of a high rating—

—Hm. Morisawa-kun, Tenma-kun, Tomoe-kun, and Sakuma-kun — It seems like the four of them are an even competition between each other.

Tomoe-kun and Sakuma-kun, who earned profit by amply exhibiting their strengths…

Morisawa-kun and Tenma-kun, who aimed for a turning of tables while livening up the show…

There’s no doubt that all four of them will be recognized for their extremely evenly matched accomplishments and incredible efforts.

Following after the first venue, the second venue was also an absolutely spectacular screening to witness.

—Right. The second venue’s assessment ends here.

For the ‘individual score’ grading, just like the first venue, I’d like each of you to grade them responsibly, based on everything we’ve discussed.
{% endbubble %}

<div class="msr-narration">
    <p>Time passes…</p>
</div>

{% bubble Nice smileconfident %}
Now then, if we’ve finished the scoring, then it’s time we head to the next final screening.

The participants of the third venue, Soukei Pagoda, await us!

Ahh, how I would love every one of you to show us your radiance more closely…

There is no need to fear. You only need to demonstrate your abilities as your true self.

For you see, all I want to do is deliver that brilliance of yours to the whole entire world…♪
