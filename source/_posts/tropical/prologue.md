    <p>One year after ES’s establishment, in April. During a Ryuseitai meeting…</p>

{% bubble Tetora idle %}
I’ve got somethin’ important to talk about with all of you.

We’ve gotten through all the jobs that were sent to RB, so I’d like to appoint a new commander for the upcoming R2.[^1]
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora smile %}
I’d like the next commander to be… Midori-kun!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori worried %}
Ehhh…? <em>Me</em>…?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata v2 %}
clap, clap…☆ *<th>(claps)</th>*

congratulations, midori~♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki smile3 %}
Mhm, and great work coming from you, Nagumo.

Now that you’ve appointed a new commander, we’ll be changing from “RB” to “RG,” Ryuseitai Green.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shinobu v2 %}
Heheh, I cannot wait to be next so that I may lead “RY”!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori frown %}
Erm, I’m aware that we‘ve decided to take turns being the leader of Ryuseitai…

I mean, the leadership stuff was the whole reason things got tense in our unit, so I’m not against it…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori frustrated %}
But this is way too sudden, y’know…!? I’m not mentally prepared at all!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora idle %}
Huh? You don’t want it this way?

Since we decided to take turns with bein’ the commander from now on, I thought it’d be good if we made it so that one leader appoints the next one.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori sigh5 %}
Um, won’t that be unfair…? It’s no different from having no place to refuse, and it’ll <em>definitely</em> lead to someone getting the leader spot more often than another.

Besides, we’ve barely decided on other things we should be doing.

Like, how long should one of us stay as the commander? What do we do when the commander has clashing views from the other members? We’ve barely settled on anything properly except based on vibes.

So I dunno, making me the one to go next is just a lot on me…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki nod %}
Hahaha, Takamine, you’ve got so many thoughts to share with us, y’know? I feel like that’s exactly why Nagumo chose you as the next in line.

You’ve never truly had an opportunity to stand out in the center, so if anything, I think that having you as our next commander would certainly demonstrate to the world that Ryuseitai has powered up. I feel like it’s a great opportunity!

Nagumo’s vision of a hero came to life through RB. If we were to follow in his footsteps, our unique traits will be able to shine even brighter within Ryuseitai.

Mhm, it’ll be just like the hero alliance, the Avengers…!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora sigh %}
His speech sounded good ‘til he added the last bit…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora serious %}
Anyways, so… Midori-kun, you’d rather not take the role for now, right?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori sad %}
Yeah… I know I was bound to take on the role at one point, but…

There’s just no way I can be the second in line, y’know… That’s just way too much responsibility to bear after Tetora-kun… I mean, he was even the commander of Ryuseitai-N…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora smile3 %}
Aw c’mon, it’s not <em>that</em> big’a deal…♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori worried %}
Um, I wasn’t saying that to compliment you, though…?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki awkward %}
I see… I think I let myself get a little too excited. Sorry, that was hasty of me.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki smile3 %}
I’m just so happy that Ryuseitai has turned over a new leaf. I know all the troubles we’ve gone through are my fault, but I’m just so excited about our new system.

And the fact of the matter is, Nagumo’s RB created a huge buzz. Not only was it new ground for us Ryuseitai, but it garnered a great reputation and news coverage.

I felt as though our gears were all spinning together perfectly at last, and it allowed us to witness a scenery like never before.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata smile %}
it was a one-of-a-kind [live show] for us, wasn’t it?

it was a lot of fun performing as a ryuseitai with a dark charm~♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shinobu v2 %}
Indeed! Not to mention, our fans also welcomed the new Ryuseitai image color with open arms. I truly understand how Morisawa-dono and Shinkai-dono feel!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora v2 %}
Well, I think it was well-accepted partly ‘cuz RB is real different from the usual Ryuseitai. I guess it’s the charm of seein’ a different side to a unit.

That’s why I wanted to appoint Midori-kun as the next leader, since he’s the complete opposite of me… But if he can’t do it, I guess I’ll go with someone else…?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki fist %}
I’m always prepared to take the position! ☆
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori frown %}
No, you’re better off as a regular member for a while. Do you have any idea how long you’ve been the leader…?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora curious %}
That leaves Shinkai-senpai or Shinobu-kun…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata idle %}
mm~ for the sake of our future, i [feel] as though it is not a good idea to decide on the leader without proper [reason].

you would not want to be chosen just because you are the [only one left] either, would you, shinobu?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shinobu srsthinking %}
Me? Mm… Indeed, I would not. I would rather await my turn as the commander. It <em>is</em> a rank that has been treasured dearly for a long time, after all.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori yare %}
Yeah, well, that very same rank has unfortunately been turned into a rotation-based system…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki %}
No, that just means that it has that much significance.

The commander position isn’t something to push on someone for no discernable reason.

Of course, I do think everyone here has the capability to become one themselves.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki frown %}
In hindsight… When we told the public that Ryuseitai split into “M” and “N”, I should have also declared that every one of us has the ability to become a leader…

But I was so caught up by the hero tradition, that I never once considered it at the time. I need to learn to do better…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata frown2 %}
chiaki always wants to [learn] to do [better]~… it is honestly a bother.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki surprised2 %}
Wha—!? Where did I go wrong, Kanata!?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata frown2 %}
do you see what i mean…?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora srsthinking %}
What now then…? We can’t leave the spot empty, so I wanna decide on <em>someone</em> through some method.

Is there any way we can go ‘bout this that could satisfy us all?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori idle %}
Hmm… Well, I know it’s important to have a reason and convention to go about it, but I feel like we’ll feel trapped that way.

Most of us still haven’t experienced being a leader, so I think I’d be way more glad with a lighter way of doing it…

I think deciding who’s next based on a game is a casual enough way to go about it while we’re still adjusting to this system.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora v2 %}
Ohh, so you intentionally wanna decide more casually for now, huh?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shinobu v2 %}
How about we decide based on a lottery, then? It would be fair that way, and I feel as though we would all be in agreement!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata v2 %}
lottery~ i like that idea.

i am sure that none of us would like to stop this steady flow for ryuseitai right now, so i think that each of us feels a bit [unsure] if we are suitable for the role.

so let’s decide on who is next through [lottery], and [settle] on that~♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki fist %}
Alright then, leave it to me! I’ll use this white board we brought, and these color magnets… *<th>(Scribbles on the board)</th>*

And done! I’ve set up a ladder lottery to decide who will be the next leader!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora idle %}
…? There’s only four draws…? Not five?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki %}
Yeah, because you’ve already done a great job commanding us in RB. The rest of us should be the ones trying for the position of the next commander, right?

So, could I ask you to draw the lines for us after everyone’s chosen a spot in the ladder, Nagumo? That way, the next commander will inherit your resolve!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora fist %}
Aight! I’ll be the one in charge of it then!

So, which are you guys choosin’?
