## Chapter 1

<div class="msr-location">
    <p><span><b>Location:</b> Tropical Live Stage</span></p>
</div>

<div class="msr-narration">
    <p>Time passes, around the middle of April…</p>
</div>

{% bubble Kanata v2 %}
heey, midori~?

please come over here~ we can have a [quick look] at how the venue looks like~♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori smile5 %}
Wow, it’s practically a full house… I can see a lot of people carrying the collab merch between us and “Tropical Island Troppeys”.

Their hiatus meant no new merchandising, but thanks to this live show, they were able to make new merch to sell… Just that alone makes this project worthwhile.

…Ah! That person is holding a super rare uchiwa fan…![^1] Those were only given out during the screening premiere of the cartoon…!

I wonder if this means there are “Tropical Island Troppeys” fans in the audience, too… Were they also sad when they first heard about the hiatus…?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata norsmile %}
everything has to come to an [end], isn’t that right?

but that [end] is why we are here — because you love [tropical island troppeys], yes?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori smile6 %}
…Yeah, I do. I’m not confident enough to proudly say I created an outstanding project, but… As the leader, and as part of Ryuseitai, I’ve done everything I can to the absolute maximum.

It’s kinda emotional to have your very own planned performance come to life, huh?

Everything about Tropical Live was decided by my authority as the leader — from the outfits, to the staging…

And I definitely wouldn’t have been able to make this performance a reality if it weren’t for Anzu-san.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shinobu v2 %}
Oh, Shinkai-dono, Midori-kun! I see that you two finished preparing early.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora curious %}
I heard you guys mention Anzu-Anego; is there trouble somewhere or somethin’?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki v2 %}
Anzu will be watching over us from backstage. If there’s anything you need to tell her, you should go now while we still have the time.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori norsmile %}
Ah, I’m fine. I just thought I should thank her later for coming up with this incredible project—

‘Cause she led me all the way here, after I was so heartbroken by the hiatus announcement.

Anyway, I see we’re all here. We’re gonna do a joint live with “Tropical Island Troppeys”.

Working together with the mascots I used to adore as a kid is like a dream come true to me.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata v2 %}
hello, [armajiro]\~♪ today, you and i will dance together\~

round\~ round\~ yes\~? ♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori nod %}
Shinkai-senpai’s already conversing so openly with them. He really is Ryuseitai’s perfect model of a mascot~
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora surprised %}
<em>Conversing</em>…? It just looks like a wooden plank to me, though?

I can understand if this were a stuffed toy or a costumed character, but it’s kinda weird to make friendly talk with a wooden <em>plank</em>…?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori worried %}
You don’t get it at all… These illustrations of “Tropical Island Troppeys” were their first official designs, y’know?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori fist %}
Plushies and stuff are cute too, but using the original designs really suits this final collaboration…!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shinobu curious %}
“Tropical Island Troppeys” truly have a deep history… There is still quite a lot we could learn about them, isn’t there?

But I’m certain that there is a deeper meaning to our encounter with them. I will try to learn more about mascot characters through this job.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki v2 %}
Yeah, we need to show various forms of Ryuseitai from now on, so I should deepen my understanding, too.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki idle %}
By the way, Takamine, I have a question…

Yuruseitai seems to have kept a lot of Ryuseitai’s elements in mind, hasn’t it?

I was expecting something much more mascot-like for the stage, but… was this also what you had in mind from the start?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori yare %}
Where were you looking, Morisawa-senpai? I only told you guys to relax and take it easy; I never once said anything about becoming a mascot character…?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori smile6 %}
We may be “Yuruseitai,” but we’re still also “Ryuseitai”.

And I knew it’d be cruel to show our audience something disappointing — especially when they came for us, for Ryuseitai.

Of course, we’re still going for a new look we’ve never shown our fans on stage before, but it’s also important to include the main thing that defines us.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki smileconfident %}
I see. So all along, you cherished my likes, too.

I’m fired up now! I’ll do my absolute best to ensure I convey your likes to the whole venue…!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori grin %}
Ahaha. Sure, but if you start to stiffen up again, I’ll get angry, okay…? ♪

…Ah, it’s about time for our performance.

We have special guests with us today, so we need to make sure all the “Tropical Island Troppeys” fans enjoy our performance, too.

But all of you went along with all my unreasonable demands, so I’m sure we’ll do just fine.

Let’s all enjoy ourselves until the very last minute — In a soft, cheerful, exciting way!
{% endbubble %}

## Chapter 2

{% bubble Midori smileconfident %}
“Hello, everyone! Thank you for coming to our Tropical Live!”

“We Ryuseitai have powered up to a new form, where we express each of our unique selves.”

“Last time, we were RB, led by Tetora-kun — This time, we’re Yuruseitai, led by me.”

“What’s more, we won’t be performing alone — Our friends from ‘Tropical Island Troppeys’ have rushed to join our side!”

“The residents of this tropical island — Bearbonk, Mr. Slothy, Armajiro, Kiwi, and Plateypus — are all here to dance with us!”
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori smile6 %}
“At first, I was so shocked when I heard that they’d be taking a hiatus, that I felt too heartbroken to do anything… but that doesn’t mean that they’ll be gone forever.”

“They’ll continue to enjoy their days on the tropical island, and then pop up on a whim to emotionally heal us whenever we’re sad or exhausted.”

“Those were always the sort of warm memories — the warm light that ‘Tropical Island Troppeys’ had given our hearts.”

“That’s why we Ryuseitai asked them to perform with us, so that we can repay their kindness.”

“So I hope you’ll also continue to carve their heroic form and their tropical island festivities in your hearts.”

“♪\~♪\~♪”
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora smile2 %}
<th>(Haha, even though he said he was real nervous to do the openin’ speech, Midori-kun’s actually managing it just fine on stage~)</th>

<th>(I was already impressed that Midori-kun didn’t cower back from bein’ the leader, but for him to be <em>this</em> confident… His love for mascot characters really goes far, huh?)</th>

<th>(Let’s dance together, Bearbonk. We gotta follow after Midori-kun…♪)</th>

“♪\~♪\~♪”

<th>(You did incredible work, Takamine. You truly give off the aura of a commander.)</th>
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki awkward %}
<th>(But… Haha, it’s sort of a bizarre sight to dance alongside mascot characters.)</th>

<th>(There are likely some fans who’re confused by how different this atmosphere is from the Ryuseitai that was led by me.)</th>

<th>(Even when RB was booming, there were a few people who expressed thoughts like that…)</th>
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki smilesoft2 %}
<th>(But personally, I’m very much enjoying the current Ryuseitai.)</th>

<th>(Our unit had been pushed around by problems called by adults, yet now, the four of them get to do whatever they like. How could I ever be against that? ♪)</th>

“……♪”
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shinobu v2 %}
<th>(Heh, my art of transformation worked like a charm!)</th>
{% endbubble %}

{% img /img/es/eventstory/tropical/shinobubcg.jpg %}

{% bubble Shinobu v2 %}
<th>(The fans are all enjoying our collaboration with “Tropical Island Troppeys”.)</th>

<th>(First RB, and now Yuruseitai — My comrades are all beaming out a beautiful radiance. That makes me unbelievably happy.)</th>

<th>(I’m looking forward to the day that I become the commander, and am able to explore a form of Ryuseitai that defines me.)</th>

<th>(Because I know that all my precious comrades here will walk alongside me on that fateful day…☆)</th>

“♪\~♪\~”
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata smilesoft2 %}
<th>(fufu, i see that everyone is enjoying themselves~)</th>

<th>(i cannot help myself from having fun now, either~♪)</th>

<th>(we went through many [ups] and [downs] until we completely changed [form] in ryuseitai, but… those [hardships] are what strengthened everyone.)</th>

<th>(i am excited for the day that i am [commander], but i am even more excited to see everyone’s [growth].)</th>
{% endbubble %}

{% img /img/es/eventstory/tropical/kanatabcg.jpg %}

{% bubble Kanata v2 %}
<th>(i am sure that once this [powered up] ryuseitai becomes the [norm] for us, we will grow [stronger] than ever before.)</th>

<th>(let’s continue to go forward as [best] as we [can], with anticipation of what is to come. because this is the dawn of a new ryuseitai…☆)</th>

“tropical island troppeys, i will also heal everyone alongside you~♪”

“…puka! ♪”[^2]
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori smile5 %}
<th>(…Wow, everyone’s shining so bright.)</th>

<th>(They’re all so cool — singing and dancing with everything they’ve got, all for the sake of my ideal vision.)</th>

<th>(Thank you, Ryuseitai. If you guys didn’t help me, I would’ve never been able to make this performance happen.)</th>

<th>(When I was suddenly appointed the commander, I honestly didn’t think I could do it.)</th>

<th>(But now I get it… It’s really such a blessing to have everyone in Ryuseitai support your dreams, isn’t it?)</th>
{% endbubble %}

{% img /img/es/eventstory/tropical/midoribcg.jpg %}

{% bubble Midori grin %}
“Thank you for listening to our song. But our live show has only just begun!”

“Please sit back, and enjoy our performance in a soft, cheerful way…☆”

    <p>A few days after Tropical Live…</p>
</div>

{% bubble Midori sigh %}
Ahh, I’m so depressed…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki grin %}
You seem to have surpassed your limits during Tropical Live, Takamine. But it’ll be alright! Now that you’ve conquered your duties as commander, you can definitely do anything!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori sigh %}
Please don’t try to beat a corpse back to life…

<em>Sigh</em>… I didn’t expect us to have <em>this</em> much work to do after the live…

I’m burnt out from so much paperwork… to the point that I need you guys to help me out with all of it. I feel awful…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori curious %}
Man, you’re even more amazing than I thought, Tetora-kun… Did you also have to do all of this when we were RB?

It’s only just now making me realize that there’s a lot an idol has to check through — like recordings, performance reports, and so much more…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora v2 %}
Oh, yeah, but I didn’t really struggle much.

I coulda left all the checkups to the agency staff, but since RB was established for specific reasons, I made sure to look over all the reports in case there were any inaccuracies.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori sad2 %}
You really are a sportsy guy through and through… The total opposite of me.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shinobu awkward %}
Erm, aren’t you in the Basketball Club, Midori-kun…?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shinobu v2 %}
Nevertheless, I believe that it’s good to split these tasks between everyone.

I have become proficient at office tasks thanks to being part of the Student Council, so you are completely free to ask me for help.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori nod %}
Thanks, Shinobu-kun. Your kindness warms my heart…♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata northinking %}
one of the difficult parts of being an [idol] is that we cannot stay [soft] and [relaxed] forever, yes~?

i really understand why you admire [mascot characters] so much, midori.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori sigh4 %}
I know right… Why do we have to live such busy lives as part of society…?
{% endbubble %}

<div class="msr-narration">
    <p>Sound of footsteps</p>
</div>

{% bubble Midori norsmile %}
Ah, hello, Anzu-san.

Thank you so much for the other day. It’s because of you that the Tropical Live went off without a hitch.

I owe our success to you, Anzu-san, for guiding me when I was down in the dumps. Thank you so much, really.

Ahaha, I can’t fully enjoy the victory just yet, though, ‘cause I still have to get through all the post-performance checkups. But I’m really glad we got to do it…♪

Hm? That’s exactly what you came to speak to me about?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori blushshocked %}
A letter… Wait— Is this from “Tropical Island Troppeys”…!?

Wow, are you serious…? They wrote a message with an illustration just for <em>me</em>…?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shinobu v2 %}
Ooh, these are new illustrations!

They went through all this effort just for us… They are truly refined~♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora fist %}
Your love got through to ‘em, huh, Midori-kun?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki grin %}
Ooh, and there’s even a mascot company who watched our live show, and has sent a request for us to collaborate with their mascot…?

This is wonderful news, Takamine. Your likes seems to have brought us new encounters~♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata grin %}
it is a blessing to have new [work] come about, isn’t it~?

shall we take the offer? …though of course, it will be with midori as the [commander]~♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori smile6 %}
…Okay. To be honest, I don’t know if I’m up to the standards of such a huge role, but…

I’ll continue devoting myself to my likes, and show the world the hero form that best defines me.

After all, *I’m* the one and only commander of Yuruseitai.
