Healing jungle is calling you!
(Come on!)
Healing jungle is calling you!
(Come on!)
Healing jungle is calling you!
(Come on!)

“Come on over to paradise~”
“Let’s go together~!”

It was an encounter out of nowhere
(yu~ru~ru~)
Stumbling on soft-looking characters one day
(yu~ru~ru~)
The carefree-looking
(yu~ru~ru~)
Animals spoke to me!
(Hi!)

“hey there~”
“no need to look so depressed”
“let’s take it easy together~”

If you want to break away from stress-town
Then join our adventure, it’s all about
hunting for
healing!
You, too, should
“Relax~!”

Ahh! (Ah!) Paradise (Yeah!)
Softness is always so nice! (So nice!)
It’s so fluffy and warm! (Yeah!)
It always
(Always!)
Wraps around
(Hug me!)
Our hearts so gently (Yes!)

That’s right! (Oh!) We call that “favorite”! (Yeah!)
It’s time to go searching for yours (With me!)
It’ll heal you!
(Heal!)
Where we’re headed
(Anywhere!)
We’re undefeatable!
(Oh yeah!)
There were never any enemies to defeat here
in the first place, anyway!

“In this jungle, where all our favorite things are gathered,
We’re connected to all kinds of people… That’s why—”

Hey, about your special thing,
Won’t you tell us what it is?
We’d love to know!
Because hearing it always
Gives courage
(Yeah!)
To our hearts

“One day, I encountered my “favorite” thing!”
That’s why—
“Come on over to paradise, let’s go together!”

Ahh! (Ah!) Paradise (Yeah!)
Anything goes here! (Anything!)
It’s because everyone is different that it’s interesting! (Yeah!)

The design
(We’re all)
and balance
(different!)
Are best when it looks half-hearted and unclear! (Yes!)
Now! (Ah!) You, too (With love!) Should join us! (With us!)
Let’s be happy together! (Happy!)

Our feelings
(Me too!)
Empathize with one another
(Our minds!)
And support each other’s hearts
So let’s meet at the relaxing jungle\~\~\~\~\~! (Roaaar\~)

(Welcome Paradise!)

Healing jungle is calling you! (Come on!) x3

“Come on over to paradise, let’s go together~!”
