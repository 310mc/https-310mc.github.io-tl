Anzu! You're working until late at night again, aren't you? ☆

…Hm? You dropped something!

This… is a marriage application form!? You're going to get married, Anzu!?

            Oh, it came as an extra with a bridal magazine you bought as reference…?

            It was such an unexpected thing to find on the floor, so I accidentally jumped to the wrong conclusion! I'm sorry!

            There was a similar scene in a drama I played an act in, so it reminded me of it!

Speaking of marriage… Tenshouin asked me to come see him a moment ago…

Then he told me that the PV for a bridal company that I shot with Sazanami got cancelled in the end.

It's a shame, but there's nothing we can do about it… The actual problem here is that we've now decided to plan a PV project from scratch. I'm not sure where to go from here…

            Heheh, your help would always be reassuring.

            But I'll juggle ideas with Sazanami first. He might have a few ideas of his own.

            No, actually… I still haven't thought up anything.

            I plan to talk to Sazanami about it once I head back to the dorms. I'd like to go through all the documents for the project again and come up with some ideas before that.

            That's true, but the theme is bridal, y'know? I don't even know where to begin to think up ideas!

            Oh, I know! Is it alright if I borrow your magazine later?

Oh! I got so into our conversation…

It's quite late in the night by now, so take care on your way home, alright?

I'll head back to the agency office to take my belongings.
