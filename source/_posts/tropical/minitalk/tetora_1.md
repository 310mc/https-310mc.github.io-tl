Hello, Anzu-Anego! Thank you for all your hard work! Are you gonna eat lunch now?

The other seat is empty, so you're totally free to sit here~♪

{% bubble Tetora awkward %}
Ah— It's bad manners to look at my phone while eatin', right… Sorry, I'll put it back in.

            I was reading through a TV entertainer's interview.

            There's somethin' I wanna study up on, so I was using it as reference.

            That's true! We should focus on our food when it's time to eat, after all.

            We dunno who's watchin', so I wanna be careful with my manners at all times.

            Ahaha, yep, you're right, I'm usually way more careful.

            I'm pretty hungry after finishing my work, but there was also somethin' I was real curious to look up… so I couldn't help myself.

I was filming for a TV show just a second ago, and one of the entertainers was late, so it caused a bit of tension…

But the host calmed the situation down in a peaceful way, and things went back to normal.

I was honestly amazed, 'cuz I could never do that. That's why I thought to learn more from 'em by checking out their interviews.

<div class="minitalk" character="Anzu">
    <div class="minitalk-option">

            Sounds like a lovely host.

        <div class="minitalk-option_content">
            {% bubble Tetora v2 %}
            At first, I thought, "Is it really okay for things to be this lax with the host…?"

            But their ability to change the atmosphere of the room in a flash is incredible. I can really learn a lot from people who've been in the show biz for a long time.

            It's nothin' big really, especially compared to other people, like Morisawa-senpai.

            I'm real clumsy, so I wanna try to absorb as much reference points as I can.

            Mascot character… as in, the ones Midori-kun likes?

            Oh yeah, since mascots also heal people in a peaceful way, right? Maybe I should learn from 'em, too.

Lately, RB has been gettin' a lotta attention, so I've been getting a lot more jobs, like the one I just mentioned.

I've been appearing on magazines, radios and a lot more… It's a real good reminder that each media has a different vibe to it.

I gotta study more and more to be capable of handling any kinda work!
