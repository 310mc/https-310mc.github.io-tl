Oh! Anzu! Perfect timing. I'd like to give you throat lozenge!

After I finished recording a radio show, the staff handed some to me.

You have to talk to people a lot, right? Then you should take good care of your health, including your throat!

            The one I gave you is pineapple flavor! There are other flavors too, like strawberry, orange, grape, and so many more! ☆

            You're free to pick any flavor you like! You can even take as many as you like, too~♪

I was recording for a radio talk about tokusatsu shows. They invite people who worked on shows to chat about it.

Today's guest was the explosion-effects director, an extremely vital role in a tokusatsu show! We talked for so long, that I didn't even realize we were almost running out of time…!

Of course, we managed to make it in time in the end, but it's really hard to hold myself back whenever it's a topic I enjoy! ♪

            Oh, if you're interested, please give it a listen! It's broadcasting at around this hour every week.

            We're even collecting letters from listeners, so you're free to send one of your own! ☆

            That's one of the many duties I have to fulfill, after all! I wanted to hear more from the director, but sticking to the radio's timing and setup is much more important, or all our efforts would go to waste!

            Being a professional is all about taking responsibility when accomplishing your tasks, right?

            Heheh, you may be quiet sometimes, but you also have an enthusiastic spirit hidden inside of you, don't you?

            I know you're busy, but I'd love it if we could take our time and talk to about idols sometime.

For the tokusatsu radio, they told me, "Go all out with your love for tokusatsu!"

That's why they're letting me host it however I like, and it's a lot of fun.

I don't always get an opportunity to work this freely, so I'm really grateful to all the staff members.

            Yeah! I got to convey to everyone what I love, and have them be excited to see more from me. It's truly a blessing.

            I have to keep working hard and growing further in order to continue meeting their expectations!
