(I heard that my next job will be an interview with entertainers… The interview'll happen while walking down the streets of the shopping district…)

(But that means there'll be a lot of new faces to meet, and an interview on the streets has such high expectations… Am I really gonna manage it…?)

*Sigh*… I'm so depressed…

            Ahh, Anzu-san. Good day to you…

            I'm just a little depressed 'cause I have to do a job I'm not really used to… Could you hear me out a little, if that's okay?

            The truth is, I have to do a street interview… I'm not too used to this sort of thing, so I can't help but sigh every second I breathe…

            Ah, hello. You must have so much on your plate, but you still always seem to be having fun, Anzu-san…

            I feel like you probably don't get depressed whenever you're up against something you're not used to, or in places you've never worked at before… I need to learn from you.

{% bubble Midori frown %}
I've gotten used to doing solo work, but there are times when I wish I had everyone from Ryuseitai around.

Especially with work where I have to meet new faces, like the job that's coming up…

Anzu-san, what do you make sure to do whenever you're working with someone for the first time?

            Woah, that's insanely hard to do…!

            Can I really manage that…? I feel like my very existence would disappear if I ever tried to really read the room…

            Start by learning more about the person, huh…

            This would be a lot easier to do if I was better at talking to people I'm meeting for the first time, but… I'll still try my best.

I'm so glad I got to ask you, Anzu-san. I feel like it really came in handy.

Where am I gonna have the street interview…? Ahh, I think it'll be in the neighboring shopping district.

…You go there sometimes? Huh, really… I haven't gone there before.

            Oh, they have a well-established sweets store, huh? I'd like to go there.
