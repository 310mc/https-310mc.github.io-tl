<th><em>(sways left and right)</em></th> Soooftly, soooftly… Take it easy and relaaax~…♪

Woah!? Anzu!? Don't tell me you saw me…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki awkward %}
You don't have to look so worried, I'm alright! I was just doing a final warmup to see if I can manage soft-like movements just fine!

            Mhm! It's hard to move softly and slowly unless you get your body used to it first.

            That's why I was warming up before the live show starts, so I can ensure I'm maintaining a soft-like posture.

            Oh, is that so…? You looked really anxious, though…

            You just weren't used to seeing me that way… Ah, I see now. Then I hope you can get used to my softness through this performance~♪

            Yeah, I thought I may surprise you if I did that in front of you, so I came to the venue much earlier, but…

            As always, you arrive ahead of time to the job, Anzu. I expect nothing less from an excellent producer!

{% bubble Chiaki awkward %}
I'm not that good at moving and expressing myself in a soft way, it seems…

Takamine couldn't bear to watch my performance, so he introduced me to a yuruchara that resembles me.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki v2 %}
It's an octopus yuruchara that wants to be a police officer. Despite its earnest, fiery choice of words, it moves in a droopy, adorable way.
{% endbubble %}

<div class="minitalk" character="Anzu">
    <div class="minitalk-option">
        <div class="minitalk-option_header">
            You're starting to talk slower.

            {% bubble Chiaki v2 %}
            Really? I didn't even notice…

            Maybe learning from this yuruchara has naturally started to make me resemble it!

            {% bubble Chiaki nod %}
            Isn't it? Honestly, I didn't expect to get this attached to it, but…

            Takamine introduced me to this yuruchara just for my sake. Just that thought alone makes it look all the more adorable to me.

            Oh, a teacher…! I like that! I should call this yuruchara my teacher from now on!
            {% endbubble %}
            {% bubble Chiaki frown %}
            Ah, but… Takamine might scold me and warn me not to give it my own nickname…[^1]

{% bubble Chiaki fist %}
Oh! The rest of the members are about to arrive soon.

While I hadn't expected you to spot me do my final warmups… Now that I've finished warming up, I'm in perfect shape to show off all the softness Takamine hammered into me to the maximum!

It's time to let aside being cool and fiery, and instead perform in a fun, cheerful, and super soft way~♪

            Yeah, I'm also excited for you to witness Ryuseitai under Takamine's lead!

            I'm sure you have a lot of work as a producer, but still, I hope you can watch over us until the very end! ☆

            {% bubble Chiaki v2 %}
            Yeah, of course I will! Ah, but I can't go <em>too</em> hard, or I'll become fired up again.

            I'll keep my heart ablaze as always, while still making sure to be as soft and fluffy as possible for the whole performance~♪
