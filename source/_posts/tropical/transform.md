    <p>A while later…</p>
</div>

{% bubble Midori smile6 %}
—Alright, that’s all for the Mascot Character Course. Thank you for listening…♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shinobu v2 %}
Ooh… The course was incredibly in-depth!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora srsthinking %}
They’ve got cartoons all over the country, huh~? I had no idea.

I always knew I had different interests from Midori-kun and stuff, but it’s pretty hard to wrap my head ‘round everythin’ now that I’m learning all ‘bout it.

Mascot characters should have a surreal look to ‘em, like their design is kinda vague and incomplete… They should be fun, cheerful, and soft… That’s the path that you advocate for, right, Midori-kun?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori smile4 %}
No, no, that’s such a stiff way to look at it. Calling it a “path” isn’t soft and fluffy at all, y’know?

Don’t try to pick up the keywords; I’d rather you feel it through your heart. You need to relax and have fun.

Ah, to be clear, what you just mentioned is pretty much the general definition of mascot characters, and I personally really like the sloppy-looking mascots, but…

The “Tropical Island Troppeys” characters we’ll be collaborating with are <em>only</em> soft and cute, so that might make things easier for you guys.[^1]
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora frustrated %}
Hmm, this sounds harder than I thought… I don’t think we can approach this with the usual methods.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora norsmile %}
But I’m real glad you gave an outline of everythin’ in a single 2-hour course. It was short enough for me to focus on the lecture.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata smile %}
yes~ i am also [new] to mascot characters, but it was easy to understand.

it seems like it will be tricky to convey it as ryuseitai, but i would like to do my best and try.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori frown %}
Yeah, that’s the actual problem…

I’m struggling with that part, too. If we were to take it too seriously and fully go for a mascot-like energy — I feel like it would actually just ruin the fluffy atmosphere…

And I tend to push myself to perform as properly as possible, which honestly doesn’t feel soft and fluffy at all…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki norsmile %}
I think it’s fine to work as hard as you possibly can, though.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori curious %}
…?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki smile3 %}
While super sentai shows are said to be aimed at children, the creators behind it are always working as best as they can to make an interesting show.

In fact, it’s <em>because</em> it’s intended for children that they can’t cut corners. It’s that sort of fighting spirit that drives them to perform at their best.

So I think it’s perfectly fine for you to perform as hard as you possibly can, as a mascot character.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori glare %}
Um, mascots and sentai heroes are entirely different things, though…?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki surprised0 %}
Wh—…!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki worried %}
Well, um, you’re right about that, but…! What I mean to say is, you don’t need to hold back with us… You’re welcome to go full force with me!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata norsmile %}
chiaki may say that, but you are free to do it [however] you like, midori, okay?

if you are still not sure how to go about [yuruseitai], then take your time thinking about it.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shinobu v2 %}
This is a wonderful opportunity for you, so there is no need to push yourself to forge ahead if you are still unsure how to proceed.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori sad2 %}
Mmm… Maybe somewhere deep inside, I’m still holding back a little…

After all, what I love isn’t necessarily what other people love.

Maybe I’m too scared to push my likes onto others… It’s one thing if it were just you guys, since we know each other well, but… this is a project we’ll show to even our fans, so…

Honestly, I think this concept is different from what they’re hoping to see from Ryuseitai, and I’m scared of the possibility of us splitting apart all ‘cause of what I love…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata smile3 %}
it will be okay, midori.

each and every one of us love ryuseitai. isn’t our love the same as yours?

all of our [fans] love ryuseitai, too. they will surely accept the things we [enjoy].

    <p>Later that night…</p>
</div>

{% bubble Midori curious %}
Anzu-san? What’re you doing here so late at night…?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori blushshocked %}
Huh!? “Tropical Island Troppeys” agreed to collab with us…!?

They’ll perform with us in the live show!? Ahh, I’m so glad…!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori smile %}
Thank you. But you didn’t have to come all the way to the dorms just to tell me that, y’know?

Ah, you wanted to see my excitement…?

Ahaha, to express my thanks, I’d be more than happy to show you that~♪

You made my wish come true, after all. I can’t thank you enough.

Ah, that reminds me — I have something I’d like to speak to you about, is that alright?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori srsthinking %}
Everyone in Ryuseitai is doing the best they can to understand my love for mascot characters.

But I can’t help but worry if I’m actually properly taking on the responsibilities of a leader…

They’re pretty optimistic about the project, but every time I think I might fail, it scares me enough to make me hesitate…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori frown %}
If only I had a bit more confidence… If I could just lead Ryuseitai the same way Morisawa-senpai and Tetora-kun did, maybe I wouldn’t need to worry…

But as soon as it’s on me to teach everyone what to do, I start to feel like I’m not capable to lead them…

I’m sorry, I’m sure this is just a bother to you… I’m forcing you to listen to a depressing vent about how pathetically weak I am…

Ugh, I can’t stand myself… I just wanna disappear…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori curious %}
…Huh? The company behind “Tropical Island Troppeys” were super happy?

Why’s that? I didn’t even do anything… *They’re* the ones who’ve always given <em>me</em> so much comfort.

Ah, so at first, they were going to decline the offer to collab if it was just to take advantage of the fact that they’re going on hiatus…?

But when they saw my love for mascots, and the performance of the newly formed Ryuseitai, they decided to accept the offer…? Because they felt like they may be able to breathe new air into the group…?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori smile5 %}
Wow, really…? So “Tropical Island Troppeys” wanted something new to try out, too…

That makes sense — After all, their history goes way back… and they’d always be printed on all the merchandising of the company.

They were cherished by their company, but at the same time, it meant they didn’t do any collaborations with other mascots or events.

So they ended up handing the spotlight over to new mascot characters, and became one with the past.

That might be why they saw us Ryuseitai in a positive light — Because we weren’t afraid to take on a new look, despite being a long-established unit.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori smile6 %}
Thank you so much for letting me know, Anzu-san.

I may not be very reliable, but now I <em>have</em> to make sure to show a new image color of my own, don’t I?

I can’t cower back now, or I’ll only let Ryuseitai and “Tropical Island Troppeys” down, when they put so much faith in me .
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori fist %}
Alright! I’m going to keep at it with the plan I had in mind!

First, I’ll have all of them meet a mascot. I’ll also give them pointers on how to act like a mascot character — maybe even watch a puppet show that uses plush toys…!

Heheh, there’s been so much happening that I’m not used to, so I kept switching between motivation and depression… It was almost like I was on an emotional rollercoaster ride.

But thanks to you, Anzu-san, I feel like I finally blew all of that anxiety away.

I’ll do my best to meet the expectations of “Tropical Island Troppeys”…♪

    <p>A few days later, on the weekend…</p>
</div>

{% bubble Midori sigh5 %}
It’s almost time for the bonding event… I’m so nervous…!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora awkward %}
I don’t get it, why would you feel nervous? It’s not like we’re the ones up on stage…?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori worried %}
Of <em>course</em> I’d feel nervous…! I’m gonna get to see Pop-dayuu[^2] with my own two eyes, y’know!?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori smile4 %}
Oh, just to let you know, Pop-dayuu is a musical-based mascot character — they wear a kimono and have a music symbol for a face…

And they’ve been trending on social media ‘cause they can even play the shamisen.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shinobu smile %}
Heheh, Midori-kun gets so talkative whenever the topic is about mascots. I can tell just how much you love them!

I feel as though I have a lot to learn from Pop-dayuu. Ninjas are also deeply connected with Japanese culture, after all…♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori awkward %}
Ah, um… Just to be clear, they aren’t <em>that</em> traditional. Though the vagueness of the setting is charming to me, personally…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori smile6 %}
Anyway, we’ve come here so that you can all get a feel of what mascot characters are by bonding with them. So don’t think too hard about it, and just enjoy yourselves.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki norsmile2 %}
Ooh, I read the pamphlet they handed out. It sounds like Pop-dayuu came from a famous shamisen production facility, and traveled a long distance to arrive here.

They host a talk show, perform live music, and then even open a photoshoot session… These sort of resemble the kinds of events you’d find at a hero show.

If I were to think of Pop-dayuu as a hero who works day and night to popularize the shamisen… I feel that I could get very attached to them.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata norsmile %}
chiaki, you always conceptualize everything in [hero] terms, don’t you?

but thinking about things in terms of your own [specialty] might make them easier to learn about.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori sigh5 %}
Mm~ I dunno, it feels a bit off to me… I’m not really fond of comparing it to something else, ‘cause there’s a chance you’ll overlook an important aspect of mascot characters.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori norsmile %}
But, well, I won’t stop you either, so please just enjoy Pop-dayuu’s performance.

Mascot characters are sooo much cuter when you watch them live, instead of just studying about them all day…♪

Ah, they’re here! Pop-dayuu~ Wave over here! *<th>(waves)</th>*
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori blushjoy %}
Waah…! It’s the “Shamisen grip” hand-sign! I can’t believe they’d do their signature pose just like that…! Pop-dayuu is on fire with the fanservice today…!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki nod %}
Takamine looks so happy today. It’s almost unbelievable he was depressed just a few days ago.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori grin %}
Don’t mind me, Morisawa-senpai! Just look at Pop-dayuu!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki smile3 %}
Hahaha, you’re right. Your hero is finally here, after all — It would be rude to have my eyes elsewhere.

Pop-dayuu~!! Wave at me, too! *<th>(waves)</th>*
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori glare %}
Ahh, stop, you’re <em>way</em> too loud…!! The star of this show is Pop-dayuu, y’know!?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora awkward %}
Woah, Midori-kun is dead serious…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora smile3 %}
Aight, I’ll also be sure to cheer for ‘em without raising my voice too much.

Once we figure out how mascots manage to make Midori-kun happy, we’ll be able to make use of it in our Yuruseitai performance.

I’m excited to see your top-class shamisen performance, Pop-dayuu…☆
{% endbubble %}

<div class="msr-narration">
    <p>A while later…</p>
</div>

{% bubble Midori blushjoy %}
<em><th>(clap, clap, clap)</th></em>…☆

Ahhh, that was amazing…! Watching Pop-dayuu perform live is like heaven on earth…!

And now finally, the long-awaited photoshoot session! Let’s all take a photo together!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata nod %}
ooh, [pop-dayuu] is waving at us to come.

i often open photoshoot [events] for a [costumed] character in [aoumi aquarium], but…

having a photoshoot with a [mascot character] i do not know is refreshing to me.

okay, cheese…☆

fufufu~ this photo will surely hold a lovely [memory] for me.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shinobu blushshy %}
Please take a photo with me, too!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shinobu blushjoy %}
Ehehe, thank you, Pop-dayuu! I will make sure to treasure this…☆
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori smile6 %}
Since Shinkai-senpai has a mascot-like side to him, he’s pretty photogenic here. Shinobu-kun’s smile was also really nice in his picture.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori curious %}
As for the other two… Maybe you aren’t soft enough yet.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora sigh %}
You <em>seriously</em> didn’t have to point it out… I’m aware we don’t look that soft.

But since we’re gonna perform as Yuruseitai, I gotta do what I can to understand what it means to be soft.

To be honest, I’m still not sure what we’re aiming for as Yuruseitai~…

But I do sorta get what you mean ‘bout Shinkai-senpai and Shinobu-kun seemin’ mascot-like.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori smile7 %}
…Well, you can leave that part up to me. I’m not sure if my plan will work, but I <em>have</em> thought up a practice session to get ourselves to look more soft and fluffy.

It’s hard to describe what it means to be soft in one word, but…

What we should be going for is something like Shinkai-senpai and Shinobu-kun, who feel cheerful and soothing to look at.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki v2 %}
Cheerful and soothing… Mhm, I see what you’re trying to say.

I’m so glad we came to this bonding event. We not only got to see a mascot character live, but we even had an opportunity to discuss what to do for Yuruseitai.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki fist %}
Right then, Takamine! What do we have to do next?

We’d love to know more! Tell us everything about your love for mascot characters…☆

## Translation Notes

[^1]: As mentioned before, <em>yuruchara</em> typically have bizarre designs. But since Tropical Island Troppeys are not <em>yuruchara</em> designs, they're mainly cute/soft rather than “bizarre” in their cuteness.
[^2]: Pop and <em>tayuu</em> (Refers to an entertainer in kabuki theater and noh plays) were combined together for this mascot's name.
