I’m hungry… It’s a little too early for lunch, but I’ll have something to eat anyway.

<th>(Hrmm… It’s pretty empty around this hour, I didn’t know that. I can’t really calm down in a crowded place, since it’s always so noisy… I’m glad I found out about this.)</th>

<th>(Usually most meals are sold out if you’re a second too late, but it seems like I can choose any of them right now.)</th>

<th>(So there’s two types of prepared meals today, huh… There’s A for a steak dish and B for cutlet curry rice. You can have a refill of cabbages for A, and rice for B…)</th>

<th>(Hrmm, which to choose…)</th>
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Hajime %}
Takamine-kun, hello~♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
Ah… Shino-kun, are you here for lunch, too?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Hajime %}
I am. I finished work early today, so I tried coming here early, too.

Waah, we can choose whatever we like~

I always freeze up when this place is crowded because it’s hard to order anything, and then the meals sell out before I get my chance to speak. I feel like I’m at an advantage this time~♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
Hehe, you’re reacting the same way I did…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Hajime %}
Really? That’s kinda embarrassing, ehehe… But I’m happy to know we have something in common.

The value meals must be the prepared meals, right? They’re cheap and come with a dessert, so…

Steak or cutlet curry rice… Which to choose, hrmm…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
<th>(He’s stuck on the same choices as me. Yeah, I get you, it’s hard to let go of either…)</th>

<th>(Maybe I should just go ahead and order both…?)</th>

<th>(Both… Ah, I know.)</th>

Um, Shino-kun…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Hajime %}
Yes, what is it?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
Erm… You don’t have to if you don’t want to, but… I’m also stuck on which to choose, and, well… I was wondering if you’re okay with splitting the meals between us?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Hajime %}
Waaah, is that really fine with you!? I would love to~♪

Ehehe. I split meals with Tomoya-kun sometimes, so I’m really happy to know I can do the same with you, too~♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
Ahaha, I didn’t expect you to get so happy about it. I’m so glad I asked…♪

Okay then… I’ll buy the steak dish, and you can buy the cutlet curry rice… Is that okay with you?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Hajime %}
Yes, let’s do it~♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
Time to eat…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Hajime %}
Yes, let’s dig in…♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
<th>(*munch, munch*)</th>… Mm… The steak’s thick and juicy, and tastes even better with rice. I can eat this for years…♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Hajime %}
The cutlet curry is delicious too thanks to the tasty sauce~

Here, Takamine-kun. Say “ahh~” ♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
Huh… Huh!?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Hajime %}
We promised to split the meals, right? C’mon, “ahh~”…♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
Mm… <th>(*munch, munch*)</th>
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Hajime %}
Does it taste good?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
I-It’s tasty, but… I’m kinda confused why I just got fed with an “ahh”…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Hajime %}
Ah—I’m sorry! I have a habit of doing this at home, because I always do it to my siblings…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
I see… Um, you’ll be eating the steak, too, right?

I cut it in half, so… Here you go, I’ll put it on your plate like this…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Hajime %}
Thank you\~♪ <th>(*munch, munch*)</th>… This is delicious too\~

Ehehe, it was a good idea to split our meals.

Takamine-kun, thank you for eating lunch with me.

This cafeteria is quite fancy, so I feel awkward eating in it alone… I’m so glad you were here~♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
<th>(He’s thanking me for something so simple… He really is such a good, proper kid…)</th>

I’m glad I got to see you too, it was just perfect timing… If I were on my own, I wouldn’t have been able to choose, and would’ve just bought both…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Hajime %}
Both!? You can eat that much!?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
I did a lot of work this morning that used up most of my energy, so I was *really* hungry… I think I would’ve been able to eat both if I tried.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Hajime %}
I-I see. I’m sure it would have been impossible for me… But I suppose I should also try harder to eat more, so I can grow big…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
You don’t need to push yourself, y’know? Everyone has a certain amount of food their stomach can handle…

Grow big though, huh… I wonder how you’d look if you were bigger…? Maybe you’d go from being a cute idol to a cool idol.

Hrmmm, I can’t imagine it…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Hajime %}
Hehe, it sounds fun to be a cool idol. And in your case, if you were as small as me—

You would’ve been an adorable idol~♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
Mrmm, I wonder… If I was small, I might’ve not been able to continue being an idol, let alone be one in Ryuseitai.

I feel like, heroes look a lot cooler when they’re tall, and, well—

If I don’t at least have some masculinity like Tetora-kun, then I could never manage to compensate for the lack of it with good reflexes, like Shinobu-kun does.

So, I think my current size is just fine…♪
