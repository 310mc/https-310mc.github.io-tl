<th>(What do I do…)</th>

<th>(The new model… Hanamura-san, I think? The work staff told me, “Takamine-kun, as his senior, give him some pointers about this job”…)</th>

<th>(And now it’s been twenty minutes of silence since they’d asked that from me.)</th>

<th>(I-I have to teach him what to do, just like I was told to… Even though I’m not good at that sorta thing, I <em>am</em> still the senior here…)</th>

<th>(But it’s just way too impossible for me. I can barely stand it.)</th>

<th>(This kid is giving off huge “don’t talk to me” vibes… Like, he’s been mumbling to himself here and there while on his phone…)</th>
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori curious %}
<th>(And sometimes he takes selfies and posts them on social media… I think?)</th>

<th>(It’s like he’s making his own world.)</th>
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori sightired %}
<th>(It’s way too scaryy\~… I don’t wannaa\~… I don’t wanna talk to hiim\~…)</th>

<th>(And anyway… This kid heard the staff say that they’re entrusting me to guide him, so I know he’s aware of it.)</th>

<th>(So shouldn’t <em>he</em> be the one to approach me and say, “Please guide me, Senpai!” or something? Isn’t that common etiquette?)</th>
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Fuyume serious %}
……Ah.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori surprised %}
…!? W-What? What’s wrong…?
{% endbubble %}

{% img /img/es/idolstory/initial/fuyume_2_2.jpg %}

{% bubble Fuyume lookingup %}
…They’re calling.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori worried0 %}
<th>(Huh, what? Is he the kind that can hear voices you’re not supposed to hear? Like, someone who hallucinates voices coming from above?)</th>[^2]
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Fuyume norsmile2 %}
It looks like it’s Yume’s turn.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori surprised %}
<th>(Ah— He’s right. The staff are calling for him. The photoshoot’s about to start.)</th>

<th>(What am I gonna do… I didn’t guide him at all.)</th>
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori curious %}
<th>(But from what I’ve heard, this kid is a famous non-professional model…? Like, a cos…player, or something? So…)</th>[^3]

<th>(I don’t really need to give him pointers like some arrogant know-it-all or anything, right?)</th>

<th>(I’m sure he knows how to do this job, right? I mean, he seems to have way too much confidence in himself, so…?)</th>
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Fuyume grin %}
Fu-fu-fu. Yume will do his very best.

Yume will gladly invite everyone into Yume’s world today, too.[^4]

{% bubble Midori sigh %}
<th>(What do I do now…)</th>

<th>(This kid had way too much confidence and pretty much nothing else~…)</th>
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori frown %}
<th>(Like, it’s not that he doesn’t know what he’s doing, but rather — it’s like he’s trying to get through this whole shoot with the way he’d do things in his non-professional modeling days…)</th>

<th>(And I dunno what set him off, but he just kept snapping at one of the staff members throughout the entire session. The moment I thought he went quiet, he suddenly starts cursing like hell at the person, practically denying everything the person stands for, even their humanity—)</th>

<th>(On top of *all that*, he then went on to complain about the lighting’s position, the outfits, and everything else…)</th>

<th>(And instead wore an outfit he brought, demanding the staff to take a good picture of him in the cutest angle…)</th>
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori sightired %}
<th>(Since it was just argument after argument, the photoshoot had to be put to a stop… Then when he realized his point of view won’t do, he started crying.)</th>

<th>(I was told to motivate him by persuading him somehow, but is that even supposed to be my job…? Isn’t that more of a manager’s role or something?)</th>
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori frownshake %}
<th>(Actually, no— If I had taught him how to do this job from the very start, this whole mess probably wouldn’t have happened.)</th>

<th>(I’m also at fault here, so maybe I <em>do</em> have to do something, but…)</th>
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Fuyume serious %}
Midori-sama.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori surprised %}
Huh? Um, what is i—… Wait, “Midori-sama”?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Fuyume grin %}
Yume saw you, right there in a magazine. Yume thought, “so beautiful”, “just like a prince”. Fufu.

So, it’s “Midori-sama”. Because of <em>oujisama</em> — A prince.[^5] Fufufu.

Of course, Yume only has one prince, so you aren’t qualified to be called that—

But there’s no sin to being beautiful, so. Fufufu.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori worried0 %}
<th>(Whaat\~…? What does that meaaan\~…? I dunno what he’s saying at <em>all</em>, are all young kids like this nowadays…?)</th>

<th>(Hey, wait a second— I thought he was sobbing with his face covered, but he actually seems to be doing just fine? Was he fake crying…?)</th>
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Fuyume northinking %}
Melon soda, ume kelp tea, roasted coffee.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori curious %}
…? Huh? What’s that, an incantation?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Fuyume srsthinking %}
What else… There was more in the drink Esu said he found at the end of his adventure…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori awkward %}
I-If you mix all those random things together, you won’t be able to bear the taste of the drink, y’know?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Fuyume hmphleft %}
Yume <em>can</em> drink it. Yume <em>will</em> drink it. He wants to experience Esu’s tale for himself.

Time to drink. <em><th>(Gulp, gulp)</th></em>…

……—   ……
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Fuyume sad4 %}
…………
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori worried %}
Ahh, see, it really <em>did</em> end up tasting awful… You can’t drink something like that. Just the way it looked was bad enough.

Come on, spit it out in this paper cup.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Fuyume saddroop %}
Uuu. Yume is still a novice.

Yume is still, too far from the ideal princess.[^6]

—Sorry, Midori-sama.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori curious %}
Huh, what? I don’t get how we got to an apology…?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Fuyume sad3 %}
Yume did it again. He acted selfish. Because of that, this job isn’t going well, and even Midori-sama got scolded.

That’s why, sorry.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori frown %}
Ah, yeah, well— It’s true that all of it was your faul— I mean, um, I’m also sorry for not teaching you anything, even though I was supposed to…

I failed you as a senior, didn’t I…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Fuyume frownshake %}
It’s fine. Yume believes that, when there’s something he can’t stand — then no matter what Midori-sama could’ve said to him, Yume would’ve felt irritated and ignored Midori-sama.

Yume has always been like this. Always selfish. That’s the only part about Yume that’s like a princess.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Fuyume sad2 %}
But, still. Sorry. The staff member Yume was clashing with is the same person who came to one of Yume’s photography sessions before and acted very arrogant.

They handed out their business card and acted like they were the professional one. It was just the worst; the moment they started leading the place, the atmosphere became awful.

Even though a photography session is Yume’s very own world…

That frustrated and sickened Yume so much, he could never forget it. When he saw that person’s face again, Yume exploded.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Fuyume worried %}
Yume couldn’t stand the thought of being projected in that person’s eyes, being interpreted however they like in their head, as if Yume is their plaything… That’s why, um, sorry.

The truth is, Yume never wanted to trouble Midori-sama.

Yume wanted to get along with you… He wanted to talk to you, but it felt embarrassing and nerve-wracking… Yume didn’t know what to do.

Midori-sama looked like he was in a bad mood, after all. It was very clearly a “don’t talk to me” vibe.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori serious %}
<th>(Ahh—)</th>

<th>(Huh, I see… This kid felt the same way as I did… Yeah, of <em>course</em> he’d feel nervous on his first real professional job.)</th>
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori frown %}
<th>(And I was just like that on my first day at the job, too, so how did I ever think otherwise…)</th>

<th>(Nah, in fact, that’s probably exactly why I was entrusted with this role — ‘Cause they thought I’d understand how this kid feels.)</th>

<th>(I’m really just hopeless. I never, ever grow.)</th>
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori serious %}
Hanamura-san.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Fuyume serious %}
Yes.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori norsmile %}
If you feel a little calmer after drinking something, how about we go and apologize to the staff together?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Fuyume frownshake %}
Don’t wanna apologize.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori awkward %}
Uwah—… Yeah, I get it. Alright, if you want, I could ask if they’d remove the staff member you said you hate from this job.

We have the right to make those sorta requests, at least. We don’t have to do a job we don’t want to do.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Fuyume curious %}
…………
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori idle %}
But if we *don’t* do our job properly, then the other people that Hanamura-san doesn’t hate will be troubled, too.

We’ll be hated by everyone, y’know? Then they’ll be the ones thinking, “I don’t wanna work with those people.”
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Fuyume worried %}
Don’t wanna be hated.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori smilesoft %}
Then let’s make sure to apologize. After we’re done with that, let’s do our job the best that we can.

I know I’m late to this, but I’ll even teach you how to do this job. I’ll properly guide you through it — I’m your senior, after all.

Honestly, it’s a pain, though… I mean, I’m nobody special enough to act like a know-it-all mentor for others, not to mention that I’m not the best at talking.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Fuyume serious %}
Mm… Yume is also not good at it. Yume is just speaking normally, but everyone always looks confused. Strange.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori awkward %}
Oh, you’ve been talking normally this whole time…? You really are just making your own world, huh…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori worried0 %}
<th>(—Wait, crap, I said it out loud. Hanamura-san might get angry. He was probably pampered back in his non-professional world… So he probably loathes being rejected.)</th>
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Fuyume smilesoft2 %}
Fufufu. Thank you, Midori-sama.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori curious %}
<th>(Huh? Eh…? His reaction is surprisingly okay…? I really just don’t get this kid, huh…?)</th>
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Fuyume norsmile2 %}
You know, Yume wants to show off his world to everyone.

And, you recognized that “that” world exists.

That’s why Yume’s happy. So, thank you.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Fuyume grin %}
Fufufufu. Yume kiiind of feels motivated now~ Yume will mend his ways and do his very best. Yume <em>will</em> make sure this job is a success.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori awkward %}
U-Um, sure… I’m glad to know you feel motivated now.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori norsmile %}
I’ll also reflect on myself today and work hard, okay?

Let’s work together to finish this job, Hanamura-san.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Fuyume frown %}
You should say “Yume”, not “Hanamura-san”. That has been irritating Yume this whole time. Yume doesn’t have any motivation anymore.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori worried0 %}
Ehhh…?
{% endbubble %}

## Translation Notes

[^1]: At the start of the second year of ES’s establishment, Midori is a third year in Yumenosaki, which means he’s 17 years old (and he becomes 18 on his birthday).
[^2]: Originally, Midori says “If I were to put it in older terms, a <em>denpa-kei</em>?” More on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denpa" target="_blank">denpa-kei</a> here. As Midori states in the Japanese text, it’s a pretty old-fashioned term.
[^3]: Midori says cosplayer in hiragana instead of katakana (the correct way to spell cosplayer), implying he isn’t very familiar with the term.
[^4]: “Yume” means dream, so it’s a wordplay of his nickname and the word “dream”.
[^5]: “Ouji” means prince, and “-sama” is a polite honorific attached to the word. In fairytales, you typically see the prince referred to as <em>oujisama</em>.
[^6]: Originally, Fuyume says <em>ohimesama</em> for “princess”, which matches with <em>oujisama</em> (prince). In fairytales, you typically see the princess referred to as <em>ohimesama</em>.
