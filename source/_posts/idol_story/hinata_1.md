Hmhmhm~♪

Huh? Woooah— Wazzap, Producer! I hope your work has been going well! *Swish! ☆ <th>(salutes)</th>*

Ahaha~ Yup, I’m copying Vice Prez Saegusa from my agency!

I bet it’d make him happy to see me do this, ‘cause it’d look like I’m getting attached to him~ Though he could just start finding it annoying if I do it *too* much♪

Heh. I’ve been thinking of buttering up to the higher-ups, y’see~

CosPro’s always been our enemy, so it feels a little weird to be with them, y’know?

But! It’s the 2wink way of life to be headstrong and adapt to any type of environment! ♪

We’ll do whatever it takes to make sales~ No matter the cost!

Our work is split between two people, so it’s not a pain for us to go all out with jobs, y’see.

For example, Yuuta-kun’s working hard for today, while I take it easy~

We’re taking breathers whenever we need ‘em, which means our jobs are always top-notch! 2wink is always ready to blast off at full power!

We’re the two-in-one twin idols, Aoi Hinata and Aoi Yuuta!

We’re twin stars who can breeze through the world of showbiz better than anyone else...☆

That’s all, folks! Whoops, I just can’t stop promoting us every chance I get~ I think it’s become a habit of mine...?

Hm? You thought it was great? Thankies!

Weeell, I can’t really do anything with CosPro’s policy of prioritizing the Special Students, sooo~ Us outsiders gotta help ourselves here.

I do wish the agency could promote us instead, though~

Ah, no, I’m not criticizing them or anything.

I dunno about the big guns in the agency, but I know *you’ve* been spreading our name all over, Producer.

And besides, *we’re* the ones who chose to join CosPro, so~ Can’t start complaining now, or we’d only look silly.

It’s not like we’re *not* selling at all anyway, and we’re definitely not struggling either.

Heheh. I’m honestly starting to feel pretty good about joining CosPro.

We’re skilled in all kinda things, and we couldn’t use that to our advantage in Yumenosaki Academy alone ‘cause it only really focuses on live shows.

But CosPro adapts to all sorts of idol activities, plus it’s well-established *and* has a good rep.

There’s all kinds of jobs we can do, from variety shows to acting in movies.

Yup, it’s perfect for “us”! ‘Cause like, if we start picking up every single job we can get our hands on, and put ourselves out there—

2wink’s reputation’ll skyrocket too!

We’ve got *loads* of people who would want us now! ‘Cause clients benefit from idols who can do anything you ask them to do, yeah?

Everyone’ll praise “us”! I can’t stop myself from laughing with joy, *ohohoho~♪*

... In fact, I’m starting to feel like all those opening acts we did for other units last year lasted *way* too long, like a wasted detour...

I mean, I know no sort of experience *really* goes to waste in the end, but...

I wish I could’ve brought Yuuta-kun somewhere where we can shine brightest way sooner, y’know?

It’s all ‘cause I kept running away... Oh, ah-- Um, it’s nothing.

Anyway, Producer, are you free right now? If you’ve got the time, could you teach me about cooking?

Oh, well, I’ve been cooking since way back, so I can pretty much make almost anything...

But I don’t really trust my sense of taste~ I’d always pretended to like the food I hated, so I’ve started to get confused between the two.

Plus, the food you eat for a healthy diet is different from what people like to see on TV shows, right?

I can make stuff super quick and easy, but I dunno if that’s the right answer to what they’d want on a cooking show, sooo~

I’d like to ask for your opinion on things like this, since you’re a producer.

Yup, 2wink’s gonna have a cooking show soon, though we’ll actually be starting the recording next month.

We’d been invited as guests on all kinds of gourmet shows before, so it seems like we’ve got a reputation of being fun to have around.

And ‘cause of that, some higher-up thought up the idea of making a cooking show with us as the main feature!

That’s one of the many good things about CosPro — They immediately start making decisions based on reputation.

Oh, and their ability to make things a reality every time is pretty great, too. So yeah, they’ve been deciding on what to make the show about.

But you work for CosPro too, so you might’ve heard about it already, right?

Yup, they’re working out the details for it right now.

That’s why I’m here at the cafeteria — It’s gotten a lot of good reviews, so I’m trying out everything on the menu.

Oh, by the way; Yuuta-kun’s currently preparing stuff for a different job.

We’ve been splitting the work between us lately, so we can really get things going for 2wink~

Though that means we only get to be together when we’re on the job, which is pretty lonely...

Not only that, but God was cruel enough to put me in a different dorm room from Yuuta-kun...

Uuu~ I’m super deprived of love~ You gotta be nice to me, Producer♪

Ahaha, thank you! So you’ll give me advice on cooking?

The crybaby trick always works, you’re too easy~... Ah, um, just talkin’ to myself!

Hehe, anyway, CosPro makes a clear distinction between every type of role, so~

We can’t really have much of a say in the show’s details, since our role is to be idols.

But we’re called to the meetings for them, so there isn’t any loss to preparing some ideas, is there?

I’m never taking detours ever again. I’m gonna rush straight in through the shortest path possible — and take Yuuta-kun up to the peak of the idol industry.

No—I’ll make sure to take *“us”* there.
