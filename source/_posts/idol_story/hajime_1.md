Hmm\~ hmhmhm\~♪

Little flowers, make sure you grow wonderfully under the lovely sun…♪

…Wah!? H-Hello, Miss Producer!

Did you hear me humming and talking to myself…? How embarrassing~! Ehehe, I can’t help but feel giddy on a day with such lovely weather…♪

Also, we’re actually allowed to enter ES’ floating garden, but we weren’t allowed on the rooftop at Yumenosaki—

So even though it’s perfectly fine for me to be here, I kind of feel like I’m doing something wrong, and I get this rush of excitement… I end up hanging out here a lot.

Uuu~ I’ve shown you an embarrassing hobby of mine.

…Oh! You don’t have to apologize at all! Don’t worry about it~♪

But, yes— Did you have something you wanted to speak to me about?

No? It was just exhausting to be caught up with so much work, so you came here for a breath of fresh air?

I understand\~ Flowers aren’t the only ones who need to bathe in the sun\~♪ We need it sometimes, too\~

Ehehe. Do you plan on having lunch while you’re at it?

Me too~ I was thinking of having my bento here after I finish watering the flowers.

Since we’re both here, anyway, would it be alright if we had lunch together?

…And there *is* something I want to talk to you about, Miss Producer.

Ah, it’s nothing important… Ehehe, well, then, I’ll sit next to you~

Alright, let’s say it together. Thank you for the food…♪

*<th>(munch, munch)</th>* Ah, this is pure bliss~, vegetables grown in spring taste so good. Ah, well, vegetables grown in any season taste good.

But the thawed snow that overcame the cold harsh winter makes the vegetables taste so much sweeter.

And it packs them full of nutrients, as if it's saying, “We hope you can endure this looong, tough season.”

Eating these spring vegetables that have worked their hardest to grow almost makes me feel like I’m doing something wrong, and my heart races… Heheh, I’m just joking~♪

…………

Umm, I can’t just keep chatting away like this, so please let me start talking about something a little more serious. This might just be a misunderstanding, so it’s a little hard to ask…

Erm… Do people feel as though I’m not suitable for Ra*bits…?

Um, no! I suppose I might just be imagining it, but—! Ahh, I shouldn’t be like this— I’m always so prone to worrying…

But lately, I feel like I’ve mostly been doing individual work as myself, rather than as part of Ra*bits…

Or rather, I’ve been getting a lot of jobs that only request me…

Recently, all I’ve been doing is appear in TV shows, especially with that pretty girl idol from my agency, since I’ve interacted with them before.

Ah… As you know, they may be called a “pretty girl idol”, but they’re actually a guy.

It seems like they’re always looking out for me for some reason, and that alone makes me happy, but…

I’ve been getting influenced by their image, so lately I think I’m also being recognized as someone who has feminine looks…

Even magazines have been writing about us, saying: “The hot new topic! The prettiest sisters in the male idol industry!”

Well, of course, I’m very grateful to have my name in the news, no matter what the topic is—

But I’m not a pretty girl, so I feel as though I’m deceiving the whole world… It hurts to think about.

Also, if I’m advertised in that sort of way— Although I can’t say much about Tomoya-kun, since he’s had to dress up as a girl for Drama Club performances…

Mitsuru-kun might feel restricted, and well… He may not be able to properly make the most of his strengths, even though he’s becoming so much cooler recently.

And this kind of development will also make it harder for Ni~chan to return to us, since I think he’s always disliked being called cute.

I just really want to work with those three as Ra*bits again someday…

I’m aware that I’m being selfish… and I’m truly honored to be acknowledged by people, no matter what form of acknowledgement it is.

But, how should I say this, it’s like we’re all slowly falling out of sync with each other… I feel as though we won’t be able to reach the blissful scenery of our dreams, and that terrifies me.

…Ehehe, I’m so sorry for talking about something so strange.

But I wanted to let you know how I’m feeling about this, Miss Producer.

The agency I’m in, Rhylink, was established a long time ago, but it’s been on the decline for so long…

So I’m aware that I can’t get much of a say in how I live in the idol industry.

But there are times when I get tired, or I feel really troubled…

And I’d be really happy if you could notice when those times come, and support me as much as you can.

No — My heart will be saved just by you understanding that I’m in a tough situation, and cheering me on with a “Do your best!”

I’ll be able to work hard just by hearing that. I’ll make sure to do my absolute best, so… Please show me your support, Miss Producer~♪
