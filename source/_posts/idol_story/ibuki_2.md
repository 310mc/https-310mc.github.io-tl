{% bubble Tetora smileconfident %}
<em>Wo-oh, wo-oh~♪</em>
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Hiiro nod %}
We’ve got this~! Karate Club!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora grin %}
<em>Passionately, passionately invigorated~♪</em>
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Hiiro nod %}
<em>That’s the energy that the power of fate gives me~♪</em>
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora sighfrown %}
…I’ve been wondering ‘bout this for a while now, but why’s it become the Karate Club’s tradition to sing my solo while running…[^2] It’s a li’l embarrassing.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Hiiro norsmile %}
Hm. Singing while running is an effective way to build up our lung capacity, you know?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora frown %}
Yeah, that’s true, but it could’ve been any song then, right? So why my solo out of all songs?

Maybe it was just a rare joke from the previous club captain, Taishou…[^3] He sometimes plays dumb with a straight face.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Hiiro smilesoft %}
Fufu. I think there’s charm to it, personally.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora sigh %}
I feel like you and him are a lot alike, Hiiro-kun. You’re also the type to play dumb with a straight face. Plus your hair color is similar to Taishou’s; I’m so jealous—

Meanwhile, I’m still so far from matching his level…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Hiiro angry %}
—Buchou![^4] Watch out!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora surprised0 %}
……!?

<th>(W-W-Wh…*What!?* A rock almost flew straight at me outta nowhere!? Did a rock bounce up while we were running on the sand…?)</th>
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora angry %}
<th>(No— I definitely felt hostility from that.)</th>

<th>(Someone just tried to attack us…!?)</th>
{% endbubble %}

{% img /img/es/idolstory/initial/ibuki_2.jpg %}

{% bubble Ibuki smileconfident %}
Ooh\~, what a nice reaction time\~♪ You’ve got pretty good reflexes, don’tcha\~?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Hiiro serious %}
…Who is this? Do you know him, Buchou?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora curious %}
Nope, I can’t think of anyone I know who’d suddenly throw an attack on m— Or never mind, I can, but… That’d be Taishou, Kanzaki-senpai… or even you, Hiiro-kun, right?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Hiiro norsmile %}
Mhm.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora frown %}
Don’t “mhm” me. I’m not complimenting you. I know I shouldn’t be the one sayin’ this, but why does everyone ‘round here behave like they’re in an action manga…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora serious %}
…Anyway, the point is, I don’t know him. I’ve never seen him before.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Ibuki grin %}
Well, that’s ‘cause it’s our first time meeting each other~. Nyahaha.

I’m Taki Ibuki, born in Okinawa, and grew up in the US.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora serious %}
Okinawa—
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Ibuki smile %}
I was super feared back in my hometown, and was called “Oni”~.[^5] Maybe that’ll make you figure it out?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora idle %}
The one from the vigilante group that defeated the villain known as Crimson Production once upon a time, after the corporation went on a rampage in Okinawa—
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Hiiro curious %}
Huh? Wait, what’s that? What are you talking about?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora idle %}
Just talkin’ to myself. …A while back, Crimson Production was once again overthrown through the efforts of us Ryuseitai—[^6]

But in that corporation, there were also a lotta people who once belonged to a vigilante group.

Are you by any chance here to take revenge on their behalf or somethin’?

I did hear ‘bout the vigilante group’s boss being a man who was called “Oni”. I didn’t think he’d be a young boy, though.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Ibuki smilesoft %}
Well, that’s ‘cause it wasn’t just me, my whole family was called “Oni”\~. The Oni that people feared the most is likely not me, but my grampa\~.[^7]

Also, I wasn’t thinking of taking revenge or anything\~. That’s too old-fashioned for modern times, and it’s apparently forbidden by law nowadays\~.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Hiiro norsmile %}
Hm, is that so? I learned something new.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora awkward0 %}
Hiiro-kun and— Taki-kun, was it? Did the two of you time travel from the Edo era or somethin’?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Ibuki smileconfident %}
Nyahaha. It’s just that you lot’ve got different accepted practices here— Which means, the practices stop being acceptable depending on the era and place~.

You shouldn’t think of yourselves as the standard for everything~, Mr. Japanese?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora serious %}
…If revenge isn’t what you’re here for, then what exactly is it? As you can see, we’re in the middle of training.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Ibuki nod %}
Ah\~, sorry for getting in your way\~. It’s a bad habit of mine\~. I somehow can’t help but try to have my own way with everything.

I can’t really read the room, y’see? Nyahahaha.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora glare %}
…………
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Hiiro serious %}
I don’t think you have to be on your guard, Buchou. I don’t sense animosity from him.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora idle %}
Hmm… Well, if Hiiro-kun says so, then it’s probably true.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Ibuki norsmile %}
No, no, no need to drop your guard! You should stay as you are!

I’m here to test my skills. I’ve been traveling around the place to hone and enhance my combat.

And today, I came to have a match with you, the person who magnificently took down that annoying Crimson Production~♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora curious %}
You’d like to have a duel with me? You say you’ve been traveling around to hone your combat skills… But isn’t that pretty old-fashioned, too?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Ibuki smile %}
Right\~? ♪ I can barely keep up with the cutting-edge stuff, so\~?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora frown %}
But even though we’re in our karate uniforms, we’re actually idols, so we can’t fight in public. We’re in an era where anyone can take a video and spread it on social media, after all.

I’ll get fired immediately if I do anything violent.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Ibuki sigh %}
Things just don’t go the way you want in this world, huh\~… I see\~, that’s a shame.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Ibuki smilesoft %}
Alright, never mind then! Can’t do anything about that, right\~? When in Rome, do as the Romans do! I’ll follow along your way of doing things\~♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora idle %}
…You gave up surprisingly fast.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Ibuki smileconfident %}
It’s just ‘cause I’m not seeking value from physical strength only\~. You said that you’re an idol, and idols shouldn’t engage in any violence— but I’m also an idol who got scouted by Yoshihide the other day\~.

So you and I will have a match as idols~♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora curious %}
Yoshihide? Who’s that?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Ibuki norsmile %}
You don’t know? I thought he was pretty famous, given his position~?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Hiiro serious %}
He’s probably referring to Sanda Yoshihide. His other name is Nice Arneb Thunder.[^8]
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora northinking %}
Ahh~ The person that was a former top idol, and is now known as a producer with remarkable skills. He’s a pretty famous big shot across the world, isn’t he?

You’re acquainted with that person, Taki-kun?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Ibuki nod %}
Mhm. He’s a pretty big guy\~, I feel like I could grow if I were to follow behind him\~.

That’s why I crossed the seas and came to this country. I became an idol under his invitation, too~.

Nyahaha, that means we work in the same industry\~. I hope for your guidance moving forward— My seniors\~♪

As a symbol of our acquaintance, here’s a freshly-fried *sata andagi* for you\~.[^9] It’s peanut butter-flavored ‘cause of my own preferences\~. I’m used to American flavors, you see\~.

Here you go, it’s super tasty~♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora serious %}
Hah… Y-You’re surprisingly pretty friendly, huh…

When I heard that you were called “Oni”, I thought you’d be way scarier.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Hiiro angry %}
…!? Buchou!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora surprised0 %}
……!?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Ibuki smile %}
…Nyahaha\~. What a shame\~. He dodged it\~.

You may have the look of a tamed pet, but your true nature really <em>is</em> that of a beast after all, huh?[^10]

Why, I could’ve sliced your head off if that kick hit.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora angry %}
<th>(This guy…! He tried to throw me off guard so he could catch me by surprise with an upper roundhouse kick!?)</th>

<th>(He’s got insane power…! I only got a li’l grazed, but my cheek looks like it got burned…!)</th>
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Hiiro glare %}
…Did you not just mention how you’re also an idol who shouldn’t engage in violence, <em>and</em> that you wouldn’t take revenge as it’s too old-fashioned?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Ibuki grin %}
Nyahaha, are you mad? You also look pretty tasty~, what a nice glint in your eyes…♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Hiiro angry %}
Answer my question.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora norsmile %}
…Hiiro-kun, I’m alright. You can relax.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Hiiro serious %}
…………
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora glare %}
Taki-kun. If that’s how you’re gonna be, then I’ll take you head-on.

I’m also a man. I’ll always accept any challenge someone throws at me.

Even if those acts aren’t appropriate for idols, I <em>will</em> beat up any villain that hurls sneak attacks at people.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Ibuki smileconfident %}
Mm~… Nah, I’m good. I got a good idea about you by now, anyway.

Nyahaha. You smell of mud like you’re still unrefined, but you’re a straightforward man, aren’tcha\~. I’m sure even the guys at Crimson Production were happy to get taken down by you\~.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora angrycloseup %}
What’re you turning your back on me for— Are you runnin’ away? Just so you know, my flame’s already ignited to the max!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Ibuki smilesoft %}
Of course I’ll run~, I don’t wanna be exterminated just yet, after all.[^11]

So bye-byeee~…♪ *<th>(waves)</th>*
{% endbubble %}

<div class="msr-narration">
    <p>Sound of water splashing</p>
</div>

{% bubble Tetora surprised %}
…!? He jumped into the ocean and started swimming! He’s so fast…!?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Ibuki grin %}
Nyahaha\~. Japan’s number one Momotarō-san; if you wanna exterminate me, then you gotta cross the sea until you reach Onigashima island\~♪[^12]
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Hiiro serious %}
…Hm, I think he’s too fast to catch up to.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora frown %}
Ossu. …The heck <em>was</em> that, seriously…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Hiiro northinking %}
A demon who attacks anyone he passes by, maybe…?[^13] I’m not quite sure, but—
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Hiiro frown %}
It appears that a pretty troublesome person has got their eyes on you, Buchou.
{% endbubble %}

## Translation Notes

[^1]: At the start of the second year of ES’s establishment, Tetora and Hiiro are third years in Yumenosaki.
[^2]: They’re singing Tetora’s second solo, <a href="/unmei_power_energy" target="_blank">Unmei Power Energy!</a>.
[^3]: “Taishou” refers to Kuro, meaning “chief”, “boss”.
[^4]: “Buchou” means club captain/president.
[^5]: “Oni” means ogre or demon. It refers to a type of demon found in Japanese folklore, and it typically looks like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oni" target="_blank">this</a>. The Oni that Ibuki is referring to was first mentioned in <a href="/supervillain" target="_blank">Supervillain</a>.
[^6]: This is referring to <a href="/supervillain" target="_blank">Supervillain</a>, when Tetora was tasked to act as a spy in an agency that was also a criminal organization, and then eventually took down the corporation. The story happens in Okinawa. For more information on what Tetora’s talking about, I recommend reading <a href="/supervillain" target="_blank">the story</a>.
[^7]: Ibuki’s grandpa was talked about in <a href="/stella_maris/hidden_island/#Chapter-10" target="_blank">Stella Maris</a>, hidden island 10. In the same chapter, there is information about Ibuki, so I recommend reading it.
[^8]: A link to Nice Arneb Thunder’s <a href="https://ensemble-stars.fandom.com/wiki/Nice_Arneb_Thunder" target="_blank">Wiki profile</a>. 
[^9]: Sata andagi is Okinawan food that are sweet deep-fried buns. More information <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sata_andagi" target="_blank">here</a>.
[^10]: In this line and the next one, Ibuki doesn’t speak in his typical speech quirk, instead speaking more plainly.
[^11]: Ibuki is referring to what typically happens to onis in Japanese folklores. The oni is exterminated by the folk hero, like in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Momotar%C5%8D" target="_blank">Legend of Momotarō</a>.
[^12]: In the Legend of Momotarō, Momotarō has to go to Onigashima, the Ogre/Oni Island, to defeat the oni. More information <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Momotar%C5%8D" target="_blank">here</a>.
[^13]: Hiiro says <em>toorima</em>, lit. demon who brings misfortune to people it passes by. It can also mean a slasher that attacks people at random.
