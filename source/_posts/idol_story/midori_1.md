Hellooo… This is the greengrocer, I hope you’ve all been doing well~…

<th>(Huh…? There’s nobody around… Maybe I was a little too early… But I’d be late to school if I didn’t come here at around this hour…)</th>

<th>(Well, there’s nobody to scold me for being late, anyway…)</th>

<th>(*Sigh*… I can already imagine my next report card mentioning something about my lifestyle not being proper enough lately…)</th>

<th>(It’s all *his* fault… Thanks to *that* guy constantly spoiling me last year, I got used to that sort of treatment…)</th>

…Woah—?

You surprised me… Hello, good morning, Miss Producer…

I’m sorry, I was in your way by standing at the door, wasn’t I…

I’ll move right away… Huff—Ahh, so heavy!

I haven’t bothered with my body beyond whatever nature gave me, but maybe I should start muscle training along with Tetora-kun and the others…

Hm? Ahh… You probably know this already, but my family owns a greengrocer, right…

That’s why lately, I’ve been bringing vegetables to this building, as well… ES was the name I think…

It’s a huge hassle… This place’s far from home…

I mean, I appreciate the cafeteria for buying so many, but carrying them is a major pain…

And then I feel extremely exhausted straight from the morning, and start yawning all day… Well, okay, I was always the type to do that, but…

Ahhh, jeez… This is too draining, ugh—I don’t wanna do this anymore… I’m so depressed, I wanna die…

Woah—! Ahh no, you don’t have to help me carry these…

I appreciate the thought, but I don’t think I should let a woman do the lifting…

I may be saying how depressed I am and all, but I just have a habit of saying that, so don’t worry…

I’d only be a failure of a hero if I keep letting others help me…

Actually… I know I’m late in asking, but why *are* you here so early in the morning?

Don’t you have school, too…?

Huh, I see… So it’s part of the Producer Course’s curriculum to adjust class times to your jobs, so you’ve got school off on a weekday…?

Your course sorta sounds like a pain…

Well, I guess it’s harsh in the Idol Course, too—We have to study during the day, and then go to work after classes…

Huh, I guess it’s rough all around… I only joined the Idol Course by accident, but…

I’m sure I would’ve been sighing about how depressed I was no matter what I went into…

If that’s the case… I won’t bother with a re-do when I’m this far into my course, and it would be unforgivable on the behalf of everyone who’s helped me anyway, so…

I’ve just gotta do what I can with what I have now.

Hehe. I’ve finally gotten used to life as an idol student, and, well…

I’m definitely not as overwhelmed as I was when I first joined the course, so don’t worry about me…

Well… I’ve still got a whole bunch of worries, though…

Just the other day, there was some news about a “*super handsome greengrocer guy!*”, and now I’m getting more jobs related to my looks…

But man, I’m already having to deal with taking over the greengrocer, ‘cause my dad’s health has declined…

Honestly, I feel like I’m holding vegetables way more often than a microphone…

Like, I’m having more jobs to do relating to supporting food businesses and other farmhouses… Stuff related to partnerships, and all…

I mean, I’m glad to know that even someone like me could be of use to people, but…

Lately, my “greengrocer guy” side is way more obvious than the fact that I’m a hero or an idol…

Like, I won’t be someone protecting the world, but a protector of vegetables and fields…

My parents would be happy, but, I dunno… I feel like no matter what I do, or how hard I try turning things around…

I’ll always go back to just being a greengrocer guy, huh…

I feel like I haven’t been able to move one bit since I was born, and it’s making me kinda anxious…

But, honestly… I dunno what I wanna be, or even what I *can* be… I only have a vague idea…

I’ve always just gone with the flow, so I don’t really have a clear idea of what my dream is…

It’s only a coincidence I became an idol, too… And I only became a hero because there was someone who wanted me to…

That’s why… I feel like I haven’t really been walking with my own feet…

I’m just in the same place as I was when I was first born—within a cabbage.

Ah—No, it’s not that I think babies are born from cabbages…

My parents tricked me into thinking that when I was young, but I know better now, really…

Uh—I suppose this isn’t the topic to talk to with a woman, or it’d just sound like sexual harassment… Uuu~ I’m sorry.

Actually, I’m also sorry for complaining this much… I’m a second year now—a senior, so I’ve gotta pull myself together…

*<th>(Breathe in, breathe out)</th>*

*The green flames are the mark of compassion!*

*The great nature, growing infinitely! Ryusei Green, Takamine Midori!*

Ahaha… I feel better whenever I say this, like I’ve really transformed into a hero…

The real me has no proper footing, and is super uncool, but… I hope I could grow infinitely, just like my catch phrase—even if it’ll take a while…

And that’s how I’ll be doing my best, so… Please do support me, Miss Producer…♪
