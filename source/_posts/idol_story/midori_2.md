{% bubble Midori %}
Here we go, heave-ho… Haah, I think that’s enough fertilizer? Just preparing the tools has drained me, I wanna go home…

This may be part of my club activities, but it’s all optional, so it wouldn’t make anyone angry if I just went home…

But tiding everything when I *just* took the effort to set things up would be pointless… I’ll try to work hard for a little, maybe…?

Maybe I could cheer myself with a “hip-hip, hurray! ♪”……

<th>(Nope, that was emptier than I thought… Seriously, what am I doing talking to myself… We’re just gardening here, y’know…)</th>

<th>(No one saw me, right? If someone did I’d die from embarrassment… Gotta be quiet—just do everything quietly….)</th>

<th>(I guess I’ll start with getting rid of weeds… Hrmm, the roots seem pretty deep down… I don’t think I can pull them out that easily…)</th>

<th>(I always pull them by hand, but maybe I should try out the weed puller for the first time…?)</th>

<th>(I know how to use it… I should, at least. I’ve seen other people use it…)</th>

<th>(But what if I accidentally break it…? No, I just need to pull the root up, so… Yeah, it’ll be okay…)</th>

…Ohhh!

<th>(Wow, this is so much fun…♪ I can pull them out without even trying.)</th>

<th>(Wait, how can it be *this* easy? Why have I been pulling them with just my hands this whole time… I’m so depressed…)</th>

<th>(W-Well, anyway, getting back on track… Let’s get rid of the rest.)</th>

<th>(Grab the root, and pull…)</th>

<th>(Ahh, feels so good. I didn’t expect this to be so soothing…♪)</th>

♪\~♪\~♪

… Ahaha, I’m having so much fun that I’ve started humming. Being able to do work at my own pace is so nice… Ahh, this is the very essence of peace…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shinobu %}
Oh-oh! Is that you, Midori-kun!?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
Wha—!? Shinobu-kun?

Wait, don’t tell me you heard me humming… So depressing…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shinobu %}
Why are you holding your head, Midori-kun?

No, never mind that!

I beg you! Please hide me somewhere!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
Hide…? Did you do something…? Did you hit Kunugi-sensei’s glasses with a shuriken or…?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shinobu %}
That would take some high level skill to properly perform. I hope to be able to throw a shuriken that accurately someday…♪

No, wait—This isn’t the time! Is there any place I can hide!? Ahh, I must hide now, or the pursuer will…!!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
Um. I dunno what’s going on, but you wanna hide somewhere, right? How about I try hiding you with this blue tarp…

Could you sit in front of this planter?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shinobu %}
Got it~
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
Now I’ll put this tarp on you, and…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shinobu hidden %}
Midori-kun, Midori-kun! Am I concealed?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
U-Uh-huh… Nobody will noti—

<th>(Nope, he’ll be spotted instantly. The shape looks so weird, it’s clearly suspicious…)</th>

—! I hear footsteps. It sounds like they’re coming closer…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shinobu hidden %}
Uwawa—It’s definitely the pursuer!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
<th>(W-What do I do… At this point, I’ve just gotta be a wall to hide the tarp from sight…!)</th>

<th>(Please, don’t notice anything…!)</th>
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Yuta %}
Hrmmm… Is there anyone here?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
<th>(That voice… It sounds like either Yuta-kun or Hinata-kun… I can’t move right now, so I can’t check which twin it is…)</th>
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Yuta %}
This really felt like a good place for one of them to hide in, though… Oh well, I’ll look somewhere else.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
<th>(… Whew, seems like he gave up.)</th>

… Shinobu-kun, I think it’s okay to come out now.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shinobu %}
Really…?

Whew—I’m so glad! I escaped a fatal crisis…♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
You kept saying “pursuer”, so I thought it was way more serious, y’know…?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shinobu %}
You see, the Asobi club is currently playing tag within the whole ES building.

We have only one rule: Play tag in a gentlemanly way, without bothering anyone…☆
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
Mrmm… I don’t think gentlemen play tag, though…?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shinobu %}
Urm, your retort was right on the dot… I apologize for disturbing you while you were working.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
Well, I was only working in silence anyway, so… Don’t worry about it.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shinobu %}
I realized this once you put the tarp over me, but were you tending the plants?

Yuta-kun is “it” right now, but I don’t think he will be back for a while, so I shall help you out.

Pretending to be a gardener to conceal myself feels spy-like~♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
I’m only doing it for myself, so you don’t have to… But sure, why not… Okay, then how about you get rid of the weeds from that planter…?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shinobu %}
Understood! I shall pour my heart into extracting them~♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
It’s only weeds, so I don’t think you’ll need to do that…

Asobi club… If I remember clearly, you guys literally just play around together?

It has all kinds of people from different units in it… It does sound sorta fun…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shinobu %}
Wooah~! Are you perhaps secretly interested in joining us, Midori-kun!?

Harukawa-kun, Yuta-kun, and Sazanami-dono are all in it—It’s quite fun~♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
Ah, sorry, but no thanks… I do think it sounds fun, but I doubt I could keep up with any of you…

Gardening fits me way better, I think…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shinobu %}
Oh, alright. That’s a bit of a shame~

If you ever felt like joining, please do inform me. The club will always be happy to welcome you~♪
