Oh, Anzu! You’ve been here even though it’s summer holidays! Good work! ☆

Hm, me? I’m about to head to the Handicraft Club.

He’s not here with me, but Kanata’s going there too.

              I see… I’ll have to thank Itsuki and Kagehira-kun.

              Hm? Ahh, Ryuseitai will be participating in the Shooting Star Festival, so I’ve asked Itsuki to make the outfits for us.

              That’s probably why they’ve been working until really late.

              Hm? Ahh, it’s a local summer festival.

              They keyword of the festival this year is “Shooting Star” <small>(Ryusei)</small>, so it was a calling to us.

              Outfits? Ahh, the ones for the Shooting Star Festival, right?

              It is true that we’ll need outfits made for both Valkyrie and Ryuseitai.

              I’m sure Itsuki wouldn’t mind if you asked him if there’s anything you can help with.

              I’m guessing you mean the Shooting Star Festival outfits.

              You’re already working on the Quarrel Festival outfits, and I don’t find it admirable to be doing work all over the place, y'know?

              Hm? To you, working during summer is a valuable way to spend your time?
