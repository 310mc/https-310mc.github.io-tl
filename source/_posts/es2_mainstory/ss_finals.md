{% bubble Subaru %}
——Ryuseitai!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Hokuto %}
Don’t set out to battle just yet!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki %}
Hm? Hidaka? Akehoshi? What’s up, what’s wrong?

I thought you guys at Trickstar became much more quiet this year. Are you actually planning to cause a stir on this final stage…?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora %}
Spare us from any unnecessary disruptions, ‘kay?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Subaru %}
We wouldn’t do that! How *rude!* Hrmph, hrmph!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Hokuto %}
It’s as Akehoshi says. We’re extremely grateful to Morisawa-senpai — No, to Ryuseitai as a whole, for what you’ve all done for us during the first DDD.

We will never forget what you did for us. We assure you that we won’t do anything to repay that kindness with spite instead.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
So you say, but all you did in Tanabata last year was put pressure on us… My depression got <em>worse</em> for a while after that, y’know…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shinobu %}
Ahaha, but thanks to everything that had happened then, we were able to finally peel off our newbie labels. All’s well that ends well!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
Well, I’m sure it was nice for you since you were just flirting with Isara-senpai, Shinobu-kun… but it was a traumatic experience for me, personally…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Subaru %}
Huh? Why? Did we do something to you, Takamin?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
You <em>see</em> what I mean…? Could you guys please understand your position for once…?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Hokuto %}
We’re told that often. Especially lately.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata %}
erm. did you have something to [tell] us, trickstar?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki %}
Fuhaha! You came to cheer for us as fellow members of the Red Team, right? I’m sure that’s why!

Thank you! We’ll turn your cheers into strength, and march forth!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Subaru %}
Chi~chan-senpai…

(I really can’t say it after all… He won’t listen even if I tried… After all, I got that from him in the end.)

No, never mind. Mhm, I just came to cheer for you guys. Do your best out there!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
Um, we don’t need <em>you</em> to tell us that, ‘kay? We’re gonna do our best no matter what. Does everyone seriously just see us as weaklings or something?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shinobu %}
Ohhh, Midori-kun suddenly became so energetic!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora %}
He’s got a stronger fighting spirit than you’d first expect, after all~! ♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Hokuto %}
…Yeah. If Ryuseitai wins here, we’ll have won four battles in a row, and it would let us Red Team win in the end.

Knowing the victor half-way into the event would ruin the fun for everything, but—

At least it would mean that once we’re up next, we can perform as we like, without worrying about victories and losses.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Subaru %}
Mhm! We prefer it that way, anyway, so make sure you win, Ryuseitai! ♪ We’re all pretty tired of all this fighting and crushing each other, anyway!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora %}
Ahaha, that’s so not like you guys.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Hokuto %}
What do you mean?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
Wh— Why do you look so surprised…? Maybe you aren’t like that this year, but you guys were basically picking a fight with anyone last year, like you were some biker gang…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Hokuto %}
Biker gang… I suppose that is a perfectly fitting phrase for us.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Subaru %}
Ohh, incredible Takamin! You’re so precise! So smart! There, there, there~♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
Don’t get near me! I don’t want your pestering! Can you just go already if you’re done talking…!?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Subaru %}
But Takamin, you love being pat like this, right? ♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
I’d never be happy being pat by *you!*
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata %}
fufu, exactly~ i will not say that your help is [unnecessary], but…

there is no [need] to worry about us. we will not lose anymore.

we will win this [battle], and ensure [victory] for the [red team], all so that we may [relieve] those who will [perform] after us.

don’t you think that is very ryuseitai of us?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki %}
Exactly what Kanata said! Believe in us and watch over us, Trickstar! We won’t lose to anyone any further!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Hokuto %}
I see. Then we’ll believe in you all.

That’s good enough, right, Akehoshi?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Subaru %}
Mhm. If anything, I’m sorry we ruined your focus just before your performance.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
You *really* did… What an absolute nuisance.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora %}
Now, now… They aren’t the type to act on ill intent, so let’s laugh it off and forgive ‘em.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata %}
laugh and forgive! that is also very ryuseitai-like~♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Subaru %}
Ahaha~ True, that’s what I love about you guys.

You always give me energy and courage.  …Good luck out there, I mean it!

♪\~♪\~♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Hokuto %}
Right, we’ll excuse ourselves now. Sorry for the trouble.

We wish you the best of luck from the bottom of our hearts.
