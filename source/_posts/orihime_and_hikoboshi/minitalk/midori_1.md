Ah— Anzu-san… Are you here to look for Isara-senpai?

Morisawa-senpai took him somewhere, 'cause he didn't want to talk about something where I could hear it…

*Sigh…* I'm being left out of the group…

              Who knows… He said it's something between adults only, and that it isn't for kids to hear…

              I'm only one or two years apart from my seniors, so being treated as a kid is kinda just…

Uu~… This is why I didn't wanna do a joint practice…

              It's way less noisy without him around though, so it's fine like this, isn't it…

              I heard from Isara-senpai that he went to the hospital…
