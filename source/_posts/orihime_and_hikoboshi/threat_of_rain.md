{% bubble Tetora %}
Please excuse us!

Ossu! Nagumo Tetora, Takamine Midori, Sengoku Shinobu — We, Ryuseitai, have arrived!

We're in your care today, Trickstar-senpais~!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori curious %}
…'scuse me…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shinobu worried %}
Y-You have to properly greet them, Midori-kun!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora %}
So do you, Sengoku-kun! They’re gonna be guiding us, so we gotta be polite. Karate starts with a bow and ends with a bow! ♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
Carrot-y?[^1] Wait, why're you suddenly acting as our leader, Tetora-kun?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora surprised %}
Wha—? Uhh, I thought you two were bad at stuff like this, sooo…?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora %}
If you wanna be the temporary leader, then feel free, Midori-kun~♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori shocked %}
No, no, no way, nooo way… You're just fine for it…

Didn’t Morisawa-senpai say something about entrusting that role to you whenever he's not around…?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora awkward %}
……Well, he didn't actually clearly *say* that to me, though…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shinobu curious %}
Umm, guys… I don't see any of our Trickstar seniors here.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora surprised2 %}
Whaaa!? You're right! Did we get the meeting place wrong?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori worried %}
Huh!? We already messed up? W-What do we do…?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shinobu thinking %}
Hmm… I know Isara-dono and Yuuki-dono's phone numbers, so I will ask one of them.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
Sengoku-kun, I thought you were like me and had no friends, but you actually know quite a few people, huh…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shinobu grin %}
Nihihi, ever since I joined this school, I have gotten to know more people, and make friends~♪

Ah, he picked up! Hello, Yuuki-dono? It is I, Sengoku Shinobu~!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Makoto %}
Yes yes, hellooo~! ♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shinobu surprised %}
Nwoh!? A response from behind!? Who…!?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Makoto %}
It's me! Sorry for making you call us. Were you guys worried because we weren't here yet? We’re wasting phone credit, so I’m hanging up, okay?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shinobu worried %}
Ah! Yes! Please do as you like…!!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Makoto %}
Ahaha, you seem nervous. I feel you~ I'm super nervous about this, too.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Hokuto %}
Yuuki, don't stop in the doorway. I can't get inside.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Makoto awkward %}
Ah, sorry. I never pay enough attention…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Subaru %}
Comin' in\~! Sorry we’re late! We had to carry practice stuff here, see\~?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora %}
That’s okay, but you could've told us… It looks really heavy, so let me help you, Senpai!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Subaru %}
Thankies~! ☆ You’re a lifesaver! Let me praise you! Well done! ♪ <em><th>(pat, pat)</th></em>
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora surprised %}
Wawa— Don't just let go of the thing!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori sad4 %}
<th>(I-It's lively all of a sudden… I feel really awkward whenever it’s like this…)</th>
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shinobu v2 %}
Midori-kun, Midori-kun, we should help carry their equipment! You are good at stuff like that, are you not?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori sad2 %}
Y-Yeah… But today we were only planning to introduce ourselves to each other, and then decide what to do next, right…? Are we gonna use this stuff for practice right now…?

Nobody told me about this…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Subaru %}
What're you mumbling about, Takamin?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori surprised %}
Eeep! Don't sneak behind me for no reason! Also, could you please not call me “Takamin”…?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Subaru %}
Huh? I can't? But nicknames make us feel close, right?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori idle %}
But we aren’t really that close, are we…?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Hokuto %}
Right, we've carried it all inside. We'll go over everything right now, so gather up.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora %}
Ossu! Ahaha, things are getting hectic here, huh? I guess we’re not the only unit who doesn’t do things properly.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Makoto worried %}
C-Crap, this is bad, Hidaka-kun! He just said we're not doing things properly!!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Hokuto %}
This is why I keep telling you guys to be more serious.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora %}
Ah, no, I didn't mean it that way. I meant that we're pretty similar, so it feels like it’ll be easier to work together.

Right, Midori-kun?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori sigh2 %}
Why're you asking me… Don't mind me, just keep talking on your own…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Hokuto %}
Alright then. Let me introduce myself again: I'm the leader of Trickstar, Hidaka Hokuto.

I'm the one with the highest position here, so I'll be leading these joint practice sessions.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Subaru angry2 %}
Huh? Whaddya mean highest position? We're equals, aren't we?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Hokuto %}
Of course, but if there isn't someone at the top, things will fall apart. I'm the one recorded as the leader in the official papers, so I’m suitable for the role, no?

We could’ve left it to Anzu, but she's currently working on the planning and management of the Tanabata Festival.

She's busy right now, so we can't have her do things for us.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Makoto %}
I think she’s the only one who properly knows all the people gathered here… I wish she could've been here to introduce us, at least.

But she had to leave after getting a sudden call from the Student Council…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Subaru %}
Oh, and Sally~ is busy with Student Council stuff on-site, so he said he’ll be late.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora curious %}
Oh right, Taichou— I mean, Morisawa-senpai won’t be here either since he's sick, and we dunno where Shinkai-senpai is.

Also, who's “Sally~”? I can't tell from that nickname.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori idle %}
Isn't it Isara-senpai…? Akehoshi-senpai calls him that during basketball practice…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shinobu thinking2 %}
Hm, so Isara-dono will be late… That is a shame — he would have set us all at ease just by being here.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Hokuto %}
Well, he’ll be back later; we just have to do what we can for now. This is a strange twist of fate for both of us, but… I hope we can get along.

Let’s get to know one another, and help each other grow.
{% endbubble %}

## Chapter 2

{% img /img/es/eventstory/orihimeandhikoboshi/threat2_1.jpg %}

<div class="msr-narration">
    <p>Several minutes later…</p>
</div>

{% bubble Hokuto %}
Right, has everyone finished changing?

Looks like we all briefly introduced ourselves while changing. Okay, good, everything’s going well.

Alright. Us joining hands was very sudden, so there may be some confusion and a few things that'll be harder to do, but…

I hope we can support each other in order to do our best at the Tanabata Festival.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Subaru %}
Ah! And we'll introduce Sally\~ to you guys once he's here! Takamin already knows him well, though\~♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori thinking2 %}
Ah, no… I haven't really talked to him that much, so I don't really know him well, but… he seems like a good, kind person to me…

Like, he seems to be someone I can have an actual conversation with, unlike you and Morisawa-senpai…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Subaru %}
Whaa\~? Don't put me together with Chi\~chan-senpai! We can talk to each other properly, too! Let's get along! Handshake\~♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori worried2 %}
Ughh… I knew it, this guy’s also the pushy type…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shinobu thinking2 %}
<th>(Mmm… I also know Isara-dono very well, but I suppose there is no need to point that out right now…)</th>

<th>(I love Isara-dono, but I do not know how he feels about me…)</th>
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shinobu frown %}
<th>(I'll feel bad if I act like he and I are close…)</th>

<th>(Isara-dono is likely kind to anyone, and gets along well with everyone. It is not that I am special or anything.)</th>
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori curious %}
…Sengoku-kun? What’s wrong? Are you not feeling well?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shinobu v2 %}
Huh? No no, I am always feeling just fine! ♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori serious %}
You sure? It's easy to get a cold nowadays, so be careful, okay…?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori sigh2 %}
Morisawa-senpai's always touchy-feely with us, so I bet he's got all kinds of germs on him…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shinobu v2 %}
Ah, no, he doesn't do that to me as much as he does to you, so I am probably okay!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori sigh3 %}
Why's he always so clingy with me… It's seriously a huge pain…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Subaru grin %}
Ahaha, that's 'cause he always hugs the least energetic person he sees.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora curious %}
Umm… Could we not chit-chat, please…? Let's do this properly.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Hokuto %}
That's right, it's as Nagumo—…kun, says. Don't relax so much… Of course, being too nervous wouldn't be good, either.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora %}
Ah, you don't have to call me by “-kun”!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Hokuto %}
No, it feels wrong to talk and act superior to kids I don't know well.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Subaru grin %}
Ahaha, even though you always act that way to just about anyone! ♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Hokuto frown %}
Shut it. Anyway, let's first talk about our plans. Ahh man, why did it take us so long to reach this point?

Regardless, the Tanabata Festival is happening in a week, so we're going to be working towards it. We'll do our best there, and produce results.

I suppose that that's our common goal here.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora %}
Ah, yeah! We've been improving, so we wanna go and just charge in there.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Hokuto %}
Right. Let's cooperate with each other and help one another as much as we can.

Us Trickstar have already decided on what to do for the event, but what about you, Ryuseitai?

We could share the stage, advertisements, merchandise, and so on…

Especially the merchandise, since it’s much cheaper to manufacture a large amount at once.

We could also do warm-ups together, and anything else like it.

However, we're going to be doing two different performances, so we'll be splitting our units, and practicing separately.

If there's anything you're struggling with in your performance, ask us about it.

We'll guide you as best as we can, as your seniors… Heh~♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora surprised %}
Huh!? W-Wait, hold on! This is completely different from what we thought… Like, I feel as though we're not on the same page…?

Aren't we gonna do a joint live for the event?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Hokuto serious %}
…? Joint? I suppose you could call it that. We *are* going to be on the same stage, after all.

However, in Tanabata Festival, units come on stage to compete against each other.

If both of us were on stage at the same time, we’d be opponents.

That's how it is… right, Yuuki?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Makoto surprised %}
Huh? Why are you asking me?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Hokuto %}
You're always thinking about things, unlike Akehoshi, so knowing your opinion would be handy.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Subaru angry2 %}
Hokke~, can’t you open your mouth *once* without picking a fight with me?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Makoto awkward %}
Let’s stay calm now… What Hidaka-kun said about Tanabata Festival is true, yes.

Two units take up the stage together, and compete in a performance battle.

The winning unit stays on, and the losing unit has to leave. Basically, if you win, you get to perform again.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Makoto %}
So I'm guessing you guys haven’t read up on the event?

You never know what could come up next, so you need to check the bulletin board more often, you know?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora frown3 %}
Ack… Taichou'd always explain everything we need to know, so I didn't think of doin' that… I'm sorry, I'll do better next time.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori sad4 %}
Yeah… I thought we could just ask about it once we were here… But, right… Morisawa-senpai's sick, so he’s not here to tell us…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shinobu v2 %}
Ah! I knew such things about the event, though!

I helped Isara-dono and Anzu-dono on the plans by gathering necessary materials for them, you see.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora angry4 %}
Oh? Really? Then you should've told us earlier!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shinobu worried %}
I-I apologize. I did not expect anyone not to know about it, and nobody asked me about it, either…
{% endbubble %}

## Chapter 3

{% bubble Subaru frown %}
I'm worried about you guys… You sure you're gonna be okay like this?

Chi~chan-senpai is gonna graduate in less than a year from now — he can't keep carrying you around, y’know?

And it's not like we can watch over you the whole way. You're not babies, so walk on your own a little.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Hokuto %}
True, but we've been asked to take care of them, so… We need to be responsible and do that, as much as we can.

Still, does that mean you haven’t decided on what you'll do for the Tanabata Festival?

There’s not much time left… It's too late to prepare your performance plans or outfits, even.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Subaru angry2 %}
Seriously! What were you guys doing? Were you just sleeping?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora sad2 %}
Nghh… If we had to have an excuse, we really thought this'd be a joint live with Trickstar, and thought our programs for the event would be the same, too…

Our joint lives have always been that way… I thought we just had to do the best we could with whatever we’re told, just like we always do…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Subaru curious %}
Hmm? Is Ryuseitai really always like that, Takamin?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori worried %}
Huh—? Yeah, basically… Morisawa-senpai would always show us what to do and guide us through practically everything…

Like, it’s as if he’s just dragging us into whatever he’s planned…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori thinking2 %}
We do throw our complaints and opinions in there sometimes, but well… I mean, we do basically end up properly performing as idols thanks to that, I guess…?

So, yeah… It's always like that…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Subaru frown %}
Huh… So you're basically kids who've been protected way too much.

I'm starting to feel that bad part about Chi~chan-senpai right now… He spoils you *way* too much. You guys are like those people who just went with the flow before we did our revolution.

I don't really wanna work with people like that.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori sad %}
…………
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Hokuto angry %}
Hey! Akehoshi! Don't start scolding them! We didn’t know left from right when we were first years either, and just went with the flow.

When you're still a novice, it's necessary to ask for instructions, and do exactly as you're told.

It's not too late to start learning independence *after* you've been taught the basics.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Subaru serious %}
It *is* too late. When I was a first year, I tried to plan out the things I wanted to do, and worked hard on them all on my own. I found jobs, and did the best I could alone.

That way, I got results, and started getting rewarded.

I acted like a proper idol — 'cause I *wanted* to become one.

Isn’t that why we're all in this school?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Subaru angry3 %}
But these kids don't seem that way. I can’t stand it.

That's right… Takamin, you took the idol course entrance exam by accident, right?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori sad2 %}
Ah— Um, yes… and then I passed it for some reason…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Subaru sideeye %}
That so. It means you’ve got the talent. Must be really hard on you to have all those extra intestines dangling out of you, huh?[^2]
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Hokuto shocked %}
H-Hey, Akehoshi… I don't understand — Why are you getting angry all of a sudden?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora curious %}
Um, did we do somethin' upsetting…?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora sad2 %}
You’re right, we didn't think ‘bout this properly. We relied on Taichou way too much, and never thought 'bout it on our own.

I really do wanna do better this time, and I’ll never let this happen ever again, so please forgive us.
{% endbubble %}

{% img /img/es/eventstory/orihimeandhikoboshi/subaruorigcg.jpg %}

{% bubble Tetora sad2 %}
Please, *please* forgive us.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Subaru angry %}
…Um, bowing your head down won't change anything.

Ryuseitai, you should just go home for today.

Even if you stay here, it's not like you have anything you could do… We'll meet up for practice tomorrow, so think of something to do before then.

Think up something you guys wanna perform. If you don't at least know *that*, then there's nothing we could do for you, so please.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora sad3 %}
……………
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Subaru frown %}
Mm\~… This is completely different to what Chi\~chan-senpai told me…

He kept telling me about how happy he is, that they've started to give him their opinions, and ideas on what they wanna do…

So I thought they’d have all sorts of ideas up their sleeves this time, too… so many that we wouldn’t even know how to help them…

I was even worried if I could guide them properly or not, but… I got anxious over literally nothing. Ahh, man…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Subaru %}
Well, whatever. Let's start our own practice, Hokke~! There's not much left 'til the event, so we can't waste any more time!

Let's send our own shine to the whole world~!☆
{% endbubble %}

## Chapter 4

<div class="msr-narration">
    <p>Several minutes later…</p>
</div>

{% bubble Hokuto %}
Right, looks like we've all finished our warm-ups.

It’s time we began our dance practice.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Makoto %}
O-Okay… The choreography is the same thing I sent you guys digitally.

It's mainly centered around Isara-kun and Akehoshi-kun, since they’re both good at dancing. It might be a little tough, though.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Subaru %}
Really? It looks fun! I like it~! ☆

It’s become a lot easier to check our choreography ever since you started using that CG program on your phone or laptop or whatever! It’s a big help!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Makoto %}
Mhm. I'm still far behind when it comes to dancing and singing, and I can't model much for photoshoots, either…

So I’ve been doing this in the hopes that I can be useful to you guys.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Hokuto %}
You're not far behind, Yuuki.

I disapprove of how you diminish your role like this whenever you come up with ideas. We're all equals here — it's much more like us to perform side by side.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Makoto %}
Ah, Anzu-chan told me something similar. Since she’s the producer, I always have to check our program and plans with her beforehand.

Lately, she’s been approving everything I show her with a “well, if you guys are going to do it together, then it’s all good!” and stuff, but it just makes me worried about it instead…

I'd rather her criticize everything in detail, honestly.

I mean, I doubt my ideas are flawless. If she doesn’t properly tell me what she thinks, I'll start feeling like she doesn't really care.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Hokuto %}
Hm. That's true, I feel like she's been working with other units more often lately, and hasn't really been around us.

It's a little lonely without her.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Makoto %}
Yeah, though it *does* mean that she's being valued as a producer… We have to be happy for her, and support her.

I mean, people have been holding her work in high regard lately.

She's been chosen to plan an S1 event, after all — That's a big step up for her.

We have to celebrate for her sake. Though it is lonely, yeah…

Actually, no — Our repayment to her will be to shine to the fullest in Tanabata Festival.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Subaru %}
Mhm, mhm! Let's do our very best~ Starting with our dance practice!

So, just like we always do it, the one who’s the best coaches for the rest, right? Sally\~ isn't here, so I'm the best at dancing\~! ☆

I had a feeling this'd happen, so I practiced the choreography at home! Watch closely — I'm about to show you how to do it~! ☆

♪\~♪\~♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Hokuto %}
Huh… This requires more acrobatic skill than usual. We could trip over our legs, even.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Makoto %}
Yep, the theme is “Tanabata,” after all. It's originally a Chinese tradition, so I put in some kung fu-like dance moves.[^3]
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Hokuto %}
Ahh, now that you mention it, it does look like kung fu. So we're going for Chinese-style martial arts, huh…

It requires a lot of physical exertion… I feel like this might be rough on us — it's the summer, so it's much easier to lose stamina.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Makoto %}
Ah, I left the hard stuff out, and only put the general concept of kung fu into the choreography.

We'll keep in mind how much we can do, and think on how to change it around for the final version.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Subaru %}
Hey hey, Ukki~ This move is supposed to look like a star, right? ‘Cause it's Tanabata, right? And when you think of Tanabata, you think of the Milky Way, of course! ♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Makoto %}
Yep! Orihime and Hikoboshi were originally stars, after all.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Hokuto %}
…? I don't get it, how does that dance move look like a star?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Subaru %}
Ah, I'm the only one dancing here, so you probably couldn’t tell.

Look, this is my move — then this is yours, this is Ukki\~'s, and this is Sally\~'s!

When you put them together… you see it?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Hokuto %}
Ooh, you're right, it's a star. So we make a star by positioning our hands and legs, I see.

I've done something like that before for a Theater Club performance.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Makoto %}
Ehehe. You’ve mentioned it before, that’s where I got the idea.

I'm glad — looks like it's easy to tell it’s a star~ Stuff like this is only noticeable once you see it for yourself.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Hokuto %}
Hmm. Tanabata Festival’s stage is outside, and the performance begins in the evening, so we have to consider the lighting, too.

The audience might not be able to see the shape if it’s too dark.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Subaru %}
True! We’ll tell Anzu to ask the backstage people to adjust the lighting for us!

Oh, wait! What if we just attach neon lights on our bodies? It’ll be easier to see like that!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Makoto %}
Making a star through lights does sound like a neat idea… But we’ve already sorted our outfit designs, so I don’t think it’s possible to adjust them anymore…?

It might ruin our performance’s balance, or end up being a nuisance to our opponents.

I think we should go for something less obvious, but still possible to tell for whoever is observant enough.

And if we really want it to be known, we can tell them about it during the after-talk.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Subaru %}
True\~ Heheh, this really is lotsa fun\~! Talking about the performance and practicing together is true happiness!

We haven’t been able to meet each other, right? It made me feel so lonely! But hopefully, we’ll have a great time together at the event!

Summer holidays are right after, so I’m gonna do my ultimate best!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Hokuto %}
We’ve got work during the holidays, too. In fact, it’s then that an idol’s work increases tenfold, so don’t use up all your energy.

I doubt you’d get affected by the summer heat, but my grandma always says that idiots catch a summer cold, so. Take care of your health as much as you can.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Subaru %}
Oh? You just called me an idiot, didn’t you? Ukki~, let ‘im have it!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Makoto %}
Mhm, you were very mean just now\~! Repent\~♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Hokuto %}
Wha— Yuuki, stop. Don’t do that weird “reflect light off glasses” trick. It’s blinding.

    <p>Meanwhile, outside the dance room that Trickstar is practicing in…</p>
</div>

{% bubble Shinobu %}
…We got scolded really badly.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
Yeah… That was kinda scary… I always thought Akehoshi-senpai just goofs around… I never thought he could get angry like that…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shinobu %}
It felt more like he was looking down on us… Rather than scared, I would say I was shocked.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
…I dunno what he couldn't stand about us, but he didn’t have to say it like that…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shinobu %}
Fufu… I, once again, realize just how kind and considerate Taichou-dono is towards us.

I feel like it has been a long time since I was last scolded.

See, I used to get scolded often for all the ninja stuff I would do…

But ever since I came to this school, everyone has been praising and accepting me, so I ended up letting my guard down.

I have allowed myself to relax too much… Now I have become spoiled rotten. I must learn to do better.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
Yeah… Anyway, why are we still standing here in the hallway? He told us to go home, so… let’s go?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shinobu %}
No, I feel like we shouldn't leave.

If we do just what we are told again, as if all we can do is obey without thought, then it is only more proof that we are just a bunch of good-for-nothing children.

Let us stay here and watch what our seniors in Trickstar are doing from afar. We will use them as reference, and contemplate what to do next together.

If they notice us and scold us to go home again, we will relocate.

Until then, we shall stay here and think about what to perform. We shall work hard through hell and high water!

And if we come up with something, we will go inform them about it.

If they accept our idea, then we will bow our heads down in respect and ask to be permitted in their practice.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
Ehhh… But I wanna go home…

Well… It *is* annoying to get told off without being able to say anything back…

<th>(We'll have to stop him if that happens… Sengoku-kun's not strong enough to do it alone, so it has to be me…)</th>

<th>(All of this has been tiring, but, honestly… I'm sure if I go home now, I'll just feel more and more irritated… I have to get rid of this feeling before I go to sleep tonight…)</th>

<th>(Otherwise, I'll feel even more depressed, and start wanting to die…)</th>

<th>(But really, Tetora-kun's making a super scary face… What's he thinking about…? Please spare us from a fight…)</th>
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora %}
<th>(Wow… They're amazing. It may seem like they're just playing around, but they're actually practicing properly.)</th>

<th>(They’re makin' sure to get every dance move right, asking each other for opinions, and then brushing up the entire choreography.)</th>

<th>(Though if you only heard them talk, it’d sound like they were just goofing around.)</th>

<th>(No — These people are dead serious. They know their goal, and they're heading towards it as one.)</th>

<th>(Everything they do leads them towards the proper path…)</th>

<th>(That's how they manage to give off a bright radiance — enough to light the whole world.)</th>

{% bubble Subaru %}
Hey, Ryuseitai kids. We're gonna get distracted if you keep staring at us.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shinobu %}
Eeek!? A-Akehoshi-dono, I deeply apologize for not leaving as you told us to!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Subaru frown %}
Mm. No… I let my anger get to me, and just lashed out… I'm sorry for that. It's not like you guys did anything wrong.

You're gonna start feeling hot if you stay here.

If you plan on learning from us, come back inside. We’d be in hot water too if you ended up collapsing.

Chi~chan-senpai would get furious with me. I saw him angry like that only once, and it was seriously terrifying.

## Chapter 6

{% img /img/es/eventstory/orihimeandhikoboshi/threat6_1.jpg %}

<div class="msr-narration">
    <p>Back to the present time…</p>
</div>

{% bubble Mao %}
…Hm. Alright, I think I've gotten the gist of it.

In my opinion, the fault lies with Trickstar.

There was no proper communication between the two units, and you weren’t being considerate of them. Since you’re in this together, you should've checked what they were doing before meeting up.

I'm sure you could’ve avoided this problem if you did that first.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Hokuto %}
…True. It's a bad habit of ours to start everything immediately without prior preparation.

We should've checked how they were doing beforehand.

I'm sorry, Ryuseitai.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora %}
Huh? No, no, you don't need to apologize! We didn't think this through at all! We really have learned from our mistakes!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mao %}
Alright. Now that both sides have learned their lesson, how about we start things over again?

We faltered a bit, but it's no big deal. We're the type to perform without any proper preparation, anyway.

So if worst comes to worst, we’ll just have to balance ourselves out when the time comes.

In fact, how about we aim for exactly that. Starting by apologizing for our mistakes, learning to do better, and growing from it.

So let's avoid dragging this gloomy atmosphere all the way to the event. We'd end up disappointing our audience if we do that, won't we?

Ryuseitai and Trickstar are both bright units with a fun air to them.

If we show ourselves like *this*, we'd be booed off the stage. We'd have failed their expectations and disappointed them.

We wouldn’t be fit to call ourselves idols.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Subaru serious %}
…………
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mao %}
Oh? Is something wrong, Subaru sir?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Subaru serious %}
Why’re you suddenly speaking politely… No, it's just as you said. I agree with you.

Sorry. I was reminded of what happened in the past, and got angry.

That rarely happens for me, so I didn't know how to control myself…

I'm sorry for snapping at you, Ryuseitai.

How we dealt with them after that was wrong, too, wasn’t it…?

If they haven't prepared anything for the event, then we could've planned a program with them.

Doing that would be *so* much more like us.

We should've shared our opinion, thought up all sorts of ideas together, and supported them.

But instead, all I did was get angry at them and kick them out… Ahh man, I'm an awful senior.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mao %}
Ahaha, just like how the first years are new to being idols, we're also new to being seniors.

It's no surprise that we’re not doing things properly yet.

In fact, isn’t that *exactly* why we decided to work with Ryuseitai? It was all to build up our experience.

Just think of it like, “we're lucky to have made mistakes.” I mean, you got something out of it, didn't you?

We're meant to keep going via trial and error, and to grow further from this.

…Haha! *I'm* the one who got here late, but I’m preaching to all of you like some kinda wise guy! Just who do I think I am, huh!?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Makoto %}
Ahaha, but I'm kind of glad you came late.

If you were here, you would've dealt with everything properly before it even became a problem — it'd all be gone in the blink of an eye.

We wouldn’t have been able to fail and grow from this experience if that happened.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shinobu %}
Fufu, that sounds similar to Taichou-dono.

He always takes good care of us and leads us, so that we never make mistakes.

But it is as Akehoshi-dono said; we cannot keep letting Taichou-dono carry us.

Otherwise, we'll never build the leg strength to walk on our own two feet.

That is why… I am glad that we got scolded.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mao %}
Sengoku… You're such a good boy! I want a little brother like you~♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shinobu %}
Huh!? I-If that is your wish, then I will become “Isara Shinobu” for you any time!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Subaru %}
Ahaha, that just sounds like you’re getting married to him.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
<th>(Huh… Whew, I'm so glad to see everything's turning peaceful…)</th>

<th>(Isara-senpai’s amazing… There's no way I could do something like that… I wonder what makes him different to me…? Is it our innate qualities…?)</th>

<th>(I wish God gave me what he has, instead of “pretty looks”…)</th>

<th>(This sucks… I'm just paper mache… I'm completely hollow inside…)</th>
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mao %}
W-What's wrong, Takamine? You've been gloomy for a while now…

I know I'm asking this really late, but why *are* you in that corner anyway?

You guys told me that Ryuseitai is currently watching and learning from Trickstar's practice session, right?

If that’s all you’re doing, then why're you hunched over there? Did someone tell you something mean?

For goodness’ sake… He may look strong 'cause of his build, but he's pretty timid. You can't bully him, Subaru… Got it?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Subaru %}
Huh—!? I didn't do that! …I think.
{% endbubble %}

## Chapter 7

{% bubble Subaru %}
Well, see… We told the kids to come back inside to watch us practice, right?

But then we thought they'd get bored just doing that, so we made them practice with us.

I mean, they wouldn't learn anything just by watching, after all. And the kid with the bangs *really* looked like he wanted to join in with the dancing.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shinobu %}
Is “kid with the bangs” intended to be me? I have already introduced myself to you earlier, so please call me by name!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Subaru %}
Lemme come up with a nickname~ How about I go with “Shinobun” and “Tetoran” to match with “Takamin”?

Anyway… after that, we started practicing together, but Takamin just wasn't following along…

I know I scolded them harshly earlier, so I tried to be nice this time and give them advice.

But then he just went and hunched in the corner.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mao %}
How'd that happen… Uh, what’d you tell him?

You tend to sound inconsiderate when you talk, so you probably hurt him without knowing.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Subaru %}
Huh~? Nah, I just said what’s on my mind.

Like, “why can't you get this right?” and “do it properly!” and “don’t you have any motivation?”
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mao %}
Holy… For an ordinary person, hearing that from a genius would hurt a *lot*.

I don't think he had no motivation, y’know. I'm sure he was trying to do it properly.

He may complain a lot, but he works hard at what he's told to.

But, see… There are people out there who can't do it even if they try. Even I have a hard time keeping up with you guys, y’know?

There's no *way* these novice first years can do what you can do.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
Exactly… *Thank* you, Isara-senpai…

I… I was doing my very best… He kept on saying awful things to me, so I thought I’d make him eat his words…

But I just can't do it… I can't do those super-agile moves… I start tripping up and falling over myself… My whole body hurts now… Everything sucks…

And still he kept on talking to me like I was just messing around… All I feel is rage and misery…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Subaru %}
Huh—…? S-Sorry, Takamin! Was I putting too much pressure on you?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
Not just me… They didn't say so, but I think Tetora-kun and Sengoku-kun were having a hard time, too… We were just scolded earlier, so it was hard to complain about it…

It was all too much… I’m so depressed, I just wanna die…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shinobu %}
Ahaha, cheer up, Midori-kun. I was having quite a lot of fun, you know~?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mao %}
Your body's light after all, Sengoku — extremely agile moves are your forte. It seems like you don't have enough stamina, though.

You're already feeling really tired, right? You’re almost out of breath.

Yet, despite how tired you were… You noticed how heavy the mood was, and came to ask me for help.

You moved accordingly to the situation! Good job, good job! ♪

You could've just called me, though. …Ah! Did you think you'd get scolded for using your phone during practice?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shinobu %}
Incredible as always, Isara-dono! You truly have great perception! Indeed, and so I told them I was in need of the bathroom, and quickly left to call for you.

I had left my belongings behind, so all I could do was dash to your side.

But I was right to bring you here! You are truly a relief to have around! Seriously, I respect you~! ☆
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mao %}
Thanks!

Wait, we shouldn't just keep complimenting each other… We won't get anything done if we keep on chatting, so let's start practice for real now.

Oh wait, that’s right — I heard about this while I was dealing with the event preparations, but…

Apparently there's a festival going on in town today.

If it’s alright with you guys, wanna go together? You’ve been wanting to do something like that, yeah? So it's just the perfect timing~♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Hokuto %}
Mm? Do we even have the time for something like that? There's not much left until Tanabata Festival — We shouldn’t play around.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mao %}
Thought you'd say that. But honestly, rushing practice wouldn’t help us. After all, we *have* joined up for this event, so wouldn't it be good to deepen our bonds as well?

Festivals are just the right place for that.

Let's stroll around the stalls and get to know each other better.

If we were adults, this kinda stuff would be cut short. After all, adults can still get the job done without being friends.

And whenever I hear my parents talk about work, I tend to think that those drinking get-togethers of theirs are a waste of time.[^4]

But y’know, we're still kids. We don't have to keep working in the most efficient way possible.

We should start by getting to know each other, and getting along. We’ll still have time to work after all that.

We're still in our “grace period”, so to say — it's fine if we take detours, and make mistakes here and there. I’m sure that it’s those experiences that’ll be most useful to us when we become adults.

The Vice-Prez is always saying stuff like that.

He's all about work, but I think that's exactly why he keeps telling us to go and have fun.

The kids who have the most fun — the ones who enjoy their youth as much as they can… They become the winners once they're adults.

We don't have to constantly think about work, and desperately keep trying to produce more results, do we?

After all, back when most people only cared about getting rewards and other useless junk—

The ones who told them, “Have some fun!” “Have a dream or two!” “Enjoy your youth to the fullest!,” and made them see that—

Were us, Trickstar — Us, who carried out the revolution… right?

That's the sort of Trickstar I love.

*They're* the ones who saved me in the past — the me who did nothing but work so he could be useful to others, and whose only reward was the praise of adults.

Isara-dono~ Over here, over here! I can see the festival~♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mao %}
Don't pull me, Sengoku… Man, your hand is really warm… Little kids have warmer body temperature~♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shinobu %}
I'm not a little kid! Everyone has gone ahead of us. We have to hurry over, or we will be left behind!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mao %}
Ahaha. Yeah, it was surprising to find out that the festival is closing earlier than usual. If we don’t make it in time, we won’t be able to catch the stalls open. That’s probably why they’re rushing so much.

Anyway… I know I said all that stuff earlier, but…

Honestly, I'm worried about the work I left behind. I'm thinking of quickly zipping through the festival and going right back to school.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shinobu %}
Huh!? We are going to deepen our bonds, are we not!? Let's have fun to the very end! If you are not here, who knows when the mood might go down again…!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mao %}
Hmm… I think you guys’ll be alright. You were just not used to each other, that’s all.

And I really do think that Trickstar and Ryuseitai are similar, since they’re both bright types of units.

You guys will get along superbly with the right opportunity.

Like, look — they’ve already forgotten about the mess earlier. They’re having a great time now.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shinobu %}
Ahaha, that is true. I wonder what they're talking about~?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mao %}
If you're curious, then go ahead and ask them, instead of talking to me.

I gotta check up on the Student Council members that I left behind at school.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shinobu %}
Ninja art! Phone seizing technique~☆
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mao %}
Ah— Hey! Give it back!

Why're you acting like this all of a sudden? You're usually a well-behaved kid…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shinobu %}
…………
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mao %}
Sengoku? Why'd you go quiet? D-Don’t worry, I'm not angry at you, okay?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shinobu %}
Isara-dono, you—

…Mm. Never mind, it is nothing.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mao %}
Hmm? Oh c’mon, now you’ve got me curious\~ If you have something to say, then you gotta say it, you little rascal\~♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shinobu %}
Waa~! You caught me!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mao %}
You better start saying it, you~! I'll punish you with tickles if you don't!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shinobu %}
Eeek— Nihahaha!! ☆ I give, I give\~! Don't tickle me\~!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mao %}
Bwahaha! You're a *ninja!* You should have the discipline to withstand torture\~! Maybe *this*’ll make you admit defeat\~! Tickle tickle\~♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shinobu %}
Aha— Hahaha!! ☆ S-Seriously, please, I give in! I can't breathe~!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mao %}
…Ahh, it's so hot! It was refreshing and cool inside the room, so being close to someone wasn’t too bad, but doing it outside just makes you sweat hard, huh!

It's 100% summer now — it's super humid even at night!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shinobu %}
*Huff… Huff…* Ahh… I thought I was going to die…

…Isara-dono, I really respect you.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mao %}
Huh\~!? Why're you complimenting me all of a sudden!? You're making me blush\~!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shinobu %}
…When the atmosphere became tense today, I could not do anything about it myself…

All I could do was call for you with the hope that you could do something.

Everyone in Ryuseitai had saved me…

And they made me, who was always doing ninja stuff all on his own, into an idol — into a comrade who can pursue dreams with them…

A ninja’s one true mission is to be of use to people, and yet… I could not think of what to do… I simply panicked.

I find that part of me so pathetic.

But, by my side is you, Isara-dono. The splendid you, who can be my role model. That makes me so happy.

It makes me feel like I can grow and mature more and more.

I want to grow big, enough to reach the stars in the sky. That is what I will write for my Tanabata wish.

That is all! Ehehe~♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mao %}
Ah, yeah… I see. I'm not sure I get it, but good luck.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shinobu %}
Yes! It is fine if you only do it whenever you have the time, but please watch over me… It would make me happy, Isara-dono!

Although, ninjas are meant to be concealed in the dark, so you may have a hard time finding me!

That is all I wanted to say!

I’m really sorry, it was hard to understand, wasn't it!?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mao %}
Nah… I mean, I've never really understood you from the day we met. I feel that way about practically everyone in this school, though.

But I've always been the second or third in everything… There was nothing I excelled in.

I've never been considered a role model for anything before, so I’m happy you told me that.

Makes me a little nervous, since I’m still not doing everything properly. I gotta work harder now, so I don't start disappointing you.

Everyone around me is shining so brightly, after all. I gotta keep working hard and not fall behind, else I'll just disappear into the crowd.
{% endbubble %}

{% img /img/es/eventstory/orihimeandhikoboshi/shinobuorigcg.jpg %}

{% bubble Shinobu %}
Isara-dono! Look, look! It's the Milky Way! We can see it even when it isn't Tanabata yet, huh?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mao %}
Ooh, you're right! It's so pretty… Ah, that reminds me — we might have cloudy weather on the day of Tanabata Festival, so we may not be able to see it then.

That's why we should admire the scenery now as much as we can.

Actually, y'know what— Both “Trickstar” and “Ryuseitai” have the word “star”[^5] in its name…

If we were to gather together, I'm sure *we* could become a shining, sparkling Milky Way.

## Translation Notes
[^1]: Tetora says the word *budou* for Karate, and Midori misunderstands it as *budou* for grapes, hence why he responds back in confusion. I tried to give the English version a similar feel.
[^2]: Subaru’s “intestines” line is a reference to what he said in <a href="https://ensemble-stars.fandom.com/wiki/Rocket_Start" target="_blank">Rocket Start</a> - Set Theory 5.
[^3]: Check <a href="/orihime_and_hikoboshi#Translation-Notes" target="_blank">the cover</a> for extra info about Trickstar and Ryuseitai's Tanabata performances.
[^4]: In Japan, there is a work culture to have “drinking get-togethers,” which is basically a way to get to know each other. You can be peer pressured into doing it, even if you aren't interested, usually for the sake of keeping your position at work.
[^5]: “Ryuseitai” lit. means shooting star/meteor squad, and the *sei* in Ryuseitai means “star”.
