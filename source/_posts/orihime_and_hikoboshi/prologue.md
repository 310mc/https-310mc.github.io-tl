‘Sup, transfer student! How’s the the summer S1 event proposal going?

I brought over a bunch of materials and examples of other proposals from the Student Council office. These documents were the only ones I was allowed to take.

We’re not allowed to photocopy these, so hand them back once you’re done reading them for today.

Huh? What’s wrong, transfer student? Gimme a response\~ I’m gonna feel lonely\~♪

<th>(Hmm? She may not talk much, but she isn’t heartless… Is she so desperate to complete the proposal that she hasn’t noticed me?)</th>

Hello? Hey! Transfer student~!

…Huh? What’s with that face? Did I upset you?

I’m still not used to talking to girls, so I dunno when I’m doing something wrong. If there’s something you have to say, you gotta do it out loud, okay?

Ah— Did you want me to call you by your name…? Yeah, I guess you’re not always going to be a “transfer student”…

But I’ve been calling you that for so long that it’s kinda awkward to change it now, if you get what I mean…♪

A-Alright alright, okay! Quit making that face! You’re making me look like a bully~!

“Anzu”! How’s that? Has your request been satisfied, ma'am?[^1]

Mmm… You tend to get fixated on the weirdest things…

You may look the pushover type, but you’re actually really stubborn… Like right now — you’re trying to do your best to plan this S1 event without relying on anyone.

But I’m telling you, it’s impossible to plan an entire S1 event all on your own.

It’s the highest ranking DreamFes, excluding SS. The amount of people and funds you need for this event is insane.

Rely on us as much as you want. You help us out a lot, so we wanna help you when you're in trouble, too.

Sooo, you see these documents? I went over them earlier, so I know what they’re talking about. Read this first, and ask me anything you’re not sure of.

If it’s too tiring to read it all, then I’ll explain in simple words.

Can I sit next to you? Alright, I’m sitting down, then~♪

Hm? What do you mean, “is it all right for you to help me out”?

Yeah, why not? Trickstar hasn’t been able to meet up, and our schedules never align…

We haven’t really made any progress — it’s like we’ve reached a wall.

Not to mention other units are getting better and better in the meantime, so they keep taking most of the jobs.

It’s great that everyone’s been way more motivated to work, and that there’s more activity happening in the school, but…

I feel like us Trickstar have strayed off the path… It just feels weird, like there’s a lack of communication.

To be fair, I’ve been really busy with Student Council, and it’s taking up all my time just to get things done… Then an S1 event comes in just when I thought the work was slowing down.

Now the entire Student Council has been scrambling to get through the procedures and preparations.

To be honest, my work as an idol is *this* close to becoming second priority… This isn’t good…

The Vice-Prez is doing ten times more than I am — it’s incredible how he still manages to work as an idol without ruining his health.

Wait, now all I’m doing is complaining. My bad, Anzu. I came here to help you, but—

It’s weird, talking to you just gets me pouring out all my worries.

Maybe this means you’re a truly excellent producer… Even more than I thought.

…Woah— Why're you suddenly teary-eyed!? Sorry, am I annoying you?

No? It’s 'cause you don’t get why you were tasked to plan an S1 event? You’re still an amateur who doesn’t know anything?

I dunno… I bet the Student Council Prez and Vice-Prez have some reason behind it all… But I’m just an underling; there’s no way I’d know what they’re thinking.

Either way, I doubt they’re trying to be mean to you out of hatred, or anything like that. I know you’re anxious about how tough this is, and it must feel like you could collapse at any moment, but it’ll all be okay.

We’ll be here to support you. We’ll protect you no matter what happens, so stay strong, and keep smiling.

And then we’ll bring about another miracle that’s unique to you — No, unique to *us*; all while having fun.

Isara-dono~☆

{% bubble Mao %}
Woah—!! You surprised me… What’s wrong, Sengoku? Need something?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shinobu v2 %}
Not at all! I just happened to spot you, so I came rushing over to you out of excitement~♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mao %}
What are you, a little kid? This is the library, so don’t make too much noise, okay? Although, I was chatting away just now, so I shouldn’t be talking…

You’re pretty energetic and peppy for a ninja, y’know.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shinobu v2 %}
A<em>hem</em>. That is because I am still a novice!

…Oh? Is that Anzu-dono next to you, Isara-dono?

My apologies! You were enjoying a date together! I apologize for being a ninja who cannot read the mood! I will take my leave right away~!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mao %}
I-I-It’s not a date!! I was just helping her with her work!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shinobu v2 %}
Oh…? Work? Anzu-dono, you always seem to be working…

Please take care of your health as much as you can. It is easy to catch a cold nowadays, you know?

Mggh!? W-wha—Anzu-dono? Please do not hug me~!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mao %}
C’mon, Anzu. Trying to heal yourself through Sengoku is understandable and all, but you can’t go and hug guys just like that.

…You’re so lucky, Sengoku.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shinobu v2 %}
You just confessed your true thoughts! I suppose even you would be in puberty, Isara-dono!

Uninini\~!!! Ninjas are not mascot characters, so I do not have any aspiration to heal people\~!

H-Help me, Isara-dono~!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mao %}
Ahaha, if she gets pumped back into working, then I guess there’s nothing wrong with her caressing cute things~ There’s no way I’m ever gonna win against kids and little animals, huh…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shinobu v2 %}
I am neither a kid nor a little animal! Hmph! And here I thought that at least *you* had accepted me as a splendid ninja~!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mao %}
Sorry, sorry. Anyway, are you free? The Vice-Prez told me about something called the “Underground Archives,” you see.

I wanna get some documents from there, so I’d like your help, if that’s alright.

You’re good at stuff like that, right…? Like, “going on a manhunt to find treasure” stuff.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shinobu v2 %}
Huh? “Underground Archives”? That has quite the exciting feel to it~! ☆

Wahoo~! I have been waiting for a ninja-sounding mission like this!

I mean! If it is alright with you, I would love to help you out, Isara-dono!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mao %}
Yeah? Thanks, Sengoku.

…Right, I’m gonna go and get some other documents. You try and keep at it with the planning, Anzu.

You’ll be okay! You can do it if you try! Go for it, go for it~! ♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shinobu v2 %}
Indeed! Go for it, go for it~! ♪
