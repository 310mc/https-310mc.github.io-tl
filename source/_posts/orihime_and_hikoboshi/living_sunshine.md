{% bubble Chiaki %}
Fuhahahahaha!

Sorry for making you wait, guys! Morisawa Chiaki has been revived in all his splendid glory! ☆
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata v2 %}
shinkai kanata has also been revived, as an extra~♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki %}
You're not an extra, Kanata! A star can't take shape if one section is missing!

Each comrade is important and irreplaceable — the five of us together are Ryuseitai…!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata v2 %}
chiaki…! ☆ <em><th>(hugs him)</th></em>
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki %}
Kanata…! ☆ <em><th>(hugs back)</th></em>
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora %}
Sometimes you two act so close it's kinda gross…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
Yeah… It's really overbearing…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shinobu %}
Ahaha, but I am relieved to see them back. Is your health alright now, Taichou-dono?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki %}
Yep! No problems whatsoever! Actually, I’d already recovered a few days ago, but the doctor insisted that I rest, and refrain from making physical contact with anyone.

There was an infectious disease going around in my area, so they were worried I might have been infected too.[^1]

That’s why I had to be somewhere far from anyone, so I wouldn't spread it to any of you guys.

But then, they did another check up for me and absolutely confirmed I have no symptoms of the disease, so don't worry! I've completely recovered! Sorry for leaving you all alone!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
No, it would've been way more bothersome if you came over while you were feeling sick…

Anyway, I get why *you* weren’t around, but why didn't Shinkai-senpai show up?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata v2 %}
ufufu~ i am sorry, was it lonely?

you see, chiaki kept trying to come and see you three, no matter how many times people told him not to go…

so i had no choice but to abduct and confine him.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora %}
Uh— Huh!? What did you just say!?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata v2 %}
i abducted and confined him~♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki %}
You won’t get away with it by saying it cutely! It’s still a crime! You little~ you shouldn't abduct and confine someone without consent, okay? Promise me that!

Gosh, honestly… I heard that there was a dispute in Kanata's home, so I got worried and went over to check how he was doing…

Then he grabbed me and locked me up there for the whole week.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shinobu %}
Huh!? W-were you okay!?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki %}
Yeah. I wasn't allowed to go outside, but there were no other constraints.

Kanata's home is isolated — I felt like I was living the life of Urashima Tarou when he stayed in the Dragon Palace.[^2]
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata v2 %}
fufufu\~ sea breams and flounders showed him a dance~[^3] <em>puka puka\~♪</em>
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki %}
Heheh. The people in his home treat him very preciously, like a god, so they didn't like it when he was around me…

…Did I end up causing you trouble, Kanata?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata v2 %}
not at all~ it would have been much more troublesome if you died from illness. let me save you every once in a while… hero~♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora %}
Ahhh… Morisawa-senpai didn't listen to what the doctor said and tried to come over, and so Shinkai-senpai did whatever he could to stop him. I see.

Good work, Senpai~♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori awkward %}
For real, good work… Gosh, Morisawa-senpai's *such* a handful…♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki %}
What!? I'm the victim here, but you're talking to me like I'm the one who did something wrong!

But you're right! I should be listening to what my doctor says!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata v2 %}
that's right~ and you got to experience a pretty good life in there — i almost want you to thank me.

fufu, i always have to do beach opening ceremonies in summer, which is a nuisance, but i felt much happier with chiaki around.

if you are okay with it, you could live in my home forever, chiaki~♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki %}
Ah, no… I'm from a middle class family — a luxurious life like that isn't for me. It'd just turn me rotten.

That aside! I tried to get in touch with Sengoku behind Kanata's back, and I got the gist of what's happened to you guys! You did a very good job holding yourselves up for the week!

But don't worry! We're here now! ☆
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
Oh…? Sengoku-kun, you were contacting Morisawa-senpai?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shinobu %}
Well, it was more like, we were not receiving any communication from him, so I got worried and started searching for information.

Every day I would attempt to search after practice… I was always tired by then, but I tried my best to keep pressing on for whatever could be found.

I thought Shinkai-dono would know something, so I gathered my courage to go and visit his home. And then, before me appeared Taichou-dono… I was very surprised to see him there.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki %}
Hahaha, it saved you the trouble of searching for me.

Yeah, my phone was confiscated by then and I couldn't really figure out what was going on outside, so Sengoku prepared a ninja-like method of communication for the two of us.

Every day, we’d secretly bury a letter in the ground for the other to find and read.

Ninja skills are incredible, huh? They really come in handy during emergencies. I'll keep appointing you that role in the future, Sengoku.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shinobu %}
Ahaha, I am happy to know my ninja techniques were useful for once! I usually never have the chance to apply them in real life.
{% endbubble %}

## Chapter 2

{% bubble Shinobu %}
Heheh, my apologies, everyone…

We were told that we should do our best without relying on Taichou-dono. Thus, I hid the fact that I was contacting him.

I did so because we are spoiled rotten by Taichou-dono, you see…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
It's fine, really… Though I think I would've liked it if you told us he was doing okay… I couldn't really focus properly in practice from worrying…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki %}
Ho*ho*, is that so! I was a little nervous you might not care about me, since you have absolutely zero manner points towards me, but you *do* love me as a comrade, huh! ☆
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
Will you shut up… It’s so suffocating… I wish you didn't come back until summer was over…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki %}
Heheh, that aside… After I’d recuperated, I practiced with Kanata. We should be able to perform properly in the event.

Still, I’ve only just recovered. I might slip up a bit, so be easy on me!

Actually, no— Let's do our best together, as we always do, Ryuseitai! *All for one, one for all!*
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
Yeah, yeah… You really are feeling better… It’s a relief to see you back to your usual self, alright?

Us three just can't do well without both of you here…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora %}
But we *did* manage to get through it by ourselves. We practiced really hard with Trickstar.

In fact, you two might’ve been in the way if you were around. I kinda *wanted* you to stay away~♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki %}
What did you just say, you little rascal\~!! I’m not giving away my chance on the stage! I've been yearning to stand on top of it this whole time, you know\~!

I'll be up there no matter what it takes! I'll shine as part of Ryuseitai!

Fuhahaha! I'm all pumped! So, what do you guys want to do now? We should probably make sure our steps are synchronized… Want to rehearse together for a bit?

You're the center of the show this time, so we'll do things just as you say!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora %}
Ah, yeah. I'd love to, but we’ve been left to take care of a stall. We need to tidy it up, and then ask a vendor to take over. We can start rehearsing after that.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki %}
Ohh, you're doing a stall again!? I feel like it's become a custom of ours now!

It's just like Ryuseitai! I like it! Ahh, this brings me back… Mikejima-san used to invite me to help out in stalls pretty often, last year…♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata v2 %}
yes, he used to invite me to festivals too when we were young. that is the only thing about him that has not changed since he was a child.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shinobu %}
Hmm? I do not quite get it, but…

We are going to be selling Trickstar merchandise, as thanks for their guidance this event.

We would like to sell a lot, and repay them with the profits.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
Heheheh, Trickstar stuff is so cute… Anzu-san made them all…

I got a sample of “Orihime-kun and Hikoboshi-chan”[^4]…♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki %}
Orihime and Hikoboshi? That's definitely Tanabata-related, but it doesn't really have anything to do with Trickstar!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata v2 %}
where *is* trickstar right now? we would like to thank them for taking care of you three.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora %}
Ah… Anzu-san is struggling a lot with the preparations — there’s still some left to do even now, so I think they're helping her out.

They're super busy setting out the bamboo for the tanzaku[^5], and making food…

It looks like they can get rewarded so well for it, they won't even need to get up onstage.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki %}
Hm. That wouldn't be a reward in their eyes. Those kids always want to be up on the stage.

That's the same for us! We can't be shoddy with our stall work! Let's work together and do our absolute best!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora %}
Ossu! Of course! Let's pump up and do this! After all, we're the main show this time!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
Are we really…? Everyone here is so into this event… It's said that it has the most participating units ever…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shinobu %}
Ahaha. We have to work hard, or we will be buried by everyone else~
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata v2 %}
okay, then let's do that. it will be okay, the five of us together are invincible~♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki %}
Yep! Well said, Kanata! We've got a new catchphrase for ourselves! I'll carve it in my heart! Fuhahahahaha!! ☆
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
Morisawa-senpai, you've been at maximum hyper for a while now…

Not only will you drag us down if your health gets bad again, but you're also really annoying when you're like that, so please don’t move around so energetically…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki %}
I feel like that “annoying” bit was a little too much! Or should I say, it’s saddening! But! I’m aware! I'll never let myself get sick or collapse ever again!

I'll never separate myself from you guuuuuysss!! ☆
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shinobu %}
Ack\~! Please don't hug me! The summer is like hell itself — it's so sweaty and hot\~!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata v2 %}
then let's bathe in the water\~♪ it will relieve you and make you feel refreshed\~
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora %}
Where'd you get that bucket from, Shinkai-senpai!? I see water in there — If you dump that on us we'll *all* get sick!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
Ahaha… It's finally gone right back to usual… What a relief…♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shinobu %}
Indeed~

It was tense, but we were able to work hard practicing with Trickstar, and were able to gain many things out of it.

However, when it comes to the stage, I will prefer to simply be with my comrades in Ryuseitai! I feel like I could do anything with all of you by my side… No, more than that — it feels like any wish could come true in that moment!
{% endbubble %}

## Chapter 3

{% note cw %}
**Content Warning:** The following chapters contain jokes about sexual harrassment.
{% endnote %}

{% img /img/es/eventstory/orihimeandhikoboshi/maoorigcg.jpg %}

{% bubble Mao %}
Right, this should be good.

Whatcha think, Anzu? Is it looking a little more like Tanabata now~?

Ahaha, you’re making an OK sign; guess that means it’s all good?

You gotta tell me properly~ There's tanzaku and leaves all around me, so I can't see you well, y’know~?

I love your voice. I feel at ease when I hear it. You don’t talk much, but when you do, it feels like you say lots of meaningful things.

I don't wanna miss out on anything you say, so talk to me in a clear voice. It’ll make me happy.

Ahaha. “Never mind that, just get down”?

Alright, alright~ Back in spring, you used to get nervous whenever you tried to reply to us, but nowadays you just let it all out, huh~?

That just means you’re growing up, too. Mhm, you’re now like a confident, reliable mom~♪

Woah woah—!! Don’t shake the step ladder!! Oh no, no, no—!! I’m sorry, I’m sorry!

Please don’t be angry, Anzu-san!! You don’t speak when you’re mad, so it’s even more terrifying, y’know!?

L-Let’s calm down now! You can’t hurt an idol right before their performance — You’d fail as a producer if you did that, wouldn’t you?

Ah, the shaking stopped. Ahaha, yep, the best way to stop you is by aiming from *that* angle~♪

…Hm? What’s wrong, Anzu? You look like you’re about to cry…!?

S-Sorry for teasing you! I shouldn’t crack jokes with you as if I’m talking to a guy, right!? I’m really sorry for being inconsiderate!

Ughh, I wanna prostrate and apologize to you, but I can’t! I’m still on top of the ladder!

…Huh? You’re going to be okay? You sure~?

Don’t push yourself so hard… You don’t have to hold it in. If there’s something you wanna say, go ahead and say it. I’m kinda dense, so… I’ll only get it if you tell me.

Hm… “I really might fail as a producer”? Why do you say that?

You’re amazing, y’know? You properly managed a DreamFes this huge.

I bet it’ll be a success, beyond everyone’s imagination. Even this event’s client’ll love it.

The performances haven’t even started yet, but there’s already so many people bustling around the place. This is the first time it’s ever been this busy, y’know? This is all thanks to *you* and *your* accomplishments.

You’re amazing, Anzu. It’s admirable. No one thinks of you as an *“amateur producer”* anymore.

They acknowledge you as a respectable person, who can guide us all.

So c’mon, don’t make that face. Don’t talk about yourself that way. Be more proud of yourself~ This is something worth boasting about.

…Anzu? Uh!? Are you crying for real now!?

H-Hold on, I’ll climb down right now! Just gimme a sec—Woah—!!

<th>(Crap, no!! I rushed too much — I’m losing my balance! I’m gonna fall…!)</th>

<th>(Ahh, no, you—! She leaped forward — Is she trying to catch me so I won’t get hurt…?)</th>

<th>(No, I’m okay! I can land just fine, so back away!)</th>

<th>(—Ack!! I’m gonna crash into her!!)</th>

…Gffh—! S-Sorry, Anzu! I’ll get off you immediately!

<th>(Woah… Was a girl’s body always this warm and soft…)</th>

<th>(Wait—This isn’t the time to be fascinated by this.)</th>

<th>(I hear footsteps—!! Oh no, this is *really* bad! If someone saw us like this—)</th>
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Subaru %}
Yooo, Sally~! You done with your work? Ryuseitai asked us if we could rehearse with them while we still have time, so—

Ooh?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mao %}
……………

…Um. It’s not what you think, Subaru. This was all an accident. Please believe me.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Subaru %}
Hey, guys… Come over here. Sally~ pushed Anzu down.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Hokuto %}
What!? Have you gone mad, Isara!? It doesn't matter if it's you — that's still unforgivable!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Makoto %}
Isara-kun… You’re awful…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mao %}
Nooo!! It really was an accident! Don't look at me like that! Dammit, how does this keep happening to me…!

C’mon, Anzu! Don't laugh! Tell them the truth!!

<th>(…Huh? I thought she was crying, but she’s actually smiling? Was I just imagining her cry…?)</th>

<th>(……?)</th>
{% endbubble %}

## Chapter 4

{% bubble Mao %}
Um, I'll get off of you now, so… A-Are you hurt anywhere?

…I’m begging you! Please don't sue me!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Subaru %}
Oooh, there it is! Sally~'s specialty! The most magnificent prostration we’ve seen all summer! ☆
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Makoto %}
Heheh. You can pretty much tell it was an accident, anyway. The step ladder’s tipped over.

But someone could’ve seen this… Both of you could’ve gotten hurt, so be more careful, okay?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Hokuto %}
Y-yeah, we can't let that happen.

…Was it really alright, Anzu? Isara didn't go on a puberty-induced rampage, did he?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mao %}
Hokuto~!? You're the least likely to be interested in this stuff, yet *you’re* the one who doesn't believe me!?

Ughh… What did I ever do to you guys… Whatever, it’s fine… Anzu thankfully seems alright, at least…

Hm? What is it, Anzu? You’re sorry?

Ah, nah. There’s no need to apologize, or well, I feel lucky that I got to touch something I’ve barely touched before…?

In fact, I wanna thank you for it…!

Owowow! Don’t pull my hair out!! That’s not what you’re talking about?

…You’re sorry for almost crying?

It’s fine, though. If you don’t cry while you still can, you might grow up suppressing your feelings, so~

If you ever have any worries, go ahead and talk to us about it.

We’ll always be your by your side, no matter what. So rely on us, Anzu.

Ahaha, there’s still preparation work left to do even on the day of the event, so in your eyes, you’re not doing good enough?

Not only that, but now you need us idols to help you finish everything up?

That’s why you feel like you’ve failed as a producer?

So that’s what it was. Well, if you yourself aren’t satisfied, then nothing anyone tells you will be able to change that.

But, honestly… What’s wrong with that? We’ve also failed a bunch of times while working with Ryuseitai.

You’ve been super busy lately; taking care of other units, and working on a huge job like this…

It kinda feels like you’ve grown apart from us.

But somehow, I’m kinda happy that we’ve been stressing out and fumbling about at the same time.

Makes me happy, like we’re connected…… Sorry, I can’t say it like how it’s done in manga.

Let’s keep growing together. We might trip and lose our way sometimes, maybe we’ll take a detour — But even then, let’s keep going forward without ever giving up. We can do that together, no matter where we are.

We can’t really walk side by side together anymore, like how we used to in spring, but…

It feels like you’re always beside me — Your hard work makes *me* wanna work harder…

If I keep going while thinking that, we’ll eventually be able to stand on the same stage again, won’t we?

We’ll surely be able to stand side by side with you, in a much brighter, sparkling, amazing future.

That’s what I believe… I can be satisfied just knowing that.

I mean, Orihime and Hikoboshi are happy enough just knowing they can rendezvous once per year, aren’t they? It’s the same as that.

…Ahh, man! I really can’t say it right! Ahaha! ♪
{% endbubble %}

{% img /img/es/eventstory/orihimeandhikoboshi/living4_1.jpg %}

{% bubble Shinobu %}
Isara-dono~! I mean— Everyone from Trickstar! We have acquired a place for our rehearsals, so I will take you over there! ♪

…Wait! Isara-dono and Anzu-dono are having a moment again! I apologize for being a ninja who just cannot read the mood! I will take my leave right away~!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mao %}
Wait, wait! You’re misunderstanding again! We were just bonding as friends, y’know…!?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shinobu %}
Nay! You need not to explain it to me, I understand what it is. I am not a child.

What comes after bonding as friends is—

Wha—? Anzu-dono? Why are you tugging at my clothes?

Huh? You are worried about my clothes seam? W-wait! I would rather you fix it after I have removed my clothes! I do not want to be pricked by the needle! It is scary~!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Makoto %}
Ahaha, you're already wearing your outfit for the event, Shinobu-kun? Anzu-chan also designed that, right?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shinobu %}
Heh~♪ That is correct! She has carefully crafted it!

Each and every part is different in some way — It is extremely elaborate! Truly respectable!

Oh, also! Taichou-dono and Shinkai-dono have finally arrived, so we shall begin rehearsal once we have tried out our outfits!

What do you think~? Does it suit me?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Makoto %}
Ahaha, it totally does~ Cute, very cute~♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shinobu %}
Eek! Do not pat my head! I had my hair arranged!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Subaru %}
But if you're gonna be rehearsing, won't it just get messy anyway? Your choreography has lots of vigorous dance moves, so~

You guys modelled it after kung fu like us, right?[^6]
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shinobu %}
Indeed we did. It even ended up being too similar to your performance, so we have also taken ideas from Kenpo[^7], since Tetora-kun knows it well.

In the end, we could not really figure out something for ourselves…

We were practicing with you Trickstar the whole time, and ended up being influenced by your choreography.

But, if you think it is a problem, then there is still time to make changes.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Hokuto %}
No, it's alright. It's customary for us and our opponents to play by the same rules. And no matter what the premise, or who we’re up against, we will always come out victorious.

Not only that — we're capable of firing up our own radiance. That is “Trickstar.”
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shinobu %}
Sooo cool! ♪ This is why I really respect all of you! I am truly grateful for all that you have done for us this event!

Please watch us, as we take in your guidance — your radiance — and shine brilliantly! We will make sure you do not regret accompanying us for all those days!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Subaru %}
Mm, we’re looking forward to it. Let's do our best in the event, Ryuseitai~♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shinobu %}
Yes! Let us both! As two units that bear stars in our names, we shall become the bridge to bright, shining dreams — we shall become the Milky Way!
