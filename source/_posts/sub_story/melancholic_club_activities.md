{% bubble Hajime %}
Thank you for your hard work on class duty, Tomoya-kun. Do you have anything at the Drama Club today?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tomoya %}
Nah. I was actually just thinking about whether I should head home or check out the shopping center.

What about you, Hajime? We haven’t been walking home together lately unless we have something to do as Ra*bits, soo~ Come and join me if you have nothing going on.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Hajime %}
Heheh, the Tea Club has the day off today, so I also have free time. I’ll accompany you anywhere~♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori sad3 %}
…………
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tomoya surprised %}
Woah, Takamine…!? At least say something if you’re gonna get so close to us…

Mmmrph—!?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori worried %}
Shh, shhh…! Please, *please* don’t speak so loudly…!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki hidden %}
Heeey, Takamine! Where did you go\~! Come on out wherever you are\~!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori worried %}
Eeek!? He’s already here…!?

N-Neither of you tell him I’m here, please…! I’m begging you…!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tomoya sigh %}
Phew…! Ahh jeez, don’t cover my mouth outta nowhere…

…Wait, huh?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Hajime worried %}
Takamine-kun went to hide under the teacher’s desk~ He seemed really frightened, so let’s not talk to him for now.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tomoya %}
Got it… He looked like he was freaking out. Maybe something awful happened and he’s now running away from it?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki %}
Takamine! There you are! Let’s go play basketball and shed the sweat of youth once more…☆

Wait, huh? Umm, you two are in Ra*bits, right? Is it just the two of you here?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tomoya awkward %}
Y-Yes. Umm, are you looking for Takamine? He was here a moment ago, but left ‘cause he had something to do.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki grin %}
Mmm, so I missed him by a second. Alright, thank you for the information!

Takamine~! I’m going to make sure I find you no matter where you go! Fuhaaahahaha!! ☆
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Hajime %}
…Takamine-kun, he left. You can come out now.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori worried %}
T-Thank you… He’s extremely insistent… I’m so grateful that you managed to make him go away…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tomoya %}
Don’t sweat it — it’s just what classmates would do for each other.

Anyway, that guy’s a third year, right? Is he chasing after you ‘cause you messed up somehow?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori sigh %}
No, he just comes over to pick me up from class every time we have club practice, and it’s super annoying… so I had to run away…

Ughhh, it’s already bad enough that we’re in the same unit together — why does he have to pester me when it comes to the club, too… so depressing…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Hajime awkward %}
Erm, I think you should go to your club, though… Didn’t you join it because you like basketball?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori frown %}
Not at all… I was just invited by Morisawa-senpai, and had no choice but to join… I don’t actually have any drive to play…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tomoya %}
Oh yeah, ‘cause it’s mandatory to participate in club activities in Yumenosaki… I think there’s plenty of guys like you who had no choice but to join one.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Hajime %}
Oh, I see~ Personally, I joined the Tea Club because I always liked tea.

I’m always feeling excited all day whenever it’s time for the club to get together~♪

Our club president is very kind, and he’s always teaching me how to properly brew tea. He even brings over such delicious sweets…

He’s perfect at the job — sometimes I feel like I’m being served at someone’s house.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori worried %}
*Sigh*, I’m so jealous… Our team captain is like *that*, so… I just feel suffocated and annoyed and frustrated…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tomoya frown %}
I know exactly how you feel. Well, no — ours isn’t suffocating or anything, but he’s so extreme with everything he does…

I would’ve quit instantly if Hokuto-senpai wasn’t around.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori serious %}
You sure talk about him a lot… Oh yeah, I think there were a few Trickstar members in the Basketball Club, too…?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tomoya awkward %}
Hold up, you only *vaguely* remember your club members…? Oh well, I guess you haven’t been there for that long… I know who’s in mine ‘cause there’s only three of us in the club.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori curious %}
Huh? Only three…? Can you still do club activities with that amount of people…?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tomoya frown %}
Dunno… I was told we’ll be doing something soon enough, so something should start happening in the club.

And actually, there were way more first years at first, but they all ran away thanks to that masked freak. I’m the only one left.

…Like I said, if Hokuto-senpai wasn’t there, I would’ve ran away myself.

That’s just how mentally tiring it is to be alone with that masked freak.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tomoya smile %}
But Hokuto-senpai’s always covering for me and encouraging me, and he’s so cool—

The masked freak may be a weirdo, but I respect Hokuto-senpai from the bottom of my heart~♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori sad4 %}
Oh, *what*… You may be complaining, but you’re also enjoying your club in the end…

I’m not enjoying it at all… Not my club, nor my unit, nor my school life… I’m going through the gloomiest youth…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Hajime worried %}
Awawa, please cheer up~!

To be fair, I’m not always having fun at the club—

Sometimes I feel really stressed, or rather, I get very nervous when it’s my turn to brew tea for my club members.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tomoya %}
Yeah, I get nervous when I have to perform an act in front of Hokuto-senpai. I do get complimented, but there are waaay too many times I’ve messed up.

But he’s always clearly explaining to me how to improve my acting — it makes me wanna practice even harder and meet his expectations.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Hajime %}
I know what you mean~! I’ve made mistakes before, but they always tell me what to do.

They praise me whenever I’m lacking in confidence, and it made me want to work harder to brew better tea~♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori northinking %}
Ah—…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tomoya curious %}
What’s up, Takamine? Did something come to mind for you, too?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori srsthinking %}
Ummm… I’m new to basketball… So I’m always just standing there, without a single clue on what I’m supposed to do…

That’s when Morisawa-senpai tells me to go for the shot… I just throw it without thought, and it doesn’t get anywhere near the goal, as you’d expect…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori sigh2 %}
But he still praises me for it… Telling me that I’ll be able to do it next time, to practice hard and go for it again…

I get annoyed from all his blabbering… so there was once a time when I tried shaking him off by throwing the ball randomly, and managed to score a goal…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori awkward %}
That moment felt so exhilarating that… I *might* have found basketball fun to play…?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki grin %}
I see, I see! You really *were* having fun with us, then!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori surprised %}
Eep— M-Morisawa-senpai? W-Why’re you here…!?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki grin %}
A hero will always come rushing to the person who calls for him! ☆

…That was only a joke — I just couldn’t find you no matter where I looked, so I tried going back to places I’ve checked before.

Then I heard your voice from your class, and came rushing before I knew it!

I see now, so you’ve finally realized the joy of basketball. I’m so happy~ Today will be a basketball day to commemorate! ☆

Now then, let’s head off! Let’s enjoy a sparkling youth together! ☆
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori shocked %}
Eeek— Stop, don’t grab the back of my collar~! S-S-Save me, you twooo…!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Hajime %}
Please do your best, Takamine-kun!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tomoya %}
Break a leg, Takamine!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori frown %}
Arghh, dammit — Don’t just *stand* there…!

I wish I never said anything if it was gonna end like this…!!
