{% bubble Subaru %}
Alrighty, here I goo~☆
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki niyaclosed %}
Yeah, come on now! Bring it on, Akehoshi! Try to defeat me! Go for the shot, I’ll take on the challenge! I’ll take everything you’ve got… ☆
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Subaru sigh %}
Uwah, he’s so obnoxious… Chi~chan-buchou’s always like this when he’s on defense…[^1]

It’s kinda gross, so paaass~☆
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki grin2 %}
Don’t run away, Akehoshi! Aren’t you a boy!? Face me head on! Strike me with everything you’ve got…☆
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Subaru surprised %}
Woah— Why’s he chasing me!? I don’t have the ball anymore! Gaaah, he’s so annoyiiing!!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori worried0 %}
Woah—

I caught the ball, but what am I supposed to do with it now…?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mao surprised %}
Huhh!? You haven’t picked up the rules by now, Takamine? Even though you give off a top-notch basketball player vibe…

But right, you’re still a beginner, huh…? Well, for now, you could try to overtake me while dribbling the ball, or you could try shooting a goal from where you’re standing.

You gotta decide fast, ‘cause it goes against the rules to hold the ball for too long~
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori sad %}
You said it way too quickly for me to get it… Uhh…?

I dunno what to do anymore… Ahh, at this point, I just wanna die holding this ball…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Subaru surprised %}
Takamin, get out of the way\~! Chi\~chan-senpai’s chasing me with a serious look on his face for some reason\~!!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori worried0 %}
Woah—! Could you please not charge towards me…?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki grin2 %}
Yes, that’s it! That’s perfect, Takamine! With your tall stature, you can easily overpower the enemy team just by standing there!

Absolutely wonderful! We’ll call it: “Takamine Barricade”…☆
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mao frown %}
Ahh, stop, stop.

Could we take a break here, Buchou? I feel so worn out all of a sudden…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki %}
Mhm! Following Isara’s words is surely the right course! I just know it!

Right then, everyone, let’s rest while we pray for the peace of the Earth…☆
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori sigh %}
Is praying for the peace of the Earth seriously necessary right now…? I don’t get it at all… I wanna die…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mao grin %}
Great work, everyone\~ Make sure to wipe your sweat off with a towel, so your body doesn’t get cold\~♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Subaru nod %}
It’s sooo obvious that Sally\~’s way more club captain-like, don’t you think? Way more than that pervert over there\~…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki scold %}
Who’re you calling a pervert, Akehoshi!?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki grin2 %}
But I forgive you! If you want to know why, it’s because I love you…☆
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Subaru hmphright %}
I *don’t* love you, so could you not get near me please~? Shoo, shoo!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mao sigh %}
Please get along, all of you… seriously…

Mm-oh? The transfer student is here.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Subaru %}
Ah, you’re right! Yahoo, transfer student! Do you have something with the Basketball Club~?

Hm, hm… You plan to sell candid photos of us Trickstar in order to fund our activities~?

That’s why you came here to take photos of us in our daily lives…? Oh yeah, Hokke~ mentioned something similar the other day, I think?

I completely forgot about that! Take a cool photo of me, okay? Sparkle~☆ *<th>(winks)</th>*
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mao %}
We’re fine with it, but Makoto doesn’t really like being photographed, so make sure to be lenient on him. That being said… Can we even make money off of our photos~?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki grin2 %}
Not to worry! If there are any unsold photos, I’ll buy them all up! I’ll even decorate my whole room with your photos and admire them every day!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Subaru yare %}
Can the pervert stop talking before it gets any grosser~?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mao %}
Well, I personally don’t mind anyone buying them as long as they sell out. We might get a modeling job someday, so how about we take up her offer as a practice for it?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Subaru %}
Yeah, let’s do it! What sorta pose should I make? Like this? Or maybe like this?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mao %}
Well, they’re candid photos, so… Instead of posing, we should let her take pictures of us going about our “daily lives” — stuff fans wouldn’t usually see, yeah?

So let’s just take it easy and move along the way we usually do~♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Subaru %}
Huh, really? You sure know everything, Sally~ You’re always teaching me so much! ☆
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mao grin %}
You can stay as the “natural airhead”~ I’ll do the thinking for all the tricky stuff.

…Woah, Takamine. It’s best you stand a little further away, y’know?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori worried0 %}
Why…?

Did I do something upsetting…? <em>Sigh</em>, I wanna die…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mao worried %}
Nah, I just mean that you’re not part of Trickstar, so…

It’ll be a problem if you got your photo taken without permission, and even <em>sold</em> on top of it… Well, I guess those sorta photos can just be filtered out and removed later, though.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki fist %}
It’s fine, she can take photos of Takamine and I as well! Let’s sell candid photos of Ryuseitai, too! Feel free to take many pictures of us, Transfer student! ♪

This is the “justice” pose! This is the “courage” pose!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori cryalmost %}
And this is the “I wanna die” pose…♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mao yare %}
I <em>just</em> said you don’t have to pose, though… Well, whatever.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mao grin %}
This is our daily life here, so… I hope you can get some nice pictures out of this.

Nishishi. Keep taking those photos, Transfer student~♪

## Translation Notes

[^1]: Buchou is a title to refer to “club captain”. For this line, Subaru says <em>buchou</em> for Chiaki instead of what he usually says, which is <em>senpai</em>.
