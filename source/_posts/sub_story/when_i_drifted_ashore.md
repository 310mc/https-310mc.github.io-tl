*puka, puka…♪*

oh? hello, anzu-san.

what a [coincidence]\~ i am so [happy] to see you, fufufu\~♪

did you go to the [hospital] for [something]? are you feeling unwell? is it a [summer cold]~?

that is no good~ you need to be more careful. it is [important] for both [idols] and [producers] to take care of their health.

—is what chiaki would probably say here\~ ehehe\~♪

hm? you are fine? full of [energy]? is that you flexing your [biceps]?

fufufu, you do some [adorable] things sometimes, anzu-san~…♪

ohh, an acquaintance is in the [hospital], so you came to [visit] them?

but you yourself are in [good health]…?

i am so glad~♪ the [best] thing for children is to be full of energy.

hm? ah, yes… i am also still a [child]. i am a [high school] student, after all. i am aware.

it is truly a [blessing] to be a [child], yes?

ah! do not worry. i am not [sick] or anything.

i would not catch a [cold] by [soaking] in water during this [season], after all.

since it is [summer] now~ fufufu, the [sun] is out a lot~… ♪

so, you see… i am not [good] with [humidity], so i was [soaking] myself a little in the [ocean].

that was when i got stung by a [man-of-war].[^1]

mm? oh, you do not know of it? it is a [dangerous jellyfish]; quite long, too.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata ehe %}
fufufu, it is a terrifying [jellyfish], almost as if it is an [alien] that was created to [kill] humans.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata sigh3 %}
i let my [guard] down, thinking that it would be safe in this [season]… it was quite a [huge mistake] coming from me~

fufufu, it seems that they have increased in population [massively] around the [area], likely because of the [abnormal] weather changes.

the earth is becoming [stranger] due to the [effects] of the [environmental pollution]. gosh, what an inconvenience.

though, it is also interesting in its own way, as there have been [many] strange [fishies] emerging from the change…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata v2 %}
and lately, i am quite enthusiastic about collecting all those [mutant] marine animals.

i [catch] any weird fishie, and then [take care] of them over at the [marine life clubroom]~

please come [see] them for yourself if you are ever interested, okay?

fufu, i even made a [stuffed toy] based on [one] of them. since i had [nothing] better to do while i was in the [hospital].

i will give one to you, anzu-san. here you go… please give it a lot of love~♪

hm? midori would be much more [happy] with a stuffed toy…?

that is true~ he seems to like [mascot characters], after all.

i think he likely sees me as [one], as well… so whenever he is tired, he [automatically] comes to hug me.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata awkward %}
being touched is something i was not very [comfortable] with…

it used to cause me [stress], but… lately, there are times when it makes me [happy].
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata v2 %}
it is strange, isn’t it? fufufu, maybe i am also becoming [strange] from the [abnormal] weather changes?

oh, i am so sorry. i just kept [talking] endlessly…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata sigh2 %}
i was locked up in the [hospital room] for a long time, so i grew lonely, you see.

the [man-of-war]’s poison has faded, so i am perfectly [fine] by now, but… my household is a bit [overprotective].
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata serious %}
hm? i am [cherished] by my family…?

well, that is because i am a very, very important [living god].
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata smile2 %}
fufu, more importantly… anzu-san, are you hungry?

the [worshipers] brought me many [gifts]. lots of [fruit] and [sweets]…

but i am not [fond] of the food much, and i cannot eat it all on my own… so please [take some] with you, anzu-san.

yes, you can eat some of it now.

here you go, eat as much as you [like]… i will feed you, say “ahh”~♪

is it tasty?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata smile3 %}
i am so glad\~ you are finally [smiling]. you are still a child who is [growing], so please eat lots and lots\~♪

[food] rots faster in [summer], so i am [grateful] that you are eating the food for me before it [rots].

thank you, anzu-san. good girl, good girl~…♪

fufu… yes, you are right. it really has become [summer] for real now, hasn’t it?

i want to play with everyone in the [ocean] this year, too.
