{% bubble Chiaki v2 %}
Takamine! Nagumo! We’re going to play superheroes together for today! ☆
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori sigh2 %}
Hah…? Where did this come from…? Are you stupid…?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora curious %}
Actually, Taichou, aren’t we always playing around as superheroes?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki grin %}
How harsh! I had never once intended for Ryuseitai to simply be about “playing around,” y’know…?

And so, in other words — we are going to play superheroes in order to become <em>true</em> heroes!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori srsthinking %}
Umm…? I don’t get what he’s trying to say…? Do you understand, Nagumo-kun…?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora northinking %}
Mm~… Is it like <em>kata</em> training?[^1] Like, tryna get a feel of the movements before the actual match and stuff?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki grin %}
Yeah! Something like that!

You guys still don’t have enough experience or awareness as heroes, so we can’t throw you into a real battle just yet!

That is why! We’re going to start with playing superheroes together first!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori sad %}
Mmm…? What path are we heading…?

I know I’m the last person to say this, but weren’t we supposed to be aiming to be <em>idols</em>, not heroes…?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki smug3 %}
Let’s aim to be heroes, as well! Aren’t you a boy, Takamine!? You should grasp onto everything you’ve ever wanted with your very own hands!

Get yourself into the spirit like THIIIIS, and embrace everything whole! Fuhahaha! ☆
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori sigh3 %}
Could you please try to make sense when you talk…?

Ughh… This is such a paaain… Why do I have to play around as a hero when I’m in high school…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki snicker %}
Heh~♪ You’ve no time to grumble, Takamine!

In tokusatsu shows, the enemy would wait for the hero to finish transforming, but in the real world, a villain would never show such mercy!

Alright, come on in, villains! Let’s see you try to invade planet Earth…☆
{% endbubble %}

{% img /img/es/idolstory/herogame/2.jpg %}

{% bubble Kanata v2 %}
bwahaha~ we will [take over] this [earth]~…♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shinobu grin %}
Nin-nin! ♪ Once we’ve dominated the world, all of mankind shall wear ninja garments for the rest of their lives~…!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori worried %}
What’s with this comedic evil organization… Actually, wait a sec— The villains are gonna be played by Sengoku-kun and Shinkai-senpai…?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki v2 %}
Yep!

I would feel bad if I were to involve other people in such an idiotic activity, so we’ll have our unit members play as the villains instead!

By playing the villain, you can better understand the feelings of your enemies, right?

We shouldn’t impose a one-sided, biased justice! We need to properly think about what is justice and what is evil!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori v2 %}
Hold on, did you seriously <em>just</em> call this “idiotic” by yourself…

If you know how stupid this all is, then can we not do it…? I don’t wanna waste my energy over something so pointless… I wanna die…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki grin %}
Come on now, Takamine, what are you spacing out for!?

Stand up, hero! For the sake of mankind’s freedom! For the sake of the Earth’s future…! ☆
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata v2 %}
fufufu, chiaki— i mean, you over there! you must be the [boss] of the [heroes of justice], right~?

i will start with [taking] you [down] first~♪

take this\~ [industrial wastewater]…♪ it is time for [environmental pollution]\~…♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora surprised %}
He says it in such a chill and relaxed way, but his actions are insanely vicious…!?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata v2 %}
fufufu…♪ if nobody stops me now, the [ocean] will be [ruined] forever~
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata worried %}
how sad\~ is there no hero on this [planet]\~?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shinobu v2 %}
I shall assist you! Take this—! Turn corrupt by my shurikens…☆
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori sigh2 %}
I don’t get their set-up at <em>all</em>… A ninja polluting the ocean…? They’re just weirdos doing random stuff at this point…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki grin %}
Either way, it’s still a hindrance to the people! We have to stop them! It’s time to fight, Takamine!

I’ll show you how to do it, so watch closely! *Transform…!* ☆

<em><th>(humming)</th></em> Hmhm\~hmhm\~♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori surprised2 %}
Oh, so you just change normally…?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki glare %}
No peeking, Takamine! That’s lewd!
{% endbubble %}

{% img /img/es/idolstory/herogame/3.jpg %}

{% bubble Chiaki grin %}
Now then, with my transformation complete, it’s time to battle! Don’t forget your catchphrase!

The red flame is the mark of justice! The sun of life, burning bright red!

Ryusei Red, Morisawa Chiaki…☆
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori serious %}
I just realized this, but you expose your real name just fine, huh… Aren’t heroes supposed to keep their identity a secret…? Well, not that I care much…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki grin %}
C’mon, Takamine, Nagumo, you need to chang— I mean, transform, too! I’m at a disadvantage fighting all alone against two! Even I won’t be able to do much except evade their attacks!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori sigh4 %}
Um, I’d much rather that you don’t make a mess in our classroom… W-What’re we gonna do, Nagumo-kun…?
{% endbubble %}

{% img /img/es/idolstory/herogame/4.jpg %}

{% bubble Tetora serious %}
Well, we’ve got no choice but to get this done ASAP. They’ll be satisfied enough if we play along, right?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori surprised %}
Whaa, when did he change his clothes…?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora v2 %}
Ossu! The black flame is the mark of effort! The burning fighting spirit, stained with the soil of the earth!

Ryusei Black, Nagumo Tetora…! It just so happens that the Karate Club has the day off today, so for my training, I’mma go all out in this instead~♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki v2 %}
Ah! Don’t attack them directly, Nagumo! We don’t want anyone hurt!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora v2 %}
Gotcha! I’ll take on Sengoku-kun, so you defeat Shinkai-senpai, Taichou!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora blushscratch %}
Hehe! ♪ To be honest, I used to play superheroes a lot when I was young.

This takes me back~… I’d play with a couple’a boys back then, but I wonder what they’re doin’ now…

Personally, I never expected I’d do this for a job as a highschooler! ♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori sad4 %}
Uu~… I thought Nagumo-kun would understand how I feel, so I didn’t expect him to get so into it… Now what…

Ughh… Being in the same room as this bunch will just make you go crazy…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki scold %}
Ryusei Beam! Ryusei Beam!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata v2 %}
[evil] barrier~♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori shocked %}
Ah— So *that’s* how you fight…? It really is just a game for kids…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shinobu blushjoy %}
C’mon, Midori-kun, join us! It is much more fun than you would think\~ Playing superheroes has its charm, as well\~♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki grin %}
Exactly! Boys love heroes! And aren’t you a boy, too, Takamine!? You should have the burning spirit of a boy swirling within your heart!

So come, fire it up as you please! Burn up the flame of your color…☆
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori frown %}
Uu~… I seriously don’t wanna do this at <em>all</em>, but I guess it won’t matter what I say here…

Alright, fine, I’ll play along… I doubt I’d have anything to do if I went back home, anyway…

Even a dumb game works just fine as a time-killer…

*T-Transform…* One sec, I’ll go change my clothes in the hallway or something…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki scold %}
Ah—! He’s trying to get away! Not on our watch! Kanata, Sengoku, block his escape!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori surprised %}
Wh—…? Aren’t you the <em>hero</em> here? Why’re you ordering the villains around like they’re your henchmen…?

I’m not gonna run away! It’s too late for that anyway, I can’t just quit school now that I’m here…!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori sigh %}
I’ll go along with you guys as much as possible, so the least I ask is not to use any forceful tactics on me…!

Ughh, I can’t freaking take it anymore with these idiots…!
