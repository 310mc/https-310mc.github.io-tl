{% bubble Chiaki v2 %}
Alright then! It’s time to work hard and practice a lot today, as well! ☆
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki serious %}
…Well, that’s what I wanted to say, but — Unfortunately, we’ll have to cancel today’s practice!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori smile %}
Oh, I can just go home then, right…? ♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki surprised0 %}
Hold it right there! I never once said that we’re calling it a day, Takamine!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata v2 %}
you see~ we [heard] something painful to the [ears].
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shinobu curious %}
Painful to the ears…?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki frown %}
Yeah, while Kanata and I were walking together, we bumped into Kunugi-sensei.

He told me that none of you three have good grades in class.

You guys devoted yourself so much to Ryuseitai’s activities that you began to neglect your studies, is that right?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki scold %}
Especially you, Nagumo! I heard that you have a red mark[^1] on almost all of your tests! It’s fine to aspire to be Red, but you can’t have that color on your grades, too!

Making others worry will only affect a hero’s reputation! So we’re canceling today’s practice and holding a study session together instead!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora surprised %}
Whaa!? I’ve always been crap at studying, and my grades won’t change whether I study or not! I’m headin’ home if we’re not practicing!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata v2 %}
tetora, i understand your [point], but it is not [manly] to run from your [weaknesses].

how about you [study] with [me] instead…♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora v2 %}
Uu, I’m weak to being told that sorta stuff…

Aight, I got it. The man known as Nagumo Tetora will do his absolute best!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki grin %}
That’s the spirit, Nagumo!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori curious %}
But I don’t feel like we’d get anything out of studying with Morisawa-senpai…? Like, can he even stay quiet while studying…?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata v2 %}
chiaki may not seem like it, but he is actually an [honor student]~♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki grin %}
In fact, before we became five members in Ryuseitai, all I ever really did was study and practice, y’know?

That’s how I got so good at studying! Fuhahahaha! ☆
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori sigh %}
Ehhh…? I’m shocked to hear that a blockhead like him can actually study well…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki grin %}
Fuhaha! If it frustrates you that much, then just work harder on your own studies, Takamine!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori sad2 %}
No, I’m not frustrated or anything… *Sigh…* Fine, I just gotta do it, right…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki v2 %}
Yep! I admire your earnest spirit, Takamine!

Right then, I’d like each of you to open the textbook of your weakest subject!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora serious %}
A-Aight!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shinobu frownshake %}
…………
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki serious %}
What’s wrong, Sengoku? You’re looking away from the textbook…?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shinobu worried %}
Uuu… The very sight of it is terrifying… I am allergic to foreign languages!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki curious %}
Allergic to foreign languages…?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shinobu frownshake %}
Uu, I am a ninja, after all… I cannot handle such high-level English…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata northinking %}
oh yes, that is something a [ninja] would be [weak] at, yes~?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki v2 %}
Worry not, Sengoku! English is just one subject out of many! It’s nothing to be afraid of!

If I remember correctly, you’re good at Japanese history, right?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shinobu serious %}
I-I indeed do have confidence in Japanese history…!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki v2 %}
Then you should know all about how Japan has built up its strength through foreign trade since the olden days.

So if you were to neglect your foreign studies, you may not be able to get back on track with your studies.

Plus, if you learn it properly, making ninjas popular across the whole globe won’t be a far-fetched dream anymore!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shinobu v2 %}
T-That… makes sense…

You’re indeed right, Taichou-dono! I shall show no fear towards English…!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata v2 %}
chiaki is [good] at [accommodating] others, isn’t he~?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori frown %}
If only he could do that a little more with me, too… Not everyone can handle suffocating people…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata v2 %}
by the way, what [subject] are you [good] at, midori?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori northinking %}
Me? Umm, I guess math…

I come from a greengrocer family, so I always have to calculate stuff, even if I don’t want to…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori sigh %}
Man, even my best subject has to do with the greengrocer shop… Do I even have an identity of my own…? <em>Sigh</em>, I’m so depressed…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata smile %}
there is no need to worry, midori. i also did not know anything outside of my own [household].

it is only after chiaki taught me that i was able to learn so much about the [world]~♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora sigh %}
Honestly, I’m jealous enough that you even *have* a good subject, Midori-kun!

I’m awful when it comes to theory stuff… I’m confident in practical subjects like P.E. and home economics, though…

Uuu~! I wish I could memorize all the test answers like the Copying Toast…![^2]
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki grin %}
What’s wrong, Nagumo? You stopped moving your hand!

If you’re struggling on something, I’ll teach you one-to-one!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora surprised %}
Whoa—! Don’t get near me outta nowhere! The room feels so hot now!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki grin %}
Fuhahahaha! If you can’t stand the heat, then study properly! That’s how you can avoid the shame of getting failing grades!

Plus, isn’t it so much manlier to face obstacles fair and square?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora frustrated %}
Guuh~! Aight then! A man’s always got to have guts!
{% endbubble %}

<div class="msr-narration">
    <p>One hour later…</p>
</div>

{% bubble Chiaki grin %}
Alright then, this is our last review. Do you think you can solve question five?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora curious %}
Uu~myu… I think it’s three?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki grin %}
Correct! Mhm, mhm! You’re starting to get it, aren’t you?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora v2 %}
Ossu! It’s not perfect or anythin’, but I feel like I can get through math now!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shinobu blushjoy %}
Heh, I may be able to redeem myself on the next English test thanks to Taichou-dono!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori serious %}
I hate to admit it, but Morisawa-senpai’s *insanely* good at teaching…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata v2 %}
fufu, ever since he taught me [school subjects], he became [proficient] at [tutoring]…♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora northinking %}
Ohhh, so that’s why he seems so used to it. I mean, it must be *super* difficult to teach Shinkai-senpai.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata smile %}
ding…☆
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora surprised2 %}
Oww!? W-Why’d you do that, Shinkai-senpai!?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata scold %}
that is [rude] to say, tetora~ i have a [pride] of my own, too.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora sigh2 %}
I’m sorry for sayin’ that. I always speak without a second thought, and say the wrong thing…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata v2 %}
i forgive you. your [straightforward] nature is a [good part] of you~♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki grin %}
Hahaha! You guys have really outdone yourself! You’re all shining so bright!

I just thought of something, but… How about we have more study sessions from here on out?

Let’s go through more workbooks together, until all of your grades improve! We’ll be able to conquer your weak subjects *and* deepen our bonds among one another. Don’t you think it’s the perfect two-in-one plan…? ☆
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori sigh %}
Ehhh…?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shinobu worried %}
Are you being serious, Taichou-dono…?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora surprised3 %}
Studying every day…? What about practice?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki grin %}
Practice is also important, of course! But so is our duty as students! How about we work hard on our studies first!? That way, we won’t have to worry about any failing grades while performing our idol activities!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora worried %}
Nope, not happening! I’m so done with any sorta suffocating tutoring!

I can just ask my friends in class to help me study, so please spare me!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki surprised0 %}
We can’t? We really can’t!?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori sad3 %}
Yeah, no, I don’t wanna study with Morisawa-senpai every day, either…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shinobu frownshake %}
I’d rather study at home if we are at risk of missing out on practice~
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata awkward %}
chiaki… it is good to be [enthusiastic] about [studying], but a [hero] and an [enthusiastic teacher] are two different types of [people], aren’t they…?

well, i do [understand] wanting them to [study] a bit more, though…
