{% bubble Mitsuru %}
One, two, three! ♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Hajime %}
Ow, owow!! Please do it gently, Mitsuru-kun! My spine will break~!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mitsuru %}
No way it will! You’re more likely to get hurt if you don’t do some stretch exercises, anyway!

C’mon, just bear with it! One, two, three~♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Hajime %}
Owow… You’re too rough… It’s just like how a guy would do it…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mitsuru %}
You’re a guy too, y’know? I’m sorry, I don’t really know how to hold back…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Hajime %}
Ah, it’s alright. I’m just too weak.

But I’m always causing trouble for everyone because of my lack of stamina, so I have to build more muscle.

In fact, I’d like to become more strong and energetic, just like you~♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mitsuru %}
A*hem*. That’s right, you should learn from me some more~♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Madara %}
Heeeey! Mitsuru-saaaan!! Yoohoo, it’s Mamaaaaaa~! ♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mitsuru %}
Ugh— Mike-chan-senpai, you’re gonna practice today…?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Madara %}
Hahaha! You’re being too formal! C’mon, you’re free to call me “Mama”!! ♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mitsuru %}
You’re not my mama…

Wait— Oh? Anzu-neechan!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Hajime %}
Oh, Anzu-san. Hello~♪

You look like you’re ready to do exercise. Are you thinking of exercising for the same reason as mine?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mitsuru %}
Heheh, Hajime-chan’s worried about his low stamina… So he wanted to do some runs with me~♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Hajime %}
Ahaha. Surprisingly, performing as Ra*bits needs a lot of stamina, since we tend to jump around.

I’ve been falling behind thanks to it…

But I can’t continue to let that happen. That’s why Mitsuru-kun is helping me out by training together…♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Madara %}
Well done! A gold star for you! Anzu-san’s the same — she’s been feeling tired lately, so she said she wanted to build more stamina.

Though in her case, it’s just because she’s been overworking.

Since she’s not gonna be decreasing her workload anytime soon, I suggested her to build stamina instead, under my training plan.

You may end up feeling worse with the wrong type of training, so yeah.

I plan to instruct her in every step, like a gym instructor.

If you two are okay with it, we should build muscle together~♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Hajime %}
Waah, it would be a lifesaver. Mitsuru-kun is the genius type of kid, so he doesn’t seem to be the best at teaching.

Honestly, nothing he’s saying makes much sense to me…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mitsuru %}
Hrmph! I don’t get why it’s not coming to you! You just gotta move your body like, *bam!*
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Hajime %}
Sound effects won’t help me understand… I-I’m sorry.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mitsuru %}
Nah, it’s my fault for sucking at explaining things.

…Sooo I *guess* we’d benefit way more if Mike-chan-senpai teaches you instead?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Madara %}
Yes-siree! I haven’t been doing anything club captain-like — I gotta guide my juniors every once in a while~♪

Well, in your case, Mitsuru-san… You have a specific goal to beat your current best record, so a typical, straightforward training wouldn’t hurt you.

But these two just wanna build more stamina, which is a more broad kinda goal.

We gotta figure out a fun way to train, so it can encourage them to keep at it.

And so! Let’s play tag! ♪

I’ll be “it”! I’m gonna chase after you guys once I count up to a hundred, so run away now! Ooone! Twooo! Threee!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mitsuru %}
That was outta nowhere… Uh, huh? We’re gonna be playing tag?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Madara %}
Hahaha! Kids grow stronger through all the outdoor games they play! Well, in the olden days, at least.

Have fun, enjoy yourselves, and grow up big and healthy! I want you all to become great adults!

You’ll grow bored of training if you keep stressing yourself to do it just ’cause you gotta. The most important thing right now is to enjoy yourself.

Let’s have tons of fun today! You’ll wear yourselves out with too much work. It’s good to have a fun day every once in a while~♪

Nooow then! Start running! Run as hard as you can, even if you’re just playing!

Hmmm, if I call myself “mama” instead of “it”, would Anzu-san and Mitsuru-san start calling me that, too~?

No matter! Eiiight! Nine! Ten! Twenty! Thirty!

Hahaha! I may have said I’d count to a hundred, but I never said I’d count one by one!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mitsuru %}
Ah, you cheater\~! You’re always like this! You just do whatever you want\~!

We gotta run, Hajime-chan, Anzu-neechan! Who knows what’ll happen if he catches us~!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Hajime %}
Ah— Wawawa? Please don’t pull me over, Mitsuru-kuuun~!

Ehehe, but this is fun already. It really is nice to train stress-free…♪

Mikejima-senpai knows what’s most important, doesn’t he?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mitsuru %}
Don’t get impressed yet! I won’t believe it until I see proper results from this “training”! He could just be playing with us, y’know?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Madara %}
Ninety! One hundreeed! Alright, alright! It’s festival tiiime! Here I come here I come here I cooome!! Let’s have some fuuuuuun!!!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mitsuru %}
Eeek! W-We gotta run, now! He’s really like an ogre![^1] He’s gonna gobble us up if he catches us~!!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Madara %}
I’m not an ogre, I’m Mamaaa!! C’mooon Baby-chans, Mama’s gonna embrace you gentlyyyyyyy!!!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mitsuru %}
<th><em>(Sticks out tongue)</em></th> Bleegh~! You never show up to our club, so there’s no way you could beat me in running!

You’re not gonna get me! Dash, dash, dash~!!

C’mon, c’mon! Come catch me if you can~! Hahaha! ☆
