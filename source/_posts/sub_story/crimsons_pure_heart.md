{% bubble Tetora %}
Wassup, Midori-kun! Since you’re hanging around in the classroom during lunch break, I’m guessing you’ve got nothing to do? You’re in the Basketball Club, so we should go and play some basketball.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
Basketball…? Nono, I refuse…!

I’d rather stay in this air-conditioned room than suffer outside in the heat… And if I play basketball, I won’t be able to escape being reminded of how suffocating Morisawa-senpai is.

I wanna soothe myself with yuruchara during my break time, at least…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora %}
Uumyu… But you’re so tall; it’d be a waste not to make use of it through playing sports. Also, I’m just hanging around doing nothing ‘cuz I have nobody to exercise with, y’know~

Ah! We could do karate instead! We can do it indoors, and it’ll cool you down!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
No, really, can we just move away from sports first…?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kuro %}
Yo, Tetsu.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora %}
T-Taishou!? Why’re you here?

Could it be… you noticed that I wanted to exercise, and came over to train me!?

Wow, you’re awesome, Taishou! I’m in awe!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kuro %}
That’s not why I’m here. Since you’re here, this must mean it’s classroom 1-A, right?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora %}
Hmm? Yeah it is, but… Wait, I’m not mixing things up, am I, Midori-kun?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
U-Um. You’re not…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kuro %}
Oh, you were talkin’ to Tetsu, I see. I’m here for that first year boy.

Long time no see, Takamine. I got lotsa help from ya Ryuseitai folks back when I was practicin’ my role for the drama shoot.[^1]
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
Ah, yes…

…Wait— D-D-Does that mean you have something to talk about with *me…!?*
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kuro %}
‘Course I do. That’s the reason I came all the way here. Lemme borrow ya for a moment.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora %}
Ohhh!? I never would’ve expected Taishou to ask Midori-kun for anything…!

Are you gonna invite him to the Karate Club? But he’s already in the Basketball Club, y’know~! And I mean, like, look at him — He’s shaking all over!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
Uuu… Am I going to be tied up and thrown into the ocean…? I’d rather die than be tortured alive… I wanna die…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kuro %}
Whaddya take me for…?

Chill, I’m not doin’ anything to ya — I just need to talk to you about somethin’ important.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora %}
You heard him, Midori-kun! You’ll be fine, Taishou’s much kinder than he looks. I’ll even be there to hear him out with you~♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kuro %}
Oh, nah. Sorry Tetsu, but I’d rather you don’t join us.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora %}
Whaaa!? W-Why not…?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kuro %}
It’s a li’l complicated. Takamine, couldja come with me alone to the rooftop?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
O-Okay… Ahh, this might just be where my life ends…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kuro %}
Good, nobody’s around.

Let’s get right to it. I got a lotta things to ask ya — answer ‘em for me, aight?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
U-Um… Did I ever do something to anger you?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kuro %}
…That’s not why we’re here.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
I-I’m so sorry. I’m being a shameless first year, aren’t I? But I really, really can’t think of anything I’ve done to you…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kuro %}
No, really, that’s not what I’m tryna say.

My bad. I look like a punk, so I must’ve given you the wrong idea.

Takamine. I heard you know a lot ‘bout yuruchara. Tell me a thing or two about ‘em.[^2]
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
Huh…?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kuro %}
Y’see, it’s a li’l hard to talk about this in front of Tetsu. He admires my masculinity, so it’ll hit me hard if he thinks I’m an obsessive or even overly affectionate big brother.

…I think you saw her last time, but I have a li’l sis, y’see. She told me that there’s a certain yuruchara that’s been popular around her school lately.

But I dunno a single thing ‘bout what’s trendin’ these days, so she snapped at me, tellin’ me I’m ignorant. She’s right though, I’m such a shameful big bro.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
Kiryu-senpai…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kuro %}
That’s when I remembered Tetsu tellin’ me that you know a lot ‘bout yuruchara.

I know this is sudden, but if it’s alright with ya, couldja tell me a li’l about ‘em? Please, I’m *beggin’* ya here.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
P-Please stop! You don’t have to bow…!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kuro %}
Nah, I gotta, or I won’t feel right ‘bout asking you for this.

…Or what? You think it’s weird that a punk-lookin’ tough guy like me wants to know more about yuruchara?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
N-No. I’m a timid person with a height like this, so people often say that I’m different from what they expected…

Also, yuruchara are loved by everyone, regardless of gender. I refuse to excuse anyone who makes fun of a guy for liking them.

I could teach you anything if it’s going to be about yuruchara. But I always ramble on for days about them, so… Are you sure you want to know…?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kuro %}
Yup, that’s just what I wanted. You’re free to ramble for the rest of our lunch break.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
O-Okay then…

Ummm… Which character is popular in your sister’s school…?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kuro %}
Ahh, I think it looks like this plushie here. You really can’t tell whether it’s meant to be an alien or a veggie, huh…[^3]
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
Wha— You mean Carrotian!? Wait, isn’t this handmade?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kuro %}
Yeah. Made it by watchin’ how plushies are made. I was gonna give it to ya as thanks.

Tell me if it looks too shabby or nothin’ like the character. Sewin’ up a plushie requires a different method from outfits, y’see.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
That’s amazing…!

I already knew that you make unit outfits, but I didn’t expect to see you manage to recreate Carrotian’s cuteness perfectly…!

Heheh, he looks adorable… I’m so happy…♪

Carrotian barely has any merchandise, so finding out that he’s not only popular among kids, but even has his own handmade plushie feels like a dream come true…♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kuro %}
It makes ya that happy to know that this Carrotian dude is popular?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
Yes. He’d been struggling for a long time as a low man— low *yuruchara* on the totem pole.

I’m from a greengrocer, so that’s another reason why I’ve been secretly cheering him on… I’m so, so happy to hear that he’s finally getting popular…♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kuro %}
Haha, low on the totem pole? He sounds like one of us idols~♪

But it sounds like I could get to know him better than I thought. I feel like I get why he’s trendin’ now — and why yuruchara are a thing.

Aight then, how about you start tellin’ me his story from the time he was at the bottom?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
Okay, I’d be glad to…♪

## Translation Notes

[^1]: Referring to <a href="/tough_guy/" target="_blank">Tough Guy</a>.
[^2]: Yuruchara; <em>yuru</em> meaning “loose,” “soft,” “laid-back,” + the word “character”. <em>Yuruchara</em> are a type of mascot characters, with their defining feature being that they have very peculiar designs, ranging from bizarre-cute to adorkable. They’re well-known for being used all across Japan for PR purposes for companies, prefectures, etc… For more information read more <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/yuruchara" target="_blank">here</a>.
