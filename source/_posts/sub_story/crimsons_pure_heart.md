{% bubble Tetora %}
Wassup, Midori-kun! Since you’re hanging around in the classroom during lunch break, I’m guessing you’ve got nothing to do? You’re in the Basketball Club, so we should go and play some basketball.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
Basketball…? Nono, I refuse…!

I’d rather stay in this air-conditioned room than suffer outside in the heat… And if I play basketball, I won’t be able to escape being reminded of how suffocating Morisawa-senpai is.

I wanna soothe myself with mascot characters during my break time, at least…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora %}
Uumyu… But you’re so tall; it’d be a waste not to make use of it through playing sports. Also, I’m just hanging around doing nothing ‘cuz I have nobody to exercise with, y’know~

Ah! We could do karate instead! We can do it indoors, and it’ll cool you down!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
No, really, can we just move away from sports first…?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kuro %}
Yo, Tetsu.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora %}
T-Taishou!? Why’re you here?

Could it be… you noticed that I wanted to exercise, and came over to train me!?

Wow, you’re awesome, Taishou! I’m in awe!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kuro %}
That isn’t why I’m here. Since you’re here, this must mean it’s classroom 1-A, right?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora %}
Hmm? Yeah it is, but… Wait, I’m not mixing things up, am I, Midori-kun?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
U-Um. You’re not…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kuro %}
Oh, you were talkin’ to Tetsu, I see. I’m here for that first year boy.

Long time no see, Takamine. I got lotsa help from ya Ryuseitai folks back when I was practicin’ my role for the drama shoot.[^1]
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
Ah, yes…

…Wait— D-D-Does that mean you have something to talk about with *me…!?*
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kuro %}
‘Course I do. That’s the reason I came all the way here. Lemme borrow ya for a moment.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora %}
Ohhh!? I never would’ve expected Taishou to ask Midori-kun for anything…!

Are you gonna invite him to the Karate Club? But he’s already in the Basketball Club, y’know~! And I mean, like, look at him — He’s shaking all over!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
Uuu… Am I gonna be tied up and thrown into the ocean…? I’d rather die than be tortured alive… I wanna die…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kuro %}
Whaddya take me for…?

Chill, I’m not doin’ anything to ya — I just need to talk to you about somethin’ important.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora %}
You heard him, Midori-kun! You’ll be fine, Taishou’s much kinder than he looks. I’ll even be there to hear him out with you~♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kuro %}
Oh, nah. Sorry Tetsu, but I’d rather you don’t join us.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora %}
Whaaa!? W-Why not…?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kuro %}
It’s a li’l complicated. Takamine, couldja come with me alone to the rooftop?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
O-Okay… Ahh, this might just be where my life ends…
{% endbubble %}

{% img /img/es/idolstory/crimsonspureheart/2.jpg %}

{% bubble Kuro %}
Good, nobody’s around.

Let’s get right to it. I got a lotta things to ask ya — answer ‘em for me, aight?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
U-Um… Did I ever do something to anger you?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kuro %}
…That isn’t why we’re here.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
I-I’m so sorry. I’m being a shameless first year, aren’t I? But I really, really can’t think of anything I’ve done to you…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kuro %}
No, really, that isn’t what I’m tryna say.

My bad. I look like a punk, so I must’ve given you the wrong idea.

Takamine. I heard you know a lot about mascot characters. Tell me a thing or two about ‘em.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
Huh…?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kuro %}
Y’see, it’s a li’l hard to talk about this in front of Tetsu. He admires my masculinity, so it’ll hit me hard if he calls me a siscon or an overly affectionate big brother.

…I think you saw her last time, but I have a li’l sis, y’see. She told me that there’s a certain mascot that’s been popular around her school lately.

But I dunno a single thing ‘bout what’s trendin’ these days, so she snapped at me, tellin’ me I’m ignorant. She’s right though, I’m such a shameful big bro.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
Kiryu-senpai…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kuro %}
That’s when I remembered Tetsu tellin’ me that you know a lot ‘bout mascot characters.

I know this is sudden, but if it’s alright with ya, couldja tell me a li’l about ‘em? Please, I’m *beggin’* ya here.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
P-Please stop! You don’t have to bow…!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kuro %}
Nah, I gotta, or I won’t feel right about asking you for this.

…Or what? You think it’s weird that a punk-lookin’ tough guy like me wants to know more about mascots?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
N-No. I’m pretty timid despite my height, so people often tell me that I’m different from what they expected…

Also, mascots are loved by everyone, regardless of gender. I refuse to let anyone make fun of a guy for liking them.

I could teach you anything if it’s gonna be about mascot characters. But I always ramble on for days about them, so… Are you sure you wanna know…?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kuro %}
Yup, that’s just what I wanted. You’re free to ramble for the rest of our lunch break.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
O-Okay then…

Ummm… What type of mascot is popular in your sister’s school…?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kuro %}
Ahh, I think it looks like this plushie here. You really can’t tell whether it’s meant to be an alien or a veggie, huh…[^2]
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
Wha— You mean Carrotian!? Wait, isn’t this handmade?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kuro %}
Yeah. Made it by watchin’ how plushies are made. I was gonna give it to ya as thanks.

Tell me if it looks too shabby or nothin’ like the mascot. Sewin’ up a plushie requires a different method from outfits, y’see.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
That’s amazing…!

I already knew that you make unit outfits, but I didn’t expect to see you manage to recreate Carrotian’s cuteness perfectly…!

Heheh, he looks adorable… I’m so happy…♪

Carrotian barely has any merchandise, so finding out that he’s not only popular among kids, but even has his own handmade plushie feels like a dream come true…♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kuro %}
It makes ya that happy to know that this Carrotian dude is popular?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
Yes. He’d been struggling for a long time as a low man — low *mascot* on the totem pole.

I’m from a greengrocer, so that’s another reason why I’ve been secretly cheering him on… I’m so, so happy to hear that he’s finally getting popular…♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kuro %}
Haha, low man on the totem pole? He sounds like one of us idols~♪

But it sounds like I could get to know him better than I thought. I feel like I get why he’s trendin’ now — and why mascots are a thing.

Aight then, how about you start tellin’ me his story from the time he was at the bottom?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
Okay, I’d be glad to…♪
