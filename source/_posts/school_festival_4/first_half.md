## Chapter 1

{% bubble Heading %}
The next day — After school
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki %}
Alright, glad to see you’re all here!

It’s time to discuss our thoughts for the school festival! Don’t hold back! Tell me any and all of your opinions…! ☆
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
Oh, you’re allowing opinions…? Then I say we don’t join the festival…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki %}
Well done, Takamine! Glad to hear your opinion first!

But I’ve already handed in the papers to the Student Council! We’re going to do a food truck, no matter what!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora %}
Huh? Not a food stall?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki %}
Yeah, there were way more food stalls than I thought. What do you guys want for the food? C’mon, c’mon~ Let me hear all your thoughts…♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
Whaa… So you’re just gonna ignore *my* thought…

You’re the one who was like, “When it comes to festivals, you think food stalls!”, then decided on everything on your own… and now we’re all gonna be dragged into it… How about you think about how *we* feel…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki %}
My bad! I’ll make sure to do things after I’ve talked to you guys about it, so forgive me this once!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata %}
*Puka, puka*…♪ What is important is the present, not the past. Chiaki has learnt his lesson, so let it flow away with the water~

Chiaki, I would like fish for the truck. Sashimiii…♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki %}
Sashimi, huh… Hmm, raw food is probably a no for food safety reasons. Though I could ask the Student Council about it…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora %}
Taichou, Taichou! If raw food’s out, then we could just grill all of it! Leave the grilling to me!!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki %}
Sorry to ruin your excitement, but absolutely not. We’ll only have a fire on our hands if you start grilling. You should never, ever deal with fire, okay? Promise me that…!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora %}
You’re exaggerating~ Right, guys?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shinobu %}
Weeell… After seeing Taichou-dono like that, it is kind of……

Errmm, Taichou-dono. Our options will go down if we take grilling off the list.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
Um, first off. Can any of you even *cook*?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shinobu %}
I-I have not done it much, but I shall do my best!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata %}
I am very good at preparing fish~♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki %}
I haven’t cooked much, either! But it’s okay! We can do it if we practice! ☆
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
Ahhh, dammit! So you really *didn’t* think this through…!

Morisawa-senpai, let’s at least drop the food truck idea… It’ll only be a disaster like this…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki %}
Don’t give up, Takamine! We just need it to be food we *can* make, right? Right, right! Our options have gone down by a lot!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora %}
Hmm, how about cotton candy? We wouldn’t need to use fire, and we can make it without knowing how to cook, right?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki %}
Oh, cotton candy!? That’s a great idea! Alright, let’s do that! ☆
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora %}
Hehe, it’s a staple to do cotton candy for a stall~ Ah, but we’re doing a food truck instead, so maybe we should’ve gone for something more fancy?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki %}
I’m fine with this. With cotton candy, we could ask for bags with our faces printed on them, and advertise our unit!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
Don’t… I’ll tear every bag apart if you do that…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki %}
Don’t glare at me like that, you’re scaring me!

Alright, so now that we’ve settled on cotton candy… Our customers might starting feeling thirsty after something so sweet, so maybe we could sell juice, too.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shinobu %}
Ahh, I would be glad to have that~ I am in complete agreement. ♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata %}
I am also fine with it~ Make sure to have mineral water in the menu…♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki %}
Alright, then we’ll do cotton candy and juice. Heheh, I’m feeling more excited now that we’ve cleared up the details~♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora %}
Um, Taichou? Do you have a sec?

Taishou asked me about something… If we have time for it, could we also do some patrolling around school?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki %}
You were asked, too? Mikejima-san told me the same thing.

It’s a favor to him, so… If they’re in a fix, I think we should help them out.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora %}
Oh, really? Then I can tell Taishou the good news~!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki %}
If we’re also going to do patrolling, then we’ll need to assign roles. Let’s discuss how we’ll do that next…♪
{% endbubble %}

## Chapter 2

{% img School Festival 4 - Chapter 3.png %}

{% bubble Tetora %}
Ermm, we have five people, so… Are we splitting up into a team with three people, and the other one with two?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki %}
Yeah. Oh, we may as well get people to know our unit while we patrol! Yeah, let’s do that!

If any of you come up with an idea, then tell us all about it…!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
You’re dragging us into something annoying again… Who cares about that… Can’t we just patrol normally…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki %}
You should care! There are all kinds of visitors coming — We can’t let this perfect chance slide!

For example… Hmm, we could wear a happi[^1] with “Ryuseitai” and our names written on it, or carry around signboards… How about it? It’ll attract attention for sure!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
Please don’t say stupid stuff like that… People from my neighborhood are gonna come to the festival — I’ll lose all will to live if they see me like that…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki %}
Ermm… I thought it was a good idea, though…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shinobu %}
Taichou-dono, Taichou-dono! How about doing some sort of skit in the midst of our patrol work?

Something like us saving someone surrounded by delinquents.

I saw a scene like that in the tokusatsu show you told me to watch, so it got stuck in my head.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki %}
Oh, that’s a great idea! You’re a good boy for doing your tokusatsu research!! <th><em>(pat pat pat)</em></th> ♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shinobu %}
Wawa— Please do not pat my head~!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
It’ll make us stand out either way… Nothing’s changed…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora %}
A skit… Then how about we do a hero show after?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki %}
Oohh!! What a bold idea! I like it! Yeah, we should do a hero show! Let me pat you too, Nagumo…☆
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora %}
Ughh, no thanks. And don’t hug me, either.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata %}
But a hero show would require setting up a stage, wouldn’t it?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki %}
Yep. We probably won’t be able to get the usual stage, but we could turn the staircase by the school building into a simple stage.

We’ll advertise our hero show while we patrol. Mhm, this way we can make ourselves known!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
Ughhh… Now it got worse…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki %}
Now, now! We become stronger with every hardship! That’s what being a hero’s all about…! ☆
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
We’re idols, not heroes… Wait no, being an idol is annoying too… Ughhh, everything about this is a big no… I just wanna die…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shinobu %}
You cannot die! Good things will happen to you if you live on. For me, meeting everyone is one of those good things~♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
You’re so bright that I can’t look directly at you…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki %}
We need to decide on the roles for the skit, then. We’ll put aside the hero role for now — Who’ll be the delinquent, and who’ll be the victim?

The delinquent role is the bad guy here, so I’ll do it if no one wants it.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora %}
Umm… Could I do it?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki %}
What’s wrong, Nagumo!? Aren’t you always saying how you want to be a man among men!?

Why would you want to be a delinquent…!?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora %}
No no, there’s no real reason to it, it’s just… I thought it’d be kinda fun.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki %}
O-oh… Well, I’m glad to know you’re interested…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora %}
And anyway, it’s not like I suddenly lost sight of my whole “man among men” dream~
{% endbubble %}

## Chapter 3

{% img School Festival 4 - Chapter 4.png %}

{% bubble Chiaki %}
Alright. I thought we'd have the most trouble with this, but we've quickly settled the delinquent role, so what's left are the heroes and the victim!

We'll decide the heroes last. Who'll be the victim? Anyone here wants to do it?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shinobu %}
Standing out is a bit too embarrassing for me, so…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
Same…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata %}
Hmm… So no one wants to do it… How about I take it?

Yaaay! Delinquent-san is here~♪ Would you like to eat fish?

Irritation comes from calcium deficiency, you see. You should eat lots of fish~♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shinobu %}
T-There is no sense of danger… I cannot comprehend why you are recommending him fish.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
Then how about if Morisawa-senpai does it…? Though that has its own problems…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shinobu %}
Hmm, he would simply try to deal with the danger by himself… We need someone similar to a frail girl, or something…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
Girl…? So like, the transfer student…?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shinobu %}
Yes, I suppose so. Though I do not know if she is “frail”…

Wh— Ow ow ow!?

Huh!? Transfer student-dono? W-When did you come behind me…? Please stop poking my head like that~!

A-Are you angry at me? I give, I give! Please forgive me~!

*Sniff*… I suffered such misfortune…

Though… Transfer student-dono, do you have something to do here?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki %}
Oh, so you were walking by the AV room when you heard a lot of noise, and came in to check what was going on? Mhm, I see! You came at the perfect moment!

You see, we’re planning this and that for the school festival, and have also decided to do a hero show.

We were just discussing how we’d like you to do the victim role for us.

Akehoshi has told me about it, so I’m already aware that you’re busy preparing Trickstar’s programme for the festival, but… If you could just help us a tinsy bit, then…

Hm? “Yes, I’d like to help if you need it”? Thank you, transfer student!

We’ve got ourselves someone for the victim role! It’s time for the role everyone’s been waiting for — The heroes! Heheh, I’m excited to see who’ll get to be this one~♪
{% endbubble %}


{% bubble Heading %}
A few days later — After school
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora %}
Midori-kuuun! Over here, c’mon~!

Shinkai-senpai said it’s okay to practice near the fountain, so we’re goin’ all out today~!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
Uhh, the fountain isn’t his domain or anything, so I don't think his approval even matters…?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora %}
I know, but… He’s always bathing in it, so I thought I should get his permission, first.

Why *does* he do that, anyway? The first time I saw him doing it, I thought he was someone suspicious. I was this close to reporting him to someone.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
Ughh… Don’t ask me… Why not ask him instead…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora %}
I did, but it got me nowhere… He really is a mysterious one, huh?

Well, whatever, it’s time we start practicing. Transfer student-san isn’t here yet, so you do both the victim and hero role for now!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
Don’t just ask me for the impossible… Also, you called her over too…?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora %}
Ossu, I did! I asked her if she wanted to join us when I saw her on my way here, and she said yes!

So we may end up doing it together if she finishes her work in time!

Hehe! I’m so grateful that you’re also joining practice, Midori-kun~♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
I didn't have anything to do at home… And being bored means I’ll end up thinking about pointless things, which would only make me depressed… so I thought I should do something to help me relax, that’s all…

Ughhh… Why do *I* gotta do the hero role…

I’m sooooo depressed… I wanna dieeeeeeee…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora %}
You’re getting depressed either way…

You won in rock paper scissors, that’s why. Can’t do anything about that.

Taichou totally looked like he wanted to do it, but he still said, “I lost, so of course I’d give the role to you!”

He didn’t back down from his words, even when you told him you didn’t want it… Kept saying it’s the winner’s right to have the role… It’s kinda surprising that he’d be stubborn about these things.

Hm, since you and Shinkai-senpai got the role… Maybe I should’ve asked him to join practice, too.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
How about we don’t practice at all…? You’re really into this for some reason, but… It’s kiiinda weird…

I mean, have you ever been this serious about this sort of stuff before…?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora %}
Um— Well! My role’s the delinquent, yeah? So I’m not used to it! I gotta pump myself up~!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
Hmm… Eh, whatever… Maybe you can work hard for both of us, since I’ve got zero motivation for this…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora %}
Ah— Transfer student-san! Midori-kun, she’s here!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
Transfer student-san…♪ I’m so glad you’re here… Nagumo-kun pushed on me two roles at once, so I was this close to running away…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora %}
'Kay then! It’s time to get ourselves pumped~!
{% endbubble %}

## Chapter 4

{% bubble Tetora %}
Yo, yo. Lady, why don’t ya come over with me a lil’?

Huh? “Where are we going”? Uhh… To the school store, I guess?

Oh, you will? Alright then, let’s go~! ♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
Umm… There’s no opportunity for the hero to show up…

Hm, actually, that’s just perfect…♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora %}
And they all lived happily ever after~♪

…Wait! No, no! What’s the point of a hero show when there’s no hero!?

You too, transfer student-san! You gotta start doing the scene where you shake me off, y’know!?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
Whaa… *You're* the one who went along with what she said…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora %}
I-I just, y’know, accidentally got pulled in… Look, it doesn’t matter! We’re starting over again!

Yo, yo. Lady, why don’t ya come over with me a lil’?

Whaaa—!?? W-Why’re you grabbing my hand!? Please stop! I dunno how to deal with physical contact with girls~!

Huh? Ahh, this is supposed to be a forceful scene where I grab your arm, but since I didn’t do that, you did it yourself…?

Uuu… I’m so pathetic. I know I gotta be shameless for this, but I can’t do it! I’m too embarrassed~!

Maybe I gotta forget the part where you’re a girl… But, but… you *are* one, so…

Ughh… Nothing’s making sense to me anymore. Which only means one thing— Midori-kun, you gotta show me how it’s done!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
Uh, I dunno what the heck you mean by that…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora %}
Well, y’see~ You’ve got a pretty intimidating aura even when you’re just standing still with a blank look.

So you should try saying the delinquent line, too! You’ll totally be just like one!

Ahh, but you’re super handsome, so… I think a girl would gladly follow you instead…?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
I’m not made for this, though… I’m too timid… And you’re not timid yourself, but you don’t really feel delinquent-ish, Nagumo-kun…

It’s just an act, anyway… I don’t think we need to be that serious about it…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora %}
No way, I can’t just do this casually! I won’t become a man among men like that!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
Umm… Was this part of your “man among men” training or something…?

Huh—?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora %}
Midori-kun? What’s wrong, why’re you trembling…?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
Umm, there’s someone scary coming over here… S-Sorry, Nagumo-kun, but I just remembered I have something to do… Bye!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora %}
Huh!? Midori-kun!? Um, he just dashed away…?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kuro %}
Yo, Tetsu. Nice seein’ you here too, li’l miss.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora %}
Ah! Taishou\~! You came at the right moment! There’s something I wanna ask you\~!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kuro %}
Oh? That came out of nowhere… But sure, why not. I wanna pay back the favor, so ask me anything.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora %}
Huh!? Pay me back!? I don’t remember doing anything for you, though…?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kuro %}
You took the patrolling job, didn’t ya? Hasumi’s also really grateful.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora %}
No, no, there’s no need for that…! Taichou got the same request from Mikejima-senpai — that’s why it was accepted so easily!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kuro %}
Doesn’t matter, we’re still really thankful. Thanks, Tetsu.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora %}
T-Taishou… I’m so happy! Just hearing you say that gets me pumped up to work harder at my delinquent role~!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kuro %}
Delinquent role…? Oh yeah, what *were* you two doing together?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora %}
Oh y’see, we’re gonna do a skit in the middle of our patrolling. I was practicing for it just now!

Um, Taishou! What do I gotta do to become a cool delinquent!?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kuro %}
A cool delinquent…? I don’t get it, but… I really can’t advise you on anything about acting.

My bad… I said you could ask me anything, but I still failed to help you out.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora %}
There’s never a time you’ve done that! And anyway, I should be learning the ways of a cool delinquent, not asking, right?

I’ll work really hard, and learn as much as I can to become a cool delinquent! So, Taishou! Please look forward to seeing it…! ☆
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kuro %}
O-Okay…?

What’s up, li’l miss? They’ve decided on my role for the Cinderella play?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora %}
Are you serious!? Who’re you gonna be…!?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kuro %}
The Second Prince…? Was there even someone like that in Cinderella…?

Oh, right, you did mention there’d be added roles… You must’ve been talking about this one.

But me, as a prince…? You’re not messin’ around with me, right?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora %}
Taishou as a prince, huh~ You’re super cool, so you’ll be able to perfect the prince role~!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kuro %}
I told you already, I’ve never acted before… Oh well, what’s done is done. I’ll do the role.

Tetsu, li’l miss. I’ve got practice to do with the Drama Club members, so I’ll be off.

We’ve both gotten roles we’re not used to, but let’s work as best as we can, yeah?
{% endbubble %}

## Chapter 5

{% bubble Heading %}
Day of the school festival
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shinobu %}
Ah— Taichou-dono! Good morning~♪

Ehehe, I thought I was the first one to arrive, but you always come much earlier!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki %}
Yep! This is the school festival we’ve all been waiting for, so I woke up as early as I could!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora %}
Oh? You two here are here already, huh? Oh well, good morning! ☆
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki %}
Good morning! …Hm? Nagumo, you came over with Takamine, huh?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora %}
Ahh, I met him on the way here, so we came together.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata %}
Good mooorning~…♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki %}
K-Kanata!? You always arrive on the last minute, and sometimes you’re completely late — Yet you came really early today, huh!?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata %}
Huh? Was I? Hmm~ I thought I would not make it on time, so I hurried over here…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki %}
That’s not a problem at all! Anyhow, we’re all here now, so let’s head over to the food truck.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora %}
Woohoo\~! Can’t wait\~♪ This is my first time getting in one, so I’m really excited!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki %}
Now then, the truck’s this way. Everyone, follow me…☆
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki %}
You guys are looking great!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora %}
No no, wait… You suddenly told us to wear this so we did, but… when did you even get these?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki %}
We’re going to help patrol around the school festival, right? So we got these outfits as reward. And we even have outfits for our truck!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora %}
Oooh. So you didn’t ask Taishou for the outfits this time, right?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki %}
Yeah, he’s busy with a bunch of stuff, after all. I couldn’t bear to ask him.

Same with the transfer student… I was really unsure of what to do at first, so this really saved us!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata %}
<em><th>(Sniff, sniff)</th></em>… i smell fish\~♪ excuse me while i go buy some\~♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki %}
Wait, wait! Don’t go off on your own until breaktime, please!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
…………
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora %}
Midori-kuuun? You’ve been quiet this whole time. It’s pretty scary when you’re quiet and not doing your usual “I’m so depressed, I wanna die” thing, y’know?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
Ah no, I’ve been trying to figure out a way to get away from all this…

Ahh dammit, I wish this school festival didn’t even *exist*…!!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shinobu %}
Midori-kun, Midori-kun! We are getting customers soon enough, so you cannot show that kind of face, okay~?

Everyone would just run away!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki %}
Yeah, looks like we got a few customers while we were busy changing. Sengoku, Nagumo and I will patrol around the area, so I’ll leave the food truck tending to Kanata and Takamine.

Right, and we’re off! We’ll protect Yumenosaki Academy’s peace…♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
……

<th>(Ughhh, they all left… And now I’m all alone with Shinkai-senpai…)</th>

<th>(Mmmm… I don’t get anything he does…)</th>

<th>(He’s been humming some “splish-splash yip-yay~♪” song, so I seriously don’t have a single clue about what he’s thinking…)</th>

<th>(I’m already not that great at communication, and now you’re telling me to tend a stall with a weird senior? That’s just too much for me…)</th>

Huh? Ahh, are you a customer…? Um, welcome…

Shinkai-senpai, I’ll make the cotton candy, so… You should prepare the orange juice…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata %}
Here you go~ Nice, cold water~♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
You’re confusing the customer… Let’s change spots, Shinkai-senpai…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata %}
Hehehe, white cotton candy is pretty, isn’t it\~? But I like blue the most. It is the color of the ocean, you see\~♪

Here you go\~ A bright blue cotton candy, just like the ocean\~♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
Shinkai-senpai, quit ignoring the orders…

Huh? This cotton candy is prettier…? Uh… Well, if you say so… Umm, thank you very much…

<th>(W-we managed to do it somehow… But are we really going to be okay like this…?)</th>

*Sigh*… I wanna go home…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata %}
Midori~ I see you are sighing. Please take a look at this child, and cheer up.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
Huh? What’s this?

It looks so cute and strangely mascot character-like…♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata %}
It is a plush toy of a scotoplanes~ I could give it to you if you like it.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
A-Are you sure…? It’s so cute — Isn’t it precious to you?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata %}
Ehehe. You say that, but you are hugging it tightly, you know~…♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
There’s no way I *wouldn’t* hug this…☆ Ahh, it’s so soothing…♪

Thank you, Shinkai-senpai. You really are kind—!?

<th>(H-He’s gone! Whaa— Where did he go…? What do I do, what do I do…! A customer’s here…!!)</th>

W-Welcome… Cotton candy and melon juice, right…?

And that customer wants cotton candy and grape juice… Huh? Apple juice, too…?

<th>(I-I can’t…! There’s no way I can do this on my own…!)</th>

<th>(S-Shinkai-senpai, come back…! Ahhh jeez, it doesn’t even have to be him—Someone just come here~!)</th>
{% endbubble %}

## Chapter 6

{% bubble Shinobu %}
Garden Terrace, all clear. I shall proceed onwards to the next area!

<th>(Ehehe, we received walkie-talkies from the student council — it makes everything feel so much more professional~♪)</th>

<th>(It is much better for me to patrol alone rather than with everyone else, as I excel at collecting intelligence. I am glad I suggested the idea to Taichou-dono!)</th>

<th>(Heheh~ This is how I will show my true abilities~♪)</th>

…Hmm?

<th>(Ah! That looks like transfer student-dono! Alright! Time to say hello~♪)</th>
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kaoru %}
Yoohoo yoohoo, transfer student-chan! What’s up~? Why’re you here?

I’m currently trying to pull in customers to our cafe, see.

Hm? Then I should go to a place where people are around, instead of being here?

Well y’see~ That area’s been left for doggie, so~

I purposely stepped away from that area, and now I got to meet you… I’m so lucky~♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shinobu %}
<th>(Hmmm, someone did it before I could. That person is acting strangely friendly with her…)</th>

<th>(It feels as if transfer student-dono is not sure what to do with him, either. Should I go in there and help her?)</th>
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kaoru %}
Hey, hey, transfer student-chan. You remember our promise, right?

Mhm mhm, I’m glad to hear that~ I’ll make sure to escort you to the cafe, so look forward to it, ‘kay? ♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shinobu %}
<th>(Ahh—! She is not one to show any emotion, and yet she is making a perplexed face right now…!)</th>

<th>(I-I must save her! But but, I feel anxious doing it alone~! I-I shall contact the others for the time being!)</th>
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata %}
Ding…♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kaoru %}
Ow—!? That was such a soft way to say it, but you genuinely went and chopped me hard, Kanata-kun…!!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata %}
Ehehe, naughty children must be punished~ You should not trouble transfer student-san, okay?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kaoru %}
“Naughty children”? I’m your age, y’know~? And I’m not doing that, anyway.

We were just having a nice chat. Right, transfer student-chan?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata %}
Hmm. She is clearly saying otherwise, though?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kaoru %}
Whaa~? Sorry, sorry. I wasn’t trying to do that, really.

Ah, and now you’re hiding behind Kanata-kun…

I won’t pester you anymore, so come on over to my side~ Come on~♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata %}
Ahaha… She is shaking her head and completely refusing. It seems you are hated.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kaoru %}
Wha— No, I’m not! Why’d you go and say something I’ve been worrying about, huh!?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata %}
You were worried about that? I am sorry, I did not notice.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kaoru %}
It’s fine, I guess. Anyway, why’re you here? Didn’t you say you guys were doing a food truck?

Ahh, but you also said something about patrolling, right? What a load of work that must be~ If it were me, I’d have skipped it to go and flirt with girls.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata %}
You really love girls, don’t you, Kaoru. But that still does not mean you should flirt with girls that clearly do not like it.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kaoru %}
Alright, alright. All I gotta do is *not* bother transfer student-chan anymore, right?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata %}
Ehehe, let me praise you. Good boy, good boy…♪

Kaoru, I think I need to leave for now.

I left my spot to rehydrate, but that also means I left Midori alone to tend the truck.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kaoru %}
Guess I’ll leave too, then~ I’ve also left most of the work to Sakuma-san, so~. We may be having our cafe indoors, but it’s noon right now, so it must be rough on him.

Transfer student-chan, see you later~ I await your return, my princess~♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata %}
Now then, it is time I head back to Midori.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shinobu %}
U-Uuuu~ Transfer student-dono~…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata %}
Huh? Shinobu? Since when were you here~?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shinobu %}
I was here this whole time…

I noticed transfer student-dono was feeling awkward around that person, but I was too anxious to do anything…

It went alright thanks to you, Shinkai-dono, but… I deeply apologize for failing to save you, transfer student-dono!

Y-You will forgive me? Ehehe, you are truly kind~♪

Shinkai-dono, I shall return with you. It is probably time for us to switch places, anyway.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata %}
It is that time already~? Transfer student-san, we will be off now.

Please do enjoy the school festival. *Puka, puka*…♪
{% endbubble %}

## Chapter 7

{% bubble Chiaki %}
The running grounds is also clear!

Heheh, walkie-talkies are so convenient~♪ This is fun, it’s kinda like we’re in an undercover investigation…☆
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora %}
Yo, yo. Lady, why don’t ya come over with me a lil’?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki %}
Mm—!? W-What’s wrong, Nagumo? I’m not a lady, and your face is kinda scaring me…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora %}
*Huuuh*? Quit your yappin’ and come with me already. Just drop everythin’ you’re doin’ and flirt with me, alright?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki %}
F-F-F-Flirt!? Nagumo, what happened with you!? Did you accidentally eat something weird!?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora %}
Uh, no, I didn’t. I’m just rehearsing for my role.

Honestly, I don’t really feel like I’m grasping it yet… Just what *is* a cool delinquent…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki %}
Ah, that’s what it was… I'm happy to see you working this hard for your role, but I prefer the usual you.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora %}
Oh, I know! Taichou, you’ve known Taishou for a long time, right? Could you tell me what he was like back then? Please!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki %}
B-Back then…? Why would you want to know that all of a sudden?

Mmm… I think it’s better if you ask him, not me.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora %}
He’ll just avoid the question if I did~

Well, whatever. I’m sure Taishou as a delinquent was as super duper cool as he is right now!
{% endbubble %}

{% img <th>(Delinquent and Hero)</th> Tetora Nagumo CG.png %}

{% bubble Tetora %}
‘Kay, I glare like this, and… Hey, hey! What d’you think you’re lookin’ at!? This ain’t here for show~!

Guuuh\~!! That was just like a delinquent! Studying all those mangas with delinquents really came in handy\~♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki %}
…………
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tomoya %}
UAAAHHHH—!?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora %}
A-A scream…!? Taichou, I think there’s trouble afoot!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki %}
Yeah, I think I heard it from that side! We have to hurry, quick!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tomoya %}
S-Stop! Don’t come any closer, pervert~!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Wataru %}
I’m not a pervert, I’m your stepmother.

*Fufufu!* It may have arrived late, but Cinderella had her own rebellious stage, after all~ How wonderful! Tonight we’ll be having red bean rice to celebrate…☆
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tomoya %}
I told you not to come any closer—!! It’s grooooooss~!!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Wataru %}
It’s human nature to chase after anything that runs away! Ahahahahaha!! ☆
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tomoya %}
You’re making no sense! That’s only you, isn’t it!?

…Hm? Tetora?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora %}
Oh, what… It’s just you, Tomoya-kun.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tomoya %}
W-Why are you so disappointed!? Oh c’mon~ That’s kinda rude, don’t you think?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora %}
Ah, yeah… Sorry.

Huh? You’re in a girl’s outfit?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tomoya %}
Yeah, we have our club’s play soon. What about you? What’re you doing here?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora %}
We’re patrolling around the area. We heard a scream and rushed over, but it’s just the usual thing with you, so there doesn’t seem to be any problems.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tomoya %}
No, no! There’s plenty of problems here, y’know!?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki %}
It’s almost time for the Drama Club’s play, huh… Ah, Kiryu was going to be in it too, wasn’t he? Nagumo, I’m sure you want to go see him, so you’re free to do so.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora %}
I badly wanna, but Taishou told me to prioritize my work, so~ I’m gonna hold it in!

Guuh~! I would’ve loved to see his awesome figure at least once, though!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tomoya %}
Oh, then I could ask him for a picture while we’re in the dressing room.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora %}
Really!? You’re such a nice guy, Tomoya-kun~♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tomoya %}
Don’t sweat it, we’re friends.

…Alright, it’s about time I go. See ya, Tetora. Good luck on your side~♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora %}
Back at ya! I can’t watch the play, but I’m cheering for you!
{% endbubble %}

## Chapter 8

{% bubble Tetora %}
Heeey, Midori-kun! Shinkai-senpai!

Woah— What’s with this queue!? It’s only this area that’s crowded — What’s going on!?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki %}
I’m not sure, but it’s going to be hard for only the two of them to deal with this many customers. We have to go and help them!

Excuse me! Please, let us pass through!

Thank you very much…☆ Are you alright, Takamine? You look exhausted. Go and take a rest on that chair!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
M-Morisawa-senpai…? And Nagumo-kun came back, too…

Y-You saved me… I almost lost all hope in this world and was ready to die…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora %}
I’m glad we made it in time, then! But I don’t see Shinkai-senpai anywhere… Where’d he go?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
That’s what *I* wanna know… He disappeared before I knew it, so I’ve been tending the truck all by myself… I feel like I’m dying inside…

I worked this hard, so there’s no problem with me heading straight to my death, right…? ♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora %}
You can’t give up now! If you’re a man, then you gotta show all your guts and pump yourself back up!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata %}
I am back~♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki %}
Kanata! Just where were you?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata %}
Hm\~ I was rehydrating myself. I am now in full energy\~♪

…Oh? Midori, you look exhausted. It is all because I left you alone with the truck… I am very sorry.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki %}
Oh jeez, I *told* you to avoid going off on your own…

Well, you seem to have learnt your lesson now, so I won’t say anything else. Just be careful next time!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shinobu %}
Taichou-dono! Shinkai-dono has fulfilled his heroic task wonderfully!

Transfer student-dono and I saw it ourselves! Ahh, but she had something to do, so she is not here right now.

He magnificently dropped a chop on someone who was trying to play around with her~ Heh! ♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki %}
That so!? I see, he’s also growing to become a member of Ryuseitai, one step at a time! Hahaha!! ☆

Right! Now that Kanata and Sengoku are here, everybody listen up while we're serving our customers!

Nagumo, Sengoku, and I will tend the truck, so Kanata and Takamine should head out and patrol.

And so! You two go now! Leave this place to us!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata %}
Midori~ Will you be okay? I will work hard in patrol work to make up for the time I left you alone.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
Um, no… Who knows what’ll happen if I leave that to you…

Let’s go change for now… Not that I really wanna, since it’d just make me stand out…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki %}
Ah, wait! Do you know everything that you’re supposed to do from here on?

We won’t have enough time to discuss anything about our hero show, so this is the perfect chance to ask me anything you’re not sure of.

Good luck on your skit, you three! Sengoku and I will be watching over you together!

That’s all from me. Right then, it’s time to fulfill our duties…☆
{% endbubble %}

## Chapter 9

{% bubble Midori %}
<th>(*Sigh*… I’m finally done with tending the truck, but now I’ve gotta deal with all this hero show and skit stuff… Ughhh, this is soooo depressiiiing…)</th>

…Hm?

<th>(W-What!? Shinkai-senpai’s gone again…!)</th>

<th>(Whaaa… Morisawa-senpai *just* told him off, why’s he still doing this…!?)</th>

<th>(H-He shouldn’t be that far… hopefully!)</th>

<th>(Ahh man, why do I have to deal with all of this…!)</th>
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki %}
Welcome! What would you like?

Okay, one cotton candy! Please wait one moment…☆
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shinobu %}
Taichou-dono is handling this wonderfully… Does he have experience in serving customers?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora %}
Who knows~ Oh, did you prepare the juices for our customer, by the way?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shinobu %}
Ah— Yes. Melon juice and grapefruit juice, correct?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora %}
Yup! Here you go, enjoy your drinks~♪

Ah! Welcome! Two cotton candy, pineapple juice and orange juice for you, right?

We have a new order. Sengoku-kun, please prepare the cotton candy!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shinobu %}
Understood! Heheh, I can prepare the food, while you handle serving the customers. I am truly thankful that you are being considerate towards me, since I am shy with strangers.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora %}
It wasn’t intentional, though… I’m bad at handling stuff, so~ I’m sure I’d just disappoint the customers with badly-made cotton candy.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shinobu %}
No, no! It is my first time making cotton candy as well! How about you try making one yourself, Tetora-kun?

You may just make one even better than I do!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora %}
…You’re right. I shouldn’t give up before I even try! That’s not manly!

Nagumo Tetora will take on this challenge!

Uhhh, so I rotate the stick…?

Ahh—! Some got on my hand! Ack— It’s all sticky now~!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shinobu %}
Tetora-kun, you have enough cotton candy near the bottom, so you should add more on the top!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora %}
T-The top? L-Like this…?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shinobu %}
Well done! I had only realized this after I messed up once, but you can wrap the cotton candy around the top side of the stick if you aim it downwards.

When there is too much cotton candy on the bottom, you aim the stick downwards, and then vice versa. Making cotton candy is essentially repeating these two steps.

You just have to repeat this until there is no more cotton candy, and it will finally be complete! Mhm! This is a pretty cotton candy~♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora %}
R-Really…? I guess even I can make something~ Hehe! ♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki %}
You guys look like you’re having fun! Mhm mhm, it’s beautiful to see you two getting along so wonderfully…☆
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shinobu %}
Taichou-dono! Look, look! It is the very first cotton candy Tetora-kun made~♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki %}
Ooh, it’s perfect! Great job, Nagumo!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shinobu %}
Oh—! The customers are starting to wonder what is taking us so long. I shall prepare the juice at once!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki %}
Hehe, an adorable customer is here. Where are your mommy and daddy?

Ohh, the lady waving her hand is your mommy, and the one beside her is your daddy? I see, I see! You told them to wait there, since you can make an order all by yourself?

So this is your very first time doing an errand! That’s wonderful! I’m so impressed!

Okay, so cotton candy and apple juice is enough? Right then, give me a moment.

Hmhmhm~♪
{% endbubble %}

{% img <th>(Exciting School Festival)</th> Chiaki Morisawa CG.png %}

{% bubble Chiaki %}
I’ll give you the cotton candy first. It’s sweet and tasty? Oh! You have a bit on your cheek. Be careful while you eat it, okay?

Mhm, mhm~ You’re a good kid…♪ Can you hold the apple juice? Mhm, carry it carefully so it doesn’t spill. Bye byee~ Let’s meet again! ☆
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora %}
Kids really like you, don’t they? They’re always swarming around you during a hero show.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki %}
Yeah, I love kids! I was this close to hugging the kid just now, but I held it in!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora %}
Uh, yeah, it’s a good thing you did.

Right, Taichou. It’s about time for the skit, so can I leave the rest to you two?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki %}
Yeah, there’s not as many customers now, so we’ll be fine.

Nagumo, I know you didn’t ask for my help, but… Just because you’re acting out a delinquent role, doesn’t mean you have to try and become one.

Just be yourself. That would make me feel more at ease.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora %}
…?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki %}
Ahaha, you don’t seem like you understand what I’m trying to say. Well, for now, just do it the way you want to.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora %}
Gotcha! Right then, Taichou, Sengoku-kun! I’ll see you later!
{% endbubble %}

## Chapter 10

{% bubble Kanata %}
Excuse meee~ I would like some fish, please~♪

Huh? You do not have fish?

Then I would like something that is like fish…♪

Ohh, there is a food stall selling taiyaki over there, I see~ Tai are tasty, so I like it.

Thank you for the information~
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Sora %}
Uuuu~…?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata %}
Oh no, I bumped into you… I am sorry, are you okay?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Sora %}
Sora’s fine! Sora was just not paying attention!

Huh? Sea Onii~san?

HaHa\~♪ Hello! Sora greets his seniors when he meets them\~♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata %}
hello~♪ did you not come with nacchan today?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Sora %}
Sora was with Shisho only a second ago, but then he got separated from him~

It was wrong of Sora to not pay attention!

Sora was feeling ill from the crowd, so when he tried to go somewhere without as much color, he got lost.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata %}
I see~ There is no need to worry, yellow kid. I will take you to where Nacchan is at~

It is part of my patrolling job to protect lost children, and find their parents.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Sora %}
HiHi\~♪ Thank you! Sora shows his gratitude to anyone who is kind to him\~♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata %}
…………
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Sora %}
Wawa—? Sora hears a growling sound~ This is… the color of an empty stomach!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata %}
Oh, you figured me out~…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Sora %}
HuHu\~? Sea Onii\~san, are you hungry? Sora learnt from Senpai that people can’t fight when they’re hungry!

What would you like? Sora will buy it for you if you tell him~
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata %}
Ehehe, thank you. You are kind, just like Nacchan~

Do not worry, I was thinking of buying taiyaki just now~ Excuse meee, I would like two taiyaki~♪

Huh? There is red bean paste flavor and cream flavor? Hm~ I think I will take one red bean paste.

Which one do you think is good for the other taiyaki?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Sora %}
HeHe~? Sora is the one who has to decide?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata %}
Yes~ I am going to give you one as a present, so please choose a flavor~♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Sora %}
HoHo~♪ Thank you! Sora shows his gratitude to anyone who treats him nicely! Okay, Sora will take the cream one!

Let’s have half of each! Getting to taste both flavors will make Sora so happy~♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata %}
Hehe, that is a great idea~♪

Ow, hot— It is fresh from the oven, so I have to cool it down before eating it, don’t I… I will burn otherwise.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Sora %}
Are you bad with hot food, Sea Onii~san?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata %}
Yes, I am~ It is a shame I cannot eat immediately, even though I am starving.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Sora %}
Ah— Sea Onii~san! There’s a colorful and pretty dolphin!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata %}
Uwaa, it is candy in the shape of a dolphin\~ This will not be hot, so I can eat it straight away\~♪

Excuse meee~  I would like two of this dolphin candy~♪

Here you go, yellow kid. It would not be right if I eat one by myself.

It will make us both much happier to share delicious food and fun things with each other~♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Sora %}
Sora agrees! Sora got separated from Shisho and Senpai, but Sora is happy to have met with Sea Onii~san~♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata %}
<th><em>(Lick, lick)</em></th>…♪ Mm~ It gave me a tingly feeling.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Sora %}
Really? Sora’s tastes sour~ Maybe it’s lemon flavor?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata %}
Hmm… The yellow area must be lemon flavor, huh~ The blue area is probably soda flavor?

Ehehe, we get to enjoy all kinds of flavors, then~ I am glad we bought this.

The taiyaki should have cooled down by now, too. This fish is enough for me.

I am much more happy like this~♪
{% endbubble %}

## Chapter 11

{% bubble Tetora %}
Excuse me, I need to get through! Please move aside!

<th>(Ugh, it’s so crowded…)</th>

<th>(I’ll just get pushed back if I force myself through the crowd, but some people won’t move aside even when I ask them to… This is tough…)</th>

<th>(Oh yeah, the Drama Club’s performance must have ended by now.)</th>

<th>(I heard some people talking about how cool the Second Prince was. Just what I’d expect from Taishou! I bet he performed his prince role superbly…!)</th>

<th>(I gotta work hard too! I gotta perform my delinquent role perfectly, so he’ll praise me for a great job!)</th>

<th>(Ah, well, it’s not that I took this role to be praised…)</th>

<th>(It’s just— I wanna go down the same path Taishou took, I guess. I feel like I could get one step closer to being a man among men if I do this…!)</th>

Are you eating while patrolling…? You’re way too free, Shinkai-senpai~

HaHa~♪ Hello! Sora greets anyone he knows! ♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora %}
Oh, Harukawa-kun! ‘Sup~☆

Uhh… Kinda weird to see you two together. What happened?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Sora %}
You see~ Sora got separated from Shisho and Senpai. He was lost, so Sea Onii\~san has been taking care of him\~
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora %}
Ohh, I see! Great work, Shinkai-senpai…☆
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata %}
You too, Tetora. Are you hungry? You can have some taiyaki if you like~♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora %}
Huh— Is that okay with you?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata %}
Of course it is~ We will all become even more happy if we share tasty food with you.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora %}
T-Then I’ll have some! <th><em>(munch, much)</em></th>…♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata %}
ufufu. you look very happy~

the bigger the happiness circle becomes, the closer we get to the whole world being filled with happiness.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora %}
Ahaha, that’s just how a hero would think! Please show that same kind of heroic feel in the skit we’re having later!
{% endbubble %}

…? Later? Are we doing something?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora %}
Umm, you’re joking, right?

We’re planning to do a skit where I’m a delinquent who chats up with the transfer student, and then you and Midori-kun will come over and save her, remember?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata %}
Ahh~… That’s right. Midori and I are the heroes, yes?

That kind of feels strange. When I think of “hero”, I think of Chiaki.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora %}
I can’t deny that. Also, I’ve been wondering for a while now, but… Where’s Midori-kun?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kaoru %}
Hey— Move, move! Ah— Kanata-kun! Perfect timing!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata %}
Kaoru~? Why do you look so flustered?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kaoru %}
Well, see… There’s some delinquent guys who managed to get into our school somehow…

They came over to our cafe, too. They were bothering the girls, so we asked them to leave.

But I heard something similar happened someplace else, too…

I’ve been trying to find someone from the student council so I could report the issue. You’re patrolling, right? Can you contact any of the members?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata %}
Why yes, I can~ With this walkie-talkie, I can—

Hm? Ah, that’s right, I left that with Midori, didn’t I…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora %}
I also had mine with me, but I left it behind when I was done with my patrol work~!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kaoru %}
Are you serious… so I really *do* have to go all the way and report this by myself? Ahh, I didn’t sign up for all this running and sweat~!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata %}
Kaoru ran off. Still, it sounds like something troublesome is brewing, doesn’t it~?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora %}
Uumyu… I have a bad feeling about this. I hope nothing bad happens…

For now, let’s rush over to where we promised to meet Midori-kun and the transfer student!
