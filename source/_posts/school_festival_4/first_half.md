{% bubble Chiaki %}
Alright, glad to see you’re all here!

It’s time to discuss our thoughts for the school festival! Don’t hold back! Tell me any and all of your opinions…! ☆
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
Oh, you’re allowing opinions…? Then I say we don’t join the festival…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki %}
Well done, Takamine! Glad to hear your opinion first!

But I’ve already handed in the papers to the Student Council! We’re going to do a food truck, no matter what!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora %}
Huh? Not a food stall?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki %}
Yeah, there were way more food stalls than I thought. What do you guys want for the food? C’mon, c’mon~ Let me hear all your thoughts…♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
Ehhh… So you’re just gonna ignore *my* thought…

You’re the one who was like, “When it comes to festivals, you think food stalls!”, then decided on everything on your own… and now we’re all gonna be dragged into it… How about you think about how *we* feel…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki %}
My bad! I’ll make sure to do things after I’ve talked to you guys about it, so forgive me this once!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata v2 %}
*puka, puka*…♪ what is important is the [present], not the [past]. chiaki has learned his [lesson], so let it flow away with the [water]~

chiaki, i would like [fish] for the truck. sashimiii…♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki %}
Sashimi, huh… Hmm, raw food is probably a no for food safety reasons. Though I could ask the Student Council about it…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora %}
Taichou, Taichou! If raw food’s out, then we could just grill all'a it! Leave the grilling to me!!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki %}
Sorry to ruin your excitement, but absolutely not. We’ll only have a fire on our hands if you start grilling. You should never, ever deal with fire, okay? Promise me that…!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora %}
You’re exaggerating~ Right, guys?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shinobu %}
Weeell… After seeing Taichou-dono like that, it’s a little hard to comment……

Ermm, Taichou-dono. Our options will go down if we take grilling off the list.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
Um, first off. Can any of you even *cook*?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shinobu %}
I-I have not done it much, but I shall do my best!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata v2 %}
i am very [good] at preparing [fish]~♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki %}
I haven’t cooked much, either! But it’s okay! We can do it if we practice! ☆
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
Ahhh, dammit! So you really *didn’t* think this through…!

Morisawa-senpai, let’s at least drop the food truck idea… It’ll only be a disaster like this…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki %}
Don’t give up, Takamine! We just need it to be food we *can* make, right? Right, right! Our options have gone down by a lot!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora %}
Hmm, how 'bout cotton candy? We wouldn’t need to use fire, and we can make it without knowing how to cook, right?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki %}
Oh, cotton candy!? That’s a great idea! Alright, let’s do that! ☆
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora %}
Heheh, it’s a staple to do cotton candy for a stall~ Ah, but we’re doing a food truck instead, so maybe we should’ve gone for somethin’ more fancy?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki %}
I’m fine with this. With cotton candy, we could ask for bags with our faces printed on them, and advertise our unit!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
Don’t… I’ll tear every bag apart if you do that…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki %}
Don’t glare at me like that, you’re scaring me!

Alright, so now that we’ve settled on cotton candy… Our customers might starting feeling thirsty after something so sweet, so maybe we could sell juice, too.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shinobu %}
Ahh, I would be glad to have that~ I am in complete agreement. ♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata v2 %}
i am also fine with it~ make sure to have [mineral water] in the menu…♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki %}
Alright, then we’ll do cotton candy and juice. Heheh, I’m feeling more excited now that we’ve cleared up the details~♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora %}
Um, Taichou? Do you have a sec?

Taishou asked me 'bout something… If we have time for it, could we also do some patrolling around school?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki %}
You were asked, too? Mikejima-san told me the same thing.

It’s a favor to him, so… If they’re in a fix, I think we should help them out.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora %}
Oh, really? Then I can tell Taishou the good news~!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki %}
If we’re also going to do patrolling, then we’ll need to assign roles. Let’s discuss how we’ll do that next…♪
{% endbubble %}

## Chapter 2

{% bubble Tetora %}
Ermm, we have five people, so… Are we splitting up into a team with three people, and the other one with two?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki %}
Yeah. Oh, we may as well get people to know our unit while we patrol! Yeah, let’s do that!

If any of you come up with an idea, then tell us all about it…!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
You’re dragging us into something annoying again… Who cares about that… Can’t we just patrol normally…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki %}
You should care! There are all kinds of visitors coming — We can’t let this perfect chance slide!

For example… Hmm, we could wear a happi[^1] with “Ryuseitai” and our names written on it, or carry around signboards… How about it? It’ll attract attention for sure!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
Please don’t say stupid stuff like that… People from my neighborhood are gonna come to the festival — I’ll lose all will to live if they see me like that…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki %}
Ermm… I thought it was a good idea, though…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shinobu %}
Taichou-dono, Taichou-dono! How about doing some sort of skit in the midst of our patrol work?

Something like us saving someone surrounded by delinquents.

I saw a scene like that in the tokusatsu show you told me to watch, so it got stuck in my head.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki %}
Oh, that’s a great idea! You’re a good boy for doing your tokusatsu research!! <th><em>(pat pat pat)</em></th> ♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shinobu %}
Wawa— Please don’t pat my head~!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
It’ll make us stand out either way… Nothing’s changed…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora %}
A skit… Then how 'bout we do a hero show after?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki %}
Oohh!! What a bold idea! I like it! Yeah, we should do a hero show! Let me pat you too, Nagumo…☆
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora %}
Ughh, no thanks. And don’t hug me, either.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata v2 %}
but a [hero show] would require setting up a [stage], wouldn’t it?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki %}
Yep. We probably won’t be able to get the usual stage, but we could turn the staircase by the school building into a simple stage.

We’ll advertise our hero show while we patrol. Mhm, this way we can make ourselves known!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
Ughhh… Now it got worse…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki %}
Now, now! We become stronger with every hardship! That’s what being a hero’s all about…! ☆
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
We’re idols, not heroes… Wait no, being an idol is annoying too… Ughhh, everything about this is a big no… I just wanna die…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shinobu %}
You can’t die! Good things will happen to you if you live on. For me, meeting everyone is one of those good things~♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
You’re so bright that I can’t look directly at you…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki %}
We need to decide on the roles for the skit, then. We’ll put aside the hero role for now — Who’ll be the delinquent, and who’ll be the victim?

The delinquent role is the bad guy here, so I’ll do it if no one wants it.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora %}
Umm… Could I do it?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki %}
What’s wrong, Nagumo!? Aren’t you always saying how you want to become a man among men!?

Why would you want to be a delinquent…!?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora %}
Nah, there’s no real reason to it, it’s just… I thought it’d be kinda fun.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki %}
O-oh… Well, I’m glad to know you’re interested…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora %}
And anyway, it’s not like I suddenly lost sight of my “man among men” dream~
{% endbubble %}

## Chapter 3

{% bubble Chiaki %}
Alright. I thought we'd have the most trouble with this, but we've quickly settled the delinquent role, so what's left are the heroes and the victim!

We'll decide the heroes last. Who'll be the victim? Anyone here wants to do it?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shinobu %}
Standing out is a bit too embarrassing for me, so…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
Same…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata v2 %}
mm… so no one wants to do it… how about i [take] it?

yaaay! mr. [delinquent] is here~♪ would you like to eat [fish]?

[irritation] comes from [calcium deficiency], you see. you should eat lots of [fish]~♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shinobu %}
T-There is no sense of danger… I cannot comprehend why you are recommending him fish.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
Then how about if Morisawa-senpai does it…? Though that has its own problems…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shinobu %}
Hmm, he would simply try to deal with the danger by himself… We need someone similar to a frail girl, or something…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
Girl…? So like, the transfer student…?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shinobu %}
Yes, I suppose so. Though I do not know if she is “frail”…

Wh— Ow ow ow!?

Huh!? Transfer student-dono? W-When did you come behind me…? Please stop poking my head like that~!

A-Are you angry at me? I give, I give! Please forgive me~!

*Sniff*… I suffered such misfortune…

Though… Transfer student-dono, do you have something to do here?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki %}
Oh, so you were walking by the AV room when you heard a lot of noise, and came in to check what was going on? Mhm, I see! You came at the perfect moment!

You see, we’re planning this and that for the school festival, and have also decided to do a hero show.

We were just discussing how we’d like you to do the victim role for us.

Akehoshi has told me about it, so I’m already aware that you’re busy preparing Trickstar’s programme for the festival, but… If you could just help us a tinsy bit, then…

Hm? “Yes, I’d like to help if you need it”? Thank you, transfer student!

We’ve got ourselves someone for the victim role! It’s time for the role everyone’s been waiting for — The heroes! Heheh, I’m excited to see who’ll get to be this one~♪
{% endbubble %}

<div class="msr-location">
    <p><span><b>Location:</b> At the Fountain</span></p>
</div>

{% img /img/es/eventstory/schoolfestival4/3_1.jpg %}

<div class="msr-narration">
    <p>A few days later — After school…</p>
</div>

{% bubble Tetora %}
Midori-kuuun! Over here, c’mon~!

Shinkai-senpai said it’s okay to practice near the fountain, so we’re goin’ all out today~!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
Uhh, the fountain isn’t his domain or anything, so I don't think his approval even matters…?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora %}
I know, but… He’s always bathing in it, so I thought I should get his permission first.

Why *does* he do that, anyway? The first time I saw him doing it, I thought he was someone suspicious. I was this close to reporting him to someone.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
Ughh… Don’t ask me… Why not ask him instead…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora %}
I did, but it got me nowhere… He really is a mysterious one, huh?

Well, whatever, it’s time we start practicing. Transfer student-san isn’t here yet, so you do both the victim and hero role for now!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
Don’t just ask me for the impossible… Also, you called her over too…?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora %}
Ossu, I did! I asked her if she wanted to join us when I saw her on my way here, and she said yes!

So we may end up doing it together if she finishes her work in time!

Heheh! I’m so grateful that you’re also joining practice, Midori-kun~♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
I didn't have anything to do at home… And being bored means I’ll end up thinking about pointless things, which would only depress me… so I thought I should do something to help me relax, that’s all…

Ughhh… Why do *I* gotta do the hero role…

I’m sooooo depressed… I wanna dieeeeeeee…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora %}
You’re getting depressed either way…

You won in rock paper scissors, that’s why. Can’t do anything 'bout that.

Taichou totally looked like he wanted to do it, but he still said, “I lost, so of course I’d give the role to you!”

He didn’t back down from his words, even when you told him you didn’t want it… Kept saying it’s the winner’s right to have the role… It’s kinda surprising that he’d be stubborn 'bout these things.

Hm, since you and Shinkai-senpai got the role… Maybe I should’ve asked him to join practice, too.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
How about we don’t practice at all…? You’re really into this for some reason, but… It’s kiiinda weird…

I mean, have you ever been this serious about this sort of stuff before…?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora %}
Um— Well! My role’s the delinquent, yeah? So I’m not used to it! I gotta pump myself up~!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
Hmm… Eh, whatever… Maybe you can work hard for both of us, since I’ve got zero motivation for this…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora %}
Ah— Transfer student-san! Midori-kun, she’s here!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
Transfer student-san…♪ I’m so glad you’re here… Nagumo-kun pushed on me two roles at once, so I was this close to running away…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora %}
'Kay then! It’s time to get ourselves pumped~!
{% endbubble %}

## Chapter 4

{% img /img/es/eventstory/schoolfestival4/4_1.jpg %}

{% bubble Tetora %}
Yo, yo. Lady, why don’t ya come over with me a li’l?

Huh? “Where are we going”? Uhh… To the school store, I guess?

Oh, you will? Alright then, let’s go~! ♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
Umm… There’s no opportunity for the hero to show up…

Hm, actually, that’s just perfect…♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora %}
And they all lived happily ever after~♪

…Wait! No, no! What’s the point of a hero show when there’s no hero!?

You too, transfer student-san! You gotta start doin’ the scene where you shake me off, y’know!?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
Ehhh… *You're* the one who went along with what she said…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora %}
I-I just, y’know, accidentally got pulled in… Look, it doesn’t matter! We’re starting over again!

Yo, yo. Lady, why don’t ya come over with me a li’l?

Whaaa—!?? W-Why’re you grabbing my hand!? Please stop! I dunno how to deal with physical contact with girls~!

Huh? Ahh, this is supposed to be a forceful scene where I grab your arm, but since I didn’t do that, you did it yourself…?

Uuu… I’m so pathetic. I know I gotta be shameless with this, but I can’t do it! I’m too embarrassed~!

Maybe I gotta forget the part where you’re a girl… But, but… you *are* one, so…

Ughh… Nothing’s making sense to me anymore. Which only means one thing— Midori-kun, you gotta show me how it’s done!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
Uh, I dunno what the heck you mean by that…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora %}
Well, y’see~ You’ve got a pretty intimidating aura even when you’re just standing still with a blank look.

So you should try saying the delinquent line, too! You’ll totally be just like one!

Ahh, but you’re super handsome, so… I think a girl would gladly follow you instead…?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
I’m not made for this, though… I’m too timid… And you’re not timid yourself, but you don’t really feel delinquent-ish, Nagumo-kun…

It’s just an act, anyway… I don’t think we need to be that serious about it…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora %}
No way, I can’t just do this casually! I won’t become a man among men like that!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
Umm… Was this part of your “man among men” training or something…?

Huh—?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora %}
Midori-kun? What’s wrong, why’re you trembling…?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
Umm, there’s someone scary coming over here… S-Sorry, Nagumo-kun, but I just remembered I have something to do… Bye!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora %}
Huh!? Midori-kun!? Um, he just dashed away…?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kuro %}
Yo, Tetsu. Nice seein’ you here too, li’l miss.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora %}
Ah! Taishou\~! You came at the right moment! There’s somethin’ I wanna ask you\~!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kuro %}
Oh? That came outta nowhere… But sure, why not. I wanna pay back the favor, so ask me anything.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora %}
Huh!? Pay me back!? I don’t remember doing anything for you, though…?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kuro %}
You took the patrolling job, didn’t ya? Hasumi’s also really grateful.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora %}
No, no, there’s no need for that…! Taichou got the same request from Mikejima-senpai — that’s why it was accepted so easily!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kuro %}
Doesn’t matter, we’re still really thankful. Thanks, Tetsu.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora %}
T-Taishou… I’m so happy! Just hearing you say that gets me pumped up to work harder at my delinquent role~!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kuro %}
Delinquent role…? Oh yeah, what *were* you two doing together?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora %}
Oh y’see, we’re gonna do a skit in the middle of our patrolling. I was practicing for it just now!

Um, Taishou! What do I gotta do to become a cool delinquent!?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kuro %}
A cool delinquent…? I don’t get it, but… I really can’t advise you on anything 'bout acting.

My bad… I said you could ask me anything, but I still failed to help you out.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora %}
There’s never a time you’ve done that! And anyway, I should be *learning* the ways of a cool delinquent, not asking, right?

I’ll work really hard, and learn as much as I can to become a cool delinquent! So, Taishou! Please look forward to seeing it…! ☆
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kuro %}
O-Okay…?

What’s up, li’l miss? They’ve decided on my role for the Cinderella play?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora %}
Are you serious!? Who’re you gonna be…!?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kuro %}
The Second Prince…? Was there even someone like that in Cinderella…?

Oh, right, you did mention there’d be added roles… You must’ve been talking 'bout this one.

But me, as a prince…? You’re not messin’ around with me, right?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora %}
Taishou as a prince, huh~ You’re super cool, so you’ll be able to perfect the prince role~!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kuro %}
I told you already, I’ve never acted before… Oh well, what’s done is done. I’ll do the role.

Tetsu, li’l miss. I’ve got practice to do with the Drama Club members, so I’ll be off.

We’ve both gotten roles we’re not used to, but let’s work as best as we can, yeah?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shinobu %}
Ah— Taichou-dono! Good morning~♪

Ehehe, I thought I was the first one to arrive, but you always come much earlier!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki %}
Yep! This is the school festival we’ve all been waiting for, so I woke up as early as I could!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora %}
Oh? You two’re here already, huh? Oh well, good morning! ☆
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki %}
Good morning! …Hm? Nagumo, you came over with Takamine, huh?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora %}
Ahh, I met him on the way here, so we came together.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata v2 %}
good mooorning~…♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki %}
K-Kanata!? You always arrive on the last minute, and sometimes you’re completely late — Yet you came really early today, huh!?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata v2 %}
huh? was i? hmm~ i thought i would not make it on time, so i hurried over here…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki %}
That isn’t a problem at all! Anyhow, we’re all here now, so let’s head over to the food truck.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora %}
Woohoo\~! Can’t wait\~♪ This is my first time getting in one, so I’m really excited!
{% endbubble %}

Now then, the truck’s this way. Everyone, follow me…☆

You guys are looking great!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora %}
No no, wait… You suddenly told us to wear this so we did, but… when did you even get these?
{% endbubble %}

We’re going to help patrol around the school festival, right? So we got these outfits as reward. And we even have outfits for our truck!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora %}
Oooh. So you didn’t ask Taishou for the outfits this time, right?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki %}
Yeah, he’s busy with a bunch of stuff, after all. I couldn’t bear to ask him.

Same with the transfer student… I was really unsure of what to do at first, so this really saved us!

{% bubble Tetora %}
Midori-kun~? You’ve been quiet this whole time. It’s pretty scary when you’re quiet and not doing your usual “I’m so depressed, I wanna die” thing, y’know?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
Ah no, I’ve been trying to figure out a way to get away from all this…

Ahh dammit, I wish this school festival didn’t even *exist*…!!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shinobu %}
Midori-kun, Midori-kun! We’re getting customers soon enough, so you can’t show that kind of face, okay~?

Everyone would just run away!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki %}
Yeah, looks like we got a few customers while we were busy changing. Sengoku, Nagumo and I will patrol around the area, so I’ll leave the food truck tending to Kanata and Takamine.

Right, and we’re off! We’ll protect Yumenosaki Academy’s peace…♪

<th>(Ughhh, they all left… And now I’m all alone with Shinkai-senpai…)</th>

<th>(Mmm… I don’t get anything he does…)</th>

<th>(He’s been humming some “splish-splash yip-yay~♪” song, so I seriously don’t have a single clue about what he’s thinking…)</th>

<th>(I’m already not that great at communication, and now you’re telling me to tend a stall with a weird senior? That’s just too much for me…)</th>

Huh? Ahh, are you a customer…? Um, welcome…

Shinkai-senpai, I’ll make the cotton candy, so… You should prepare the orange juice…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata v2 %}
here you go~ nice, cold [water]~♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
You’re confusing the customer… Let’s change spots, Shinkai-senpai…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata v2 %}
fufufu, [white] cotton [candy] is pretty, isn’t it\~? but i like [blue] the most. it is the color of the [ocean], after all\~♪

here you go\~ a bright [blue] cotton [candy], just like the [ocean]\~♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
Shinkai-senpai, quit ignoring the orders…

Huh? This cotton candy is prettier…? Uh… Well, if you say so… Umm, thank you very much…

<th>(W-we managed to do it somehow… But are we really going to be okay like this…?)</th>

*Sigh*… I wanna go home…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata v2 %}
midori~ i see you are [sighing]. please take a look at this child, and [cheer] up.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
Huh? What’s this?

It looks so cute and strangely mascot character-like…♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata v2 %}
it is a stuffed toy of a [scotoplanes]~ i could give it to you if you like it.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
A-Are you sure…? It’s so cute — Isn’t it precious to you?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata v2 %}
ufufu. you say that, but you are hugging it tightly, you know~…♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
There’s no way I *wouldn’t* hug this…☆ Ahh, it’s so soothing…♪

Thank you, Shinkai-senpai. You really are kind—!?

<th>(H-He’s gone! Whaa— Where did he go…? What do I do, what do I do…! A customer’s here…!!)</th>

W-Welcome… Cotton candy and melon juice, right…?

And that customer wants cotton candy and grape juice… Huh? Apple juice, too…?

<th>(I-I can’t…! There’s no way I can do this on my own…!)</th>

<th>(S-Shinkai-senpai, come back…! Ahhh jeez, it doesn’t even have to be him—Someone just come here~!)</th>

{% img /img/es/eventstory/schoolfestival4/6_1.jpg %}

{% bubble Shinobu %}
Garden Terrace, all clear. I shall proceed onwards to the next area!

<th>(Ehehe, we received walkie-talkies from the Student Council — it makes everything feel so much more professional~♪)</th>

<th>(It’s much better for me to patrol alone rather than with everyone else, as I excel at collecting intelligence. I’m glad I suggested the idea to Taichou-dono!)</th>

<th>(Fufufu~ This is how I will show my true abilities~♪)</th>

…Hmm?

<th>(Ah! That looks like transfer student-dono! Alright! Time to say hello~♪)</th>
{% endbubble %}

{% img /img/es/eventstory/schoolfestival4/6_2.jpg %}

{% bubble Kaoru %}
Yoohoo yoohoo, transfer student-chan! What’s up~? Why’re you here?

I’m currently trying to pull in customers to our cafe, see.

Hm? Then I should go to a place where people are around, instead of being here?

Well y’see~ That area’s been left for doggie, so~

I purposely stepped away from that area, and now I got to meet you… I’m so lucky~♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shinobu %}
<th>(Hmm, someone did it before I could. That person is acting strangely friendly with her…)</th>

<th>(It feels as if transfer student-dono is not sure what to do with him, either. Should I go in there and help her?)</th>
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kaoru %}
Hey, hey, transfer student-chan. You remember our promise, right?

Mhm mhm, I’m glad to hear that~ I’ll make sure to escort you to the cafe, so look forward to it, ‘kay? ♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shinobu %}
<th>(Ahh—! She is not one to show any emotion, and yet she is making a perplexed face right now…!)</th>

<th>(I-I must save her! But but, I feel anxious doing it alone~! I-I shall contact the others for the time being!)</th>
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata v2 %}
ding…♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kaoru %}
Ow—!? That was such a soft way to say it, but you genuinely went and chopped me hard, Kanata-kun…!!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata v2 %}
ufufu, [naughty children must] be punished~ you should not trouble [transfer student]-san, okay?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kaoru %}
“Naughty children”? I’m your age, y’know~? And I’m not doing that, anyway.

We were just having a nice chat. Right, transfer student-chan?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata v2 %}
hmm. she is clearly saying otherwise, though?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kaoru %}
Whaa~? Sorry, sorry. I wasn’t trying to do that, really.

Ah, and now you’re hiding behind Kanata-kun…

I won’t pester you anymore, so come on over to my side~ Come on~♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata v2 %}
ahaha… she is shaking her head and completely [refusing]. it seems you are hated.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kaoru %}
Wha— No, I’m not! Why’d you go and say something I’ve been worrying about, huh!?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata v2 %}
you were worried about that? i am sorry, i did not notice.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kaoru %}
It’s fine, I guess. Anyway, why’re you here? Didn’t you say you guys were doing a food truck?

Ahh, but you also said something about patrolling, right? What a load of work that must be~ If it were me, I’d have skipped it to go and flirt with girls.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata v2 %}
you really love [girls], don’t you, kaoru. but that still does not mean you should flirt with [girls] that clearly do not like it.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kaoru %}
Alright, alright. All I gotta do is *not* bother transfer student-chan anymore, right?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata v2 %}
ufufu, let me praise you. good boy, good boy…♪

kaoru, i think i [need] to leave for now.

i left my spot to [rehydrate], but that also means i left midori alone to [tend] the truck.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kaoru %}
Guess I’ll leave too, then~ I’ve also left most of the work to Sakuma-san, so~. We may be having our cafe indoors, but it’s noon right now, so it must be rough on him.

Transfer student-chan, see you later~ I await your return, my princess~♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata v2 %}
now then, it is time i head back to midori.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shinobu %}
U-Uuuu~ Transfer student-dono~…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata v2 %}
huh? shinobu? since when were you here~?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shinobu %}
I was here this whole time…

I noticed transfer student-dono was feeling awkward around that person, but I was too anxious to do anything…

It went alright thanks to you, Shinkai-dono, but… I deeply apologize for failing to save you, transfer student-dono!

Y-You forgive me? Ehehe, you are truly kind~♪

Shinkai-dono, I shall return with you. It’s probably time for us to switch places, anyway.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata v2 %}
it is that [time] already~? transfer student-san, we will be off now.

please do enjoy the [school festival]. *puka, puka*…♪
