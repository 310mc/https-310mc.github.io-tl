{% bubble Tetora %}
Ossu! Nagumo Tetora, comin' in!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kuro %}
…………
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora %}
<th>(Ooh, he hasn't noticed me at all. I think he's concentrating on something — maybe I should let him be for now…)</th>
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kuro %}
…Hm? Oh — it's you, Tetsu. Sorry 'bout that. How long have you been here?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora %}
Ahaha, only a second. You’ve got awesome concentration skills, Taishou~!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kuro %}
Nah… I'm just so outta it that I didn't realize you were here.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora %}
Uumyu… Is there something bothering you again?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kuro %}
Mm… It's more like I'm worried 'bout something.

Akatsuki's gonna help the Drama Club during the school festival, right? But I didn't expect we’d be helpin' them as actors.

I was just readin' through the script, and—
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora %}
Uu~ I'm so sorry, Taishou!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kuro %}
…? Why're you apologizing?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora %}
I'm the one who suggested you to help the Drama Club… and now my idea’s backfired on you!

I'm really, really sorry for putting stress on you!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kuro %}
Don't keep apologizin’. This is my own problem. I'm thankful for your suggestion… It's savin’ our butts right now.

Now that we’re doin’ it, I wanna get it right, but I've never acted before. If it were somethin’ like a delinquent role, though… I could've done it without even needing to “act” it out.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora %}
Oohh… You’d be super duper cool as a delinquent! I wanna see that~!

Oh yeah, I heard that you used to be a rebel in the past. Is that true?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kuro %}
Hm? Yeah, in the past… Anyways, Tetsu. Did you guys decide on what to do for the festival?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora %}
Ossu! We went for a food stall!

We're still not sure how exactly we'll do one… But Taichou told us to meet up in the AV room tomorrow, so I guess we'll be deciding on it then.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kuro %}
That so? I'll come by the stall if I've got the time.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora %}
Oh yes, please do! You're always welcome~!

I also wanna see you performing! I'll totally find the time to see you!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kuro %}
I'm glad, but I'd rather you didn't. I don't wanna disappoint you with bad acting.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora %}
I'd never be disappointed with any version of you~
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kuro %}
Haha, thanks.

Hrm… A food stall, huh… Maybe it'd be too much on top of that…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora %}
Hmm? What's too much?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kuro %}
See, apparently there's not enough people to patrol the school during the festival.

I kinda overheard Hasumi talking 'bout it… I thought I could help out a little, but — I'll be too busy with the performance, so I doubt I'll have any time to patrol.

That’s when I thought maybe you guys could help out instead.

Ryuseitai's 'bout being allies of justice, so a duty to maintain public order would suit you all perfectly, yeah?

But, well… This isn't your problem to deal with. Hopefully they'll find people for the job, so forget what I just said.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora %}
No, no! I'll ask Taichou in the meeting tomorrow!

We may find the time to patrol while we do our food stall… Also, I wanna make it happen since it's a favor to you!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kuro %}
Thanks, Tetsu. Yeah, could you ask Morisawa 'bout it?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora %}
Will do! And if he says it’s impossible, then I'll do whatever it takes to make him say it *isn't*! Even if I gotta get on my knees and beg!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kuro %}
Mmm… I know it's dumb to say this right after asking for a favor, but you don't gotta if you really can't, alright?

Right then, time to start practice. You came here for that too, right?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora %}
You sure you're all good for the performance act?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kuro %}
Yeah, they haven't even decided on the roles, so… It's only gonna stiffen me up more if I keep reading the script. I'm starting to feel like movin' my body, anyway.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora %}
Wooo! I'm so happy! 'Kay, I'll go change my clothes then! ☆
