<th>(O-Oh no… This is where we were supposed to meet, right…?)</th>

<th>(Uuu~ But no one’s here… What do I do…? Should I call Nagumo-kun…?)</th>

Huh…?

<th>(Is that the transfer student…? Yup, that definitely looks like her…)</th>

<th>(It’s good that she’s here, but we can’t perform our act without Nagumo-kun… Guess I really should call him…)</th>

…………

<th>(Mmm~ He’s not picking up… Oh well, I guess I’ll explain the current situation to the transfer studen—)</th>

……Huh?

<th>(Some bad-looking guys are talking to her, I think…? Whaa… Why’re there guys like that in our school…?)</th>

<th>(Wait, no— This isn’t the time to think! I have to go save her…!)</th>

<th>(Uuu… I have to, but my legs won’t stop shaking… I can’t do it…)</th>

<th>(Nagumo-kun, please pick up the phone…! I can’t do this alone…!)</th>

<th>(Ah— She’s about to be taken away…!)</th>

<th>(Ahh!! It’s now or never, Takamine Midori…! If you desert her now, you’ll regret it for the rest of your life…!)</th>

S-Stop…! Don’t you dare lay a hand on her…!!

<th>(Ahh… They’re glaring at me… Are they gonna hit me…?)</th>

<th>(I don’t wanna get hurt… I’m terrified, and my legs are trembling… But somehow, I don’t regret doing this at all…)</th>

<th>(Maybe I’ve done enough, then… I’m sorry I couldn’t save you heroically, transfer student-san…)</th>

“The green flame is the mark of compassion… Healing everyone with things like mascot characters… Ryusei Green, Takamine Midori…”
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki %}
“With the five of us together, we are Ryuseitai…!”
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
Aghh, there’s way too much attention on us… I said my line, so it’s alright for me to go in a corner where no one can see me, right…?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shinobu %}
Ahaha, I completely understand how you feel. I do not want to stand out much, either.

And anyway, Midori-kun, you may say that now, but—

Just earlier, you protected transfer student-dono from the delinquents, did you not? You really stood out in the crowd then.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
Ughh… I really wanted to run away back then, though… They were terrifying…

Even I think I managed that way too well… I don’t typically have that much guts in me… Maybe I experienced that thing where you get tremendous courage at any sign of danger…?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shinobu %}
You were super cool~♪ All the girls had hearts in their eyes!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
Mm~… It’s true that I was the first one to jump in there, but the ones who drove them away were you guys, y’know…?

I’m kinda late on saying this, but thank you, everyone…♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora %}
No need to thank me! I’d be a disgrace as a man if I were to abandon a comrade in danger!

…I made a huge mistake.

When I heard that Taishou was a delinquent in the past… I thought they were super cool people.

But… reality showed me otherwise. They’re not cool at all.

Delinquents aren’t anything like Taishou.

There are super uncool delinquents out there… In fact, it’s Taishou who’s the only exception.

There are plenty who aren’t considerate, and just do as they like… I finally understood that today.
{% endbubble %}

## Chapter 2

{% bubble Shinobu %}
But, you know… Although we were unable to follow through our original plan, since an actual delinquent appeared…

In the end, we were still able to save a frail transfer student-dono from delinquents.

In a way, something good came from an unfortunate incident. We even managed to get more people to come to our hero show, and now we have a full crowd.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
If only this part of our plan got ruined, too… *Sigh*… I really wish that had happened…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora %}
Mm~ I’d rather have this than not having everyone’s attention on us!

We’re idols, after all — It’s important to stand out. We gotta stand out even more, and make this whole crowd remember our names!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
Noooo… I don’t wannaaaaa…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shinobu %}
Oh jeez, Midori-kun! You’ve been standing out for a while now, so just accept your fate already! Heheh~ I’m feeling super excited~♪
{% endbubble %}

{% img /img/es/eventstory/schoolfestival4/tetorabcg.jpg %}

{% bubble Tetora %}
Ossu! I’m gonna sing as loud as I can!

“I’m Nagumo Tetora, Ryusei Black! Follow my lead, everyone…!”

“♪\~♪\~♪”
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki %}
Ooh! What a powerful voice! Nice, Ryusei Black! You’re doing great, Ryusei Black…! ☆
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora %}
Don’t pat my head. The show’s not over yet, so don’t start relaxing.

Also… Sorry for making you feel anxious, Taichou.

I kept saying how much I wanna be a cool delinquent, and never bothered to look around me.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki %}
No, it’s alright. It seems like you don’t want to become one anymore, and that’s enough.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora %}
Yeah! I’m actually kinda glad I didn’t get to act out my role in the end.

And, seriously… I never wanna come across another real delinquent ever again.

I was almost petrified in my spot when I saw them ganging up on Midori-kun and the transfer student.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki %}
But you didn't stop, so that you could save them. You’re a wonderful hero, Nagumo! You were so cool! I’m so proud of you!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora %}
Like I *said!* Don’t pat my head! Should we even be talking in the middle of our performance, anyway?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki %}
No, I’m pretty sure we shouldn’t be.

Ahaha! In our school’s live shows, it’s become a tradition to talk in the middle of them! Looks like it’s now something I do, too!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora %}
That’s not funny! We’ve got little kids here, so they might get bored and leave if we keep talking to each other!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki %}
That would be a shame! In fact, this is a hero show for *kids!* We shouldn’t forget about our purpose here!
{% endbubble %}

{% img /img/es/eventstory/schoolfestival4/chiakibcg.jpg %}

{% bubble Chiaki %}
“Children, watch over our heroic figures! Now then, let’s get this hero show going~!”

“♪\~♪\~♪”
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shinobu %}
Taichou-dono is performing with so much energy~ He’s jumping around while singing… Does he not get tired?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora %}
Mmm~ I think he’s got a different amount of stamina from us… It frustrates me to say this, but my performance a second ago took a lot outta me, so I’m gonna stay in the back to recover some of my energy.

I’ll leave the rest to you and Midori-kun.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shinobu %}
Okay! You lit a fire in us, after all~ All we have to do now is make that fire burn even more!

“♪\~♪\~♪”

C’mon, c’mon! It is your turn now, Midori-kun~♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
N-No, I’m fine… I’m just gonna stay here where no one can see me…

<th>(Ahh, but everyone’s having fun performing… This isn’t the right time to be fighting against it, I guess…)</th>
{% endbubble %}

{% img /img/es/eventstory/schoolfestival4/midoribcg.jpg %}

{% bubble Midori %}
<th>(Just what is *up* with today… Every time I don’t wanna stand out, I stand out even more…)</th>

<th>(Ahh~! Dammit, I don’t care anymore…!)</th>

“♪\~♪\~♪”
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata v2 %}
midori~♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
Huh? W-Why are you calling out to me…? Ah, am I in your way…?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata v2 %}
no, you would never be in my [way]~ the five of us together are ryuseitai, after all.
{% endbubble %}

{% img /img/es/eventstory/schoolfestival4/kanatabcg.jpg %}

{% bubble Kanata v2 %}
people become happy every time we do something. and when people enjoy what we do, we also become happy.

“♪\~♪\~♪”
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
<th>(Huh? Huh? Did he call out to me just because I was nearby…?)</th>

<th>(He’s a strange one… But the kids seem to like him…?)</th>

<th>(They’re cheering him on whenever he does a hero pose…)</th>

<th>(Huh? Is that kid trying to tell me to go for it…?)</th>

<th>(A kid just cheered me on… But, that does make me a bit happy, I think…)</th>

<th>(Even I don’t want any of these kids’ smiles ruined… That’s why, I’ll try to work as hard as I can…♪)</th>
