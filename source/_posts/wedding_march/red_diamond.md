<div class="msr-narration">
    <p>Time passes until November. In the morning…</p>
</div>

{% bubble Jun v3 %}
…Ah, Morisawa-senpai. The staff gave me an update~

They’re still doing the final check-up around the place, but we’ll start filming as soon as they’re done.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki %}
Thank you! Sorry that I made you go all the way to ask them, Sazanami.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Jun v3 %}
It’s all good\~ I’m used to running errands for other people ‘cause of Ohii-san. Besides, I was the one who offered to do it, anyway\~♪

Now that that’s settled… The Golden Pavilion’s real neat, huh~?

I’m not smart enough to pick the right words here, but… I guess this is what you’d call “elegant”~?

And we get to enjoy the scenery all for ourselves right as it opens, so it feels all even more special~
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki %}
Mhm! So much has happened just to get here, but I’m so glad to know we were able to make it to this day. It’s truly touching…! ☆
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Jun v3 %}
Ahaha, it’s too early to celebrate\~ We haven’t even filmed our introductions yet, y’know\~? I get what you mean, though.

It took a real long time to get to this point, didn’t it~ Tenshouin-senpai himself was pretty shocked like, “I didn’t expect you to suggest a *variety show* of all things”.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki %}
Haha, he was even surprised that we managed to find four other idols to accompany us. I was worried at first over how our schedules would align, but…

Thanks to the P-Association’s assistance, we were able to ensure that both the filming and its public release will happen in autumn.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Jun v3 %}
I was surprised to hear “P-Association” pop up in the conversation, but I’m real glad they’re helping us out with this project.

Without Anzu-san’s comments, we would’ve never noticed that our project was turning out to just be a regular ol’ travel program.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki %}
Mhm! We kept having meetings together until we finally came up with a project that would satisfy everyone involved—

So I’m sure it’ll be a success! Rather, we’ll absolutely make certain that it becomes a success!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Yuzuru %}
…Ah, that’s where the two of you are.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki %}
Oh, Fushimi! Where’s everyone else?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Yuzuru %}
They are still having their make-up done. I believe they will be finished soon.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki %}
Ah, alright! We’re already such a large group, so I didn’t expect to have you onboard too, Fushimi! It feels reassuring! ☆
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Yuzuru %}
Yes, I’m here under Eichi-sama’s orders to act as an emergency contact.

While I do plan to participate in the filming, I will be taking a step back from everyone, so please pay no mind to me.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki %}
No, don’t be that way — we’re all equals here!

You’re part of the team, so you’re free to take as many steps forward as you like!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Yuzuru %}
Hm… The six of you are the ones who will be in the spotlight this time, so I would rather not stand out…

However, it is true that I may unintentionally worry our fans if they were to see me separated from everyone.

Therefore, I will be sure to display myself in moderation.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki %}
That’s the spirit! I expect great things from you, Fushimi!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shu frown %}
…You truly are noisy, Morisawa. Have you considered staying quiet for once, at least before our work begins?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tatsumi %}
I’m sorry to have kept you all waiting, everyone. The staff members seem to have finished the preparations, so I believe it’s time for the briefing.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki %}
It’s finally time…! I don’t intend on pushing Ryuseitai’s way of doing things onto you all, but—

*All for one, one for all!* Let’s join hands and make this project a success! ☆
{% endbubble %}

## Chapter 2

{% img /img/es/eventstory/weddingmarch/red2_1.jpg %}

{% bubble Jin sigh2 %}
*Sigh…* Why do I gotta babysit when I’m in <em>Kyoto</em>…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Akiomi %}
We are here specifically to do that “babysitting”. Just to let you know, it’s completely alright to go home if you’d rather not do it. I can be the host on my own.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Jin frown %}
No way, with <em>this</em> many people? There’s no way you can manage it all on your own, Akiyan. Don’t ya agree, Anzu?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Akiomi frown %}
Please don’t coerce Anzu-san into agreeing with you. And I suggest that you avoid spoiling Jin, Anzu-san.

…I can see the group now. Once they’re done with the briefing, it’s time to begin filming.

Anzu-san, we’re entrusting you with all the behind-the-scenes arrangements.
{% endbubble %}

<div class="msr-narration">
    <p>Ten minutes later — They begin recording the upcoming online stream…</p>
</div>

{% bubble Jin %}
“Ermm, so, to everyone watching this stream… Heya, I’m Sagami Jin.”
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Akiomi %}
“Hello, I’m Kunugi Akiomi. We will be your hosts for this show. It’s a pleasure to be here.”

“Now then, I believe there was already an explanation at the studio, but this show is not simply just about a short trip.”

“The first half of the first day will be the ‘sightseeing segment,’ where we will show the audience what you’re doing at the tourist attractions. The second half of the day will feature the ‘game segment,’ involving competitions.”

“For the game segment, you will compete in pairs.”

“The pairs will be decided based on a lottery, so we will have different pairs for each day.”

“Furthermore, you are allowed to make a ‘call’ once a day, to ask an acquaintance for help.”

“The only rule is that it must be an ES idol. Otherwise, you’re free to speak to them about anything. Please make use of it whenever you need it.”

“The idol with the most points by the end will receive a reward.”

“The prize is domestic travel tickets for your whole unit. Please do your utmost best in the show.”
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble MakotoChiaki %}
Yaay!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble JunTatsumi %}
Yaay~
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble YuzuruNagisa %}
…Yaay♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shu norsmile %}
…♪ <em><th>(smiles while nodding)</th></em>
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki idle %}
Mm? I didn’t hear you say “yay,” Itsuki! It’s part of the script to say it, y’know?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shu frown %}
Hmph! It isn’t in my character to do that.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki angry %}
Hrmph…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shu frown %}
What are you making that face for? I’m not your parent, and I’ve no interest in taking part in this foolish charade.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Jin %}
“Haha, looks like we can skip past loosening your nerves, huh? Okay then, it’s time to decide on your pairs.”
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki grin %}
*<th>(raises hand)</th>* Sagami-sensei, sir! We can’t make pairs out of seven people!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Jin %}
“Ahaha, great job on showing how to properly make a comment. It’s as Morisawa said — One person’s gonna be left without a partner.”

“That’s why we’ll have a guest idol show up only for the game segment. I hope you’re all excited to see who it is.”

“Right then, time to draw the lottery~”
{% endbubble %}

<div class="msr-narration">
    <p>A few minutes later…</p>
</div>

{% bubble Makoto %}
Mine is blank… Ah, that means I’ll be paired with the guest idol, huh.

Hmm, I wonder who it’ll be…? I hope it’s someone I’m on good terms with.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tatsumi %}
…My partner appears to be Shu-san.

I’ve heard a great deal about you. Natsume-san sometimes mentions you during our Gardenia activities.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shu v2 %}
From that boy…? How on earth did I end up being mentioned…? He wasn’t telling any untruths, was he?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tatsumi %}
I haven’t spoken to you much before, so I wouldn’t be able to confirm what is and isn’t factual, but…

I’m given the impression that you are someone special to him. He always looks so happy when talking about you.

I would love to take this opportunity to get to know you more. Let’s do our best together, Shu-san.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Yuzuru %}
I see that I’m partnered with Ran-sama. It is a pleasure to make your acquaintance.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Nagisa v2 %}
…Mhm. The pleasure is all mine.

…This is my first time on a field trip, so I’m really excited.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Jun v3 %}
<th>(Mm~… Nagi-senpai’s partner is Fushimi-san, huh…)</th>

<th>(I’ve got no clue why, but I do know Ibara has some hostility with him, so… I dunno what to expect once he finds out…)</th>

<th>(Oh well. I can’t be assed to think about it right now, and them’s the rules, so nothing I can do about it anyway…)</th>

We were a pair for the PV, and a pair again here, huh\~ I’m glad to work with you, Morisawa-senpai\~♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki %}
Mhm! While we may be rivals competing for points, we’re on the same team today!

Let’s join forces and get those points! ☆
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Akiomi %}
“Yuuki-kun is still awaiting his ‘guest idol’ partner, but I can see that the ‘Morisawa &amp; Sazanami Pair,’ ‘Kazehaya &amp; Itsuki Pair,’ and ‘Ran &amp; Fushimi Pair’ have all finished greeting each other. Very well then—”
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki %}
Hold it right there!

Calling us by our family names is too cheap. We need to come up with a pair name to strengthen our solidarity!

What would you like our name to be, Sazanami?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Jun v3 %}
Hmm, I’m fine with anything. Feel free to choose whatever you like, Senpai.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki %}
Hmm…

Okay then! We’re going to be the “Effort! Friendship! Victory! Fiery☆Hero Pair”! ☆
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Jin yare %}
“Hold on, that’s <em>way</em> too long… Can’t you make it something that won’t be exhausting to say?”
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki smile3 %}
Hrmph… Alright, then I’ll make it “Fiery☆Pair”!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tatsumi %}
What shall we make ours, Shu-san?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shu v2 %}
I’d prefer to keep it as “Kazehaya &amp; Itsuki Pair”. It’s only for today, anyway.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tatsumi %}
Understood. Then we will stay as is.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Yuzuru %}
Ran-sama, what shall we choose?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Nagisa v2 %}
…I’d like “Grapevine Pair”. It’s the fruit of the season, and grapes have a dreamy quality to them.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Yuzuru %}
Dreamy quality…?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Nagisa v2 %}
…Kaoru-kun told me about it.[^1] I didn’t fully understand, but…

…He said “life is more fun when you believe in those dreams”.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Yuzuru %}
Ohh… I don’t quite understand either, but you’d like us to be “Grapevine Pair,” yes? Very well then.

What shall you choose, Yuuki-sama?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Makoto %}
Hmm… I’m going to decide on a pair name after I meet up with my partner.

I wouldn’t want to choose something that doesn’t suit our image, after all.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Akiomi %}
“It appears everyone has chosen a pair name for themselves. Right then—”

“It’s time to begin the sightseeing segment at the Golden Pavilion.”
{% endbubble %}

## Chapter 3

<div class="msr-narration">
    <p>A while later…</p>
</div>

{% bubble Shu norsmile %}
…The Golden Pavilion is blinding, so I typically prefer the Silver Pavilion, but…

The actual sight of it is beautiful. Footage alone is truly incapable of capturing the scent and atmosphere of the place.

This experience alone makes visiting here worthwhile.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tatsumi curious %}
……………
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shu v2 %}
…Why are you inclining your head?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tatsumi %}
Well, I started to wonder — Why does the first floor of the Golden Pavilion not have a gold-leaf coating?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shu v2 %}
There are various theories, but it’s said that the Golden Pavilion was built with the purpose of showing off those in positions of authority at the time.

The evidence for this is the phoenix on the roof — which is said to present itself when the emperor appears — and the architectural style that you pointed out.

It is also said that each floor is divided into distinct styles to show the power hierarchy. The phoenix and the third floor are for the most powerful people; the second floor is for the samurai…

And the lowest floor — the first floor — is for the aristocrats. The lack of the  gold-leaf coating on the lowest floor is an indication of the first two storeys superiority over the nobles.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tatsumi %}
You’re very knowledgeable about it, aren’t you? Are you fond of this kind of architecture?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shu yare %}
It’s simply part of my study. The fine arts are a combination of many components.

However, I am no expert, and what I explained is only one of the common theories. If you wish to learn more, do your own research.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tatsumi %}
You’re right, that I will do. Thank you very much for explaining it to me, Shu-san.

…Oh? Chiaki-san and Jun-san are here.

What are you two doing?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Jun v3 %}
Ah, Tatsumi-senpai. We were just chatting while looking at the carps in the pond.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tatsumi %}
Chatting?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki %}
Yep! I was talking about how last year, Ryuseitai performed a live show to find a caretaker for a carp.[^2]
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tatsumi curious %}
You performed a live show rather than making a poster to search for a new owner…?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Jun v3 %}
Ahaha, even Tatsumi-senpai thought the same, huh\~ That’s what I said, too\~♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki %}
My juniors in Ryuseitai thought up the idea after a lot of brainstorming. With a live show, they’d be able to spread the news to a lot of people faster.

They were hoping they could save the carp after having been abandoned without a home.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shu v2 %}
…Well? Were you able to find someone to take custody of it?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki grin %}
Yeah. Apparently, there’s a pond in the temple of Hasumi’s home. That’s where they got to keep it safe.

Of course, if they had simply talked to Hasumi about it, they wouldn’t have needed to hold a live show, but… seeing the kids’ hard work rewarded with my own two eyes meant a lot to me.

So I consider it a really special memory.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tatsumi %}
Fufu, thank you for sharing such a beautiful story.

Speaking of carps… A local told me about this earlier, but there apparently is a waterfall with a stone that looks like a carp. What do you say we go a little further to see it?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki %}
That sounds intriguing! Let’s go check it out!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Jin %}
“It looks like the Fiery☆Pair and Kazehaya &amp; Itsuki Pair are going to the waterfall.”
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Akiomi %}
“The Grapevine Pair and Yuuki-kun… appear to be strolling a little far from the Golden Pavilion.”
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Nagisa curious %}
…? Such a charming design for this entrance’s curtains. What sort of establishment is this?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Makoto %}
Erm… It looks like it’s a place to experience tea etiquette.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Nagisa v2 %}
…Tea etiquette?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Makoto %}
Ah, maybe it’d be clearer if I had said “tea ceremony”…? It’s part of Japan’s traditional culture to make tea in a specific manner.

It’s not just about drinking the tea, but also a way to discipline yourself to polish your spirituality and manners and such.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Nagisa v2 %}
…How intriguing. You can learn how to maintain manners and spirituality through tea.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Makoto %}
How about we try it out while we’ve got the chance?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Nagisa curious %}
…We didn’t book beforehand. Would it still be alright?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Makoto %}
The signboard says walk-in entries are fine too, so it should be okay.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Yuzuru %}
Allow me to confirm that with the establishment. Please wait here.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Nagisa v2 %}
…Okay. I’ll be waiting.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Makoto %}
…Oh, he’s back. What’d they say, Fushimi-kun?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Yuzuru %}
They said they have an empty spot, so we would be able to make it if we were to head over there straight away.

We still have time before we have to meet up with everyone. How about we spend our time there?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Makoto %}
Mhm, I like that idea~♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Jin %}
“Those three are off to try out a tea ceremony, huh~ What an elegant thing to do for a bunch of youngsters.”
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Akiomi frown %}
“You will sound like an old man if you say ‘youngsters,’ you know?”

“The short trip has only just begun. Please do enjoy watching the idols entertain themselves.”
{% endbubble %}

## Chapter 4

<div class="msr-location">
    <p><span><b>Location:</b> Near the Togetsukyo Bridge in Arashiyama</span></p>
</div>

{% img /img/es/eventstory/weddingmarch/red4_1.jpg %}

<div class="msr-narration">
    <p>The same day…</p>
</div>

{% bubble Yuzuru %}
The color of autumn is thriving here too, isn’t it?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Nagisa v2 %}
…Yes. It looks just like a red diamond.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Makoto %}
Red diamond?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Nagisa v2 %}
…It’s a type of diamond. There are various other kinds of red jewels, such as ruby, garnet, spinel…

…But this is likely going to be our only opportunity to witness this scenery as the three of us.

…So I believe that the red diamond suits this scenery the most, as it is the rarest of all diamonds.

…? What’s wrong with that boat over there? Is it laying still due to the slow current of the river?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Makoto %}
That’s a houseboat.[^3] The reason why it looks slow is because it’s moved by poking the bottom of the river with a bamboo pole.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Nagisa v2 %}
…You know a lot, don’t you?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Makoto %}
Ahaha, I got curious as well, so I did some quick research on my phone~♪

According to the Kyoto guide site, it was a common way for aristocrats to spend their time in the olden days.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Nagisa v2 %}
…Hm. Perhaps I’d be able to know how it was for the people back then through that boat.

…I’d love to ride on it, but it doesn’t seem possible with that queue.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Yuzuru %}
…Unfortunately so. I looked through the reservations online, and it seems to be fully booked.

I apologize for being unable to help.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Nagisa v2 %}
…Not at all. Thank you for checking for my sake. Tourism is rather high during this time of year, so I’m sure we would have had to book days in advance.

…It’s unfortunate that we can’t try one this time, but I’ll reserve my curiosity for the next opportunity.

…I hope I can come here again with my unit members. I’ll have to work hard on the game segment to make that a reality.
{% endbubble %}

<div class="msr-narration">
    <p>Meanwhile, elsewhere…</p>
</div>

{% bubble Tatsumi %}
…………
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shu v2 %}
…………
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tatsumi awkward %}
…I’m so sorry. With such a lovely view of autumn before us, I couldn’t help but gaze silently in awe.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shu v2 %}
You’re taking multiple photos, so it’s no surprise that you were quiet. What sort of photos did you take?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tatsumi %}
Would you like to see for yourself? Here you go.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shu v2 %}
…Hm. All of them are photographs of the scenery. Do you like taking photos of this composition?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tatsumi %}
Yes, I always take photos like this during my travels. Whenever I have the urge to preserve a spectacle, I naturally end up with photos like this.

I see that for you, it’s… photographs focusing on something specific, such as a shop’s ornaments, autumn leaves, and the like — is that correct?

How interesting. We’re both looking at the same thing, but end up with vastly different photos.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shu v2 %}
That would be because I took these as reference photos for my future creations.

However… I should take photos of the scenery, as well. Your photographs reminded me of Kagehira.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tatsumi %}
Reminded you of Mika-san…?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shu yare %}
He sometimes sends me photographs whenever I’m living overseas, perhaps out of concern.

The photos tend to be of anything he’s doing, be it his circle activities, or an outing with a friend, and so on — all the while rambling about such topics.

It’s about time I also send something to him, at least every once in a while.

…However, while I know this isn’t something I should say as another tourist here…

I do wish this crowd could fade away somehow. They keep appearing in the photographs no matter what angle I take them in.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tatsumi %}
Hmm… If I remember clearly, our inn wasn’t that far away from here…

Shu-san, how about the two of us visit this area tomorrow in the early morning?

{% bubble Shu v2 %}
Early morning…?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tatsumi %}
You see, I spoke to my unit members the other day about my trip to Kyoto.

While we were all excited by the thought of visiting the place together someday, Mayoi-san can’t quite handle crowds very well…

He expressed that he’ll do his best to endure it, but we would never want to force him.

Thus, we decided that we would visit the famous tourist spots early in the morning, and after that, explore the more obscure, quiet areas of the city.

This region is filled with its own history, so there surely lies many unknown charms to it. And places with little to no people in it feels like a fun adventure of its own, don’t you think?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shu norsmile %}
I see. That isn’t such a bad idea, actually. Very well then, we’ll visit this area tomorrow morning.

I believe we’ll be able to relax and explore in peace, as long as the cameras aren’t on us.
{% endbubble %}

<div class="msr-narration">
    <p>Meanwhile, elsewhere…</p>
</div>

{% bubble Jun v3 %}
The autumn leaves are real pretty~
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki grin %}
Mhm! They really are pretty!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Jun awkward %}
Umm… Sorry, I’m terrible with words, so the only thing I have to say is how pretty it is…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki grin %}
Me too! It’s fine if we can’t think of anything else to say! The beauty of nature is experienced through the soul, after all! ☆
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Jun v3 %}
That’s true. Ahaha~
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Jun curious %}
Anyway, is it just me, or…

Are there four rowboats heading our way at full speed?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki curious %}
Mm? The guy standing in an imposing manner on the first boat seems familiar to me…

Is that… Otogari?
{% endbubble %}

## Chapter 5

{% bubble Akiomi %}
“—As you may have noticed, the guest idol of the first day is Otogari-kun from UNDEAD!”
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Adonis norsmile %}
Hello, I’m Otogari Adonis. My partner is—
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Makoto %}
Me! Let’s do our best together, Otogari-kun.

You really surprised me with that imposing stance, Otogari-kun. You’ve got a knack for grand appearances!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Adonis curious %}
I had intended to look like a dependable ally, but maybe it looked odd…?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Makoto %}
Not at all, you looked super cool. The whole place was in awe watching you.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Adonis norsmile %}
Really? I’m glad to hear that.

Oogami was meant to come here at first, but he had an urgent matter to deal with. That’s why I’ve come in his stead.

He told me to make a “piercing impression” on everyone for his sake as well, so I asked the staff members for their help.

It was a little embarrassing, but I’m happy to know that it made me stand out.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Akiomi %}
“Now that Otogari-kun has joined hands with his partner, we can begin the game segment—”

“But before that, would you like to think up a pair name, Yuuki-kun? Or will you stay as ‘Yuuki &amp; Otogari Pair’?”
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Makoto %}
I’d like to think of something for this special occasion. Hmm, let’s see here…

Let’s make it our favorite food. I personally love snacks, and Otogari-kun loves…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Adonis %}
Meat.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Makoto %}
Ahaha, I knew you’d say that~♪

Snacks, meat… meat, snacks…

Mm~… How about “Meat-snack Pair”?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Jun curious %}
Mm? The heck is that…?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Makoto %}
I just came up with it on the spot; it doesn’t really have a meaning. But doesn’t a meaty snack sound kind of tasty?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Adonis norsmile %}
Yes, it immediately made me think of barbecue-flavored chips. “Meat-snack Pair”… Mhm, I like it.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Makoto %}
I’m so glad~ Kunugi-sensei, please call us “Meat-snack Pair”! ♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Akiomi %}
“Understood. Right then, let’s carry on.”

“Today’s game will be… ‘Arashiyama Boat Quiz Rally’!”

“The participants will be divided into pairs and move along the river in rowboats, crossing by relay stations at the riverbank until they reach the goal.”
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Jin %}
“At each relay station, you must answer the quiz correctly to advance to the next station.”

“The quiz’s clue is hidden on the riverbank where the relay station is located. If you don’t know the answer, you can get off the boat and look for the clue.”

“You will earn four points, three points, two points, or one point depending on the order in which you reached the goal.”

“This is a game that tests both intelligence and physical strength. Even those who aren’t confident in their physical strength have a good chance to win. Break a leg out there~”
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Akiomi %}
“Now, may each pair choose their preferred rowboat. We will begin as soon as everyone is settled in their positions.”
{% endbubble %}

<div class="msr-narration">
    <p>After a while, during the middle stage of the Arashiyama Boat Quiz Rally…</p>
</div>

{% bubble Akiomi %}
“We’re nearing the final stage of the Arashiyama Boat Quiz Rally.”

“The Meat-snack Pair is taking the lead!”
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Makoto curious %}
Otogari-kun, you’re the only one rowing the boat… Are you okay? Are you sure you aren’t tired?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Adonis norsmile %}
I’m alright. Leave the rowing to me, while you focus on the quiz, Yuuki.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Jin %}
“It looks like Otogari’s physical strength and Yuuki’s intelligence are perfectly complementing each other.”

“Following closely behind is the Grapevine Pair!”
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Nagisa v2 %}
…I’ve figured out the trick to rowing efficiently. I think we’ll be able to catch up to them.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Yuzuru %}
Indeed. Let’s keep up this pace and advance onwards.

You did an excellent job with the previous stopover’s quiz. Even the staff were surprised that you managed such a difficult question.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Nagisa v2 %}
…I studied the history of Kyoto as much as I could before we came here.

…I put it into practice where I least expected it to. You never know when knowledge can be useful to you.

…But the opportunity to utilize it will come eventually.

…I got to learn a lot about Kyoto’s traditional culture, after all. I once again feel the importance of learning.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Akiomi %}
“We can see the Kazehaya &amp; Itsuki Pair behind the Grapevine Pair.”

“They seem to be enjoying their time on the boat as they complete the quiz rally.”
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tatsumi %}
Shu-san, please look over that side. There’s a deer.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shu norsmile %}
Hm? …Ah, you’re right. It’s walking around in such a carefree manner.

The view from the boat is spectacular, isn’t it? The colorful autumn leaves reflected on the river’s surface nearly resemble paintings on the water.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tatsumi %}
I agree. While the competition is important, it would be a shame to miss out on appreciating the scenery.

And by rowing slowly, we allow the viewers to enjoy the view with us. Let’s savor this enjoyable moment at our own pace.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Akiomi %}
“Their strategy is to enjoy sightseeing while being aware of the footage the show will air. How absolutely wonderful.”

“Even then, they are still in third place. It truly makes you wonder what on earth the Fiery☆Pair is doing right now…”
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Jin %}
“…No, seriously though, I can’t spot the Fiery☆Pair at all…? Cameraman, could you please show them on the screen?”

“Ohh! There they are.”

“Mm? Why’re they giving a kid a ride on their boat…?”
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Jun v3 %}
—Ah, I think I found someone that matches the description.

There’s two people waving their hands to us; I’m guessing those are the kid’s parents?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki %}
Looks like it! The little kid’s finally smiling! ☆

This is great news! You’ll get to be with your mom and dad soon!

Let’s wave our hands back to show that all is well! Heeey~♪ *<th>(waves hand)</th>*
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Jun v3 %}
Haha. You were really outta luck today, huh~ Getting so engrossed in picking up pebbles by the river that you ended up missing your chance to get on the ferry.

But getting lost in a tourist area is no joking matter, y’know~ Make sure to stay by your mom and dad’s sides from now on, ‘kay?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki %}
…You’d like to give us the pebbles you picked up?

Mhm, I like the smooth texture! Thank you, I’ll keep it safe with me!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Jun v3 %}
*<th>(whispering)</th>* We’re just ignoring the quiz rally, huh… We’re gonna be in last place at this rate, or worse, disqualified…

But I’d be fine with that. It’d have left a real bad taste in my mouth if we left this little kid all on their own.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki grin %}
Yeah! We still have another game segment tomorrow, and one quiz rally won’t be enough to decide the winner.

There’s no need to rush. Let’s just be proud of ourselves for protecting this kid’s smile…☆
{% endbubble %}

## Chapter 6

<div class="msr-narration">
    <p>A while later…</p>
</div>

{% bubble Akiomi %}
“Well done, everyone.”

“Now that the Arashiyama Boat Quiz Rally is over, we will send the guest idol Otogari-kun home, and then head towards the inn you will be staying at. However, before that—”

“We will host the surprise event: ‘Confession Under the Autumn Leaves’.”
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki curious %}
Confession Under the Autumn Leaves…? I don’t recall seeing that in the script…?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Jun v3 %}
I think that’s why it’s called a surprise event, since they didn’t tell us about it beforehand~
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Jin %}
“Yep, exactly. You’re quick to figure it out.”

“For the sake of our show’s sponsor, the bridal company, we’d like to squeeze a little sweet event in between~♪”

“The rules are simple: Each of you will take turns to stand in this filming spot, and make a confession of love towards the camera.”

“We’ll have a vote after the show is over, and the idol who wins first place will receive a grand prize from the show~♪”
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Akiomi %}
“To clarify, the ‘Confession Under the Autumn Leaves’ event is separate from the points you gained in the game segment. Everyone is a rival here, including your partner.”

“You only have thirty seconds. Please do ensure to seize the hearts of everyone watching through a short, love-filled confession.”
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Jin %}
“Alright then, whoever’s ready can go ahead and stand behind the camera~♪”
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shu v2 %}
Hm… I cannot simply come up with something on the spot.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tatsumi %}
It seems everyone needs a bit more time to think about theirs. Very well, if you’ll allow me, I will go first.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Jun surprised %}
You already thought something up, Tatsumi-senpai!? That’s incredible…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tatsumi %}
Fufu, looking at the autumn leaves sprung something to mind.

…It’s this camera, yes? All right, then.
{% endbubble %}

{% img /img/es/eventstory/weddingmarch/tatsumiorigcg.jpg %}

{% bubble Tatsumi %}
“…Every time you smile, my heart flutters like the autumn leaves before us.”

“I love you. May we continue to make wonderful memories together.”
{% endbubble %}

<div class="msr-location">
    <p><span><b>Location:</b> Inn’s Hot Spring</span></p>
</div>

{% img /img/es/eventstory/weddingmarch/red6_1.jpg %}

<div class="msr-narration">
    <p>Later that evening…</p>
</div>

{% bubble Jun v3 %}
Fhew~ Soaking in the open-air bath after dinner is real nice. The cool breeze feels good on the hot skin…♪

And the cameras aren’t on us anymore, so we can finally relax a li’l~
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tatsumi %}
Indeed we can. There will be more filming to do before we sleep, so we cannot stay here for too long… But for now, let’s soothe our bodies so that we may have a good night’s sleep.
{% endbubble %}

{% img /img/es/eventstory/weddingmarch/red6_2.jpg %}

{% bubble Nagisa curious %}
…Chiaki-kun, what have you been doing for the past minute?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki %}
Ah, Ran! I’m making water guns.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Nagisa v2 %}
…Water guns?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki %}
So first, you clasp your hands together, then make a gap with your thumbs, and then dip your hands in the water.

Then try squeezing out the water inside your palms—
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Nagisa v2 %}
…I see. I’ll give it a try.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki %}
Mm, you aren’t doing it with enough force… You have to slap your palms together like you would when clapping!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Nagisa v2 %}
…I managed it.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki %}
Alright, you’re doing great! Keep at it!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Nagisa v2 %}
…Fufu, I’d like to shoot it out farther.

…♪

…Ah—!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shu shocked %}
Guh—! Who just played a prank on me!?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Nagisa worried %}
…I hadn’t intended to do that to you. I’m sorry.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki awkward %}
It was me, Itsuki! I was making water guns, and accidentally shot it too far. I’m sorry.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shu frown %}
*Morisawa…* It’s disgraceful to act this way when there are people younger than you here. Show some self-control.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki %}
Mhm, thanks for the advice!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Nagisa serious %}
…But it was I who made the mistake. Why did you cover for me?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki %}
You didn’t do anything wrong, Ran. It was my fault for not informing you how to be more attentive of your surroundings when making water guns.

I feel bad that Itsuki had to go through that, but we learned a good lesson from it. Let’s enjoy making water guns without causing trouble for others~♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Nagisa v2 %}
…Alright, let’s.

…I think it will be too early to sleep once we’re done here. Is there something people do during a field trip before they go to bed? Or do they simply just go to sleep…?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tatsumi %}
Aira-san informed me that talking about your romantic crush and pillow fighting are a staple during field trips.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Nagisa curious %}
…Romantic crush…

…Jun, what is a “romantic crush”?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Jun surprised %}
Wha!? You’re asking *me!?*
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Nagisa serious %}
…In terms of words, I do know what “romantic” means, but what is “crush”?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Jun serious %}
It’s the person you’re in love with, basically.[^4] I dunno why it’s something you talk about on a field trip, though…

Isn’t that kinda out-of-bounds for us…? I mean, we don’t have any experience in it, and either way, we’re all idols.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Nagisa northinking %}
…That’s true. I don’t have as much experience with various people as Hiyori-kun does, for example.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Yuzuru %}
…Perhaps discussing romantic tales is out of the question, but we should be able to carry out a pillow fight.

We will have to ask the staff members and the inn management first, but it would surely make for an exciting watch for the viewers.
{% endbubble %}

{% img /img/es/eventstory/weddingmarch/red6_3.jpg %}

{% bubble Makoto %}
I like that idea! ♪ Let’s ask Anzu-chan as soon as we’re done soaking in the hot spring.

Just to make sure; do you know what pillow fights are, Nagisa-san?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Nagisa curious %}
…I assume by the name, you compete with pillows…? I don’t quite understand why you would do that, though.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tatsumi curious %}
Why, you ask…? Strangely enough, I never thought about it when I first heard of it.

But now that you mention it, I’m curious to know why, too.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki grin %}
People need no reason to play games, y’know! It’s simply just because the pillow is right there before them! ☆
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Jun awkward %}
Mm, that doesn’t really feel like a reason…?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki grin %}
Fuhaha! ☆ To be honest with you, I don’t have a clue why, either.

But don’t worry about it! There are plenty of things in the world that have no actual reason why they’re the way they are.

Let’s just enjoy the beauty of pillow fighting together!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shu frown %}
Hmph! I find it questionable how you simply try to power through your reasoning with mere fervor.
{% endbubble %}

{% img /img/es/eventstory/weddingmarch/red6_4.jpg %}

{% bubble Tatsumi %}
Fufu, but Nagisa-san seems satisfied with it, so all is well, no?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shu frown %}
Perhaps… In the end, it is nothing but a game for children. But I suppose it’s fine for those who are interested to do as they like.

…Wait, hold on a moment — you don’t mean to say that <em>I</em> will also be participating…!?
{% endbubble %}

## Chapter 7

<div class="msr-location">
    <p><span><b>Location:</b> Inn’s Room</span></p>
</div>

{% img /img/es/eventstory/weddingmarch/red7_1.jpg %}

<div class="msr-narration">
    <p>An hour or so later…</p>
</div>

{% bubble Akiomi %}
“We’re sorry to have kept you all waiting. It is almost time to show the results of the first day. But before that—”

“We will be having a mini segment: the pillow-fighting competition!”

“The rules are as follows: Typically you have a pillow fight with two teams, but we will have four teams fighting each other at the same time.”

“Each pair has their own territory, and once the game begins, they will have five pillows within their territory.”

“Each round will last two minutes. You can either throw pillows into your opponent’s territory, or you can interfere with them by throwing pillows directly at them.”

“After a round is over, the pair with the least amount of pillows in their territory will receive one point. After four rounds, those points will be added up to the pair’s score.”

“Furthermore, every pair can utilize one futon during the game.”

“Yuuki-kun is the one who thought up the rules of the game. The rules allow for some complex strategies, so please do enjoy yourselves.”
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki %}
Ohh! I was just thinking about how incredibly elaborate the rules were — So Yuuki came up with them, huh?
{% endbubble %}

{% img /img/es/eventstory/weddingmarch/red7_2.jpg %}

{% bubble Makoto %}
Yep! I know nobody asked me to, but I thought it’d make things more fun…♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Akiomi %}
“There will be thirty seconds to rest between each round. Do be sure to utilize that time for coming up with new strategies.”
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Jin %}
“Oh, and now that Otogari’s gone back home, I’m gonna pair up with Yuuki.”
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Jin sigh2 %}
“<em><th>(whispering)</th></em> …Unfortunately.”
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Akiomi glare %}
“No complaining. I will be taking care of the lengthy explanations, so please help around for this, at least.”

“Right then, please relocate yourselves to your designated territory!”
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Jun v3 %}
I’m glad the rules are easy to understand~ Plus, these types of matches are made for me.

I’m itching to put my skills to use~ Let’s make sure we win, Morisawa-senpai!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki %}
Mhm! Let’s observe our surroundings while ensuring all pillows are out of our territory!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Akiomi %}
“Is each pair ready to start?”

“Right then, the first round begins… now!”
{% endbubble %}

{% img /img/es/eventstory/weddingmarch/red7_3.jpg %}

{% bubble Yuzuru %}
Ran-sama. As per our strategy, you may entrust the frontline defense to me.

Please stay in the back and analyze each pair’s movements.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Nagisa v2 %}
…Okay. I’ll leave it to you, then. Good luck.

…May I use my “call” right now? The rules say that you can’t make one after the results are announced.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Yuzuru %}
Yes, feel free to do so.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Nagisa v2 %}
…Thank you.
{% endbubble %}

<div class="msr-narration">
    <p>Phone ringing</p>
</div>

{% bubble Nagisa v2 %}
…Hello, Hiyori-kun?

…Ah, so you’re aware of the show’s designated “call”. Yes, I’m abiding by the rules.

…No, I don’t have anything I’d like to ask in particular. However—

…I simply wished to let you know that I’m enjoying myself right now.

…Alright, I’ll see you another time.

…Good night. I hope you have a sweet dream, too.

…Yuzuru-kun, I’m sorry to keep you waiting.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Yuzuru %}
Um… Ran-sama? If I’m not mistaken, you made a phone call about something completely unrelated to the game…?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Nagisa v2 %}
…I did. I wanted to try using my call for the day, as well as say good night to Hiyori-kun.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Yuzuru awkward %}
I-I see… I would appreciate it if you could at least save that sort of thing for later.

While I’m aware that I was the one who chose to be the frontline defense, we *are* still in the middle of a match.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Nagisa v2 %}
…From what I can tell, you haven’t been struggling at all, Yuzuru-kun.

…Even now, you’re evading every pillow coming your way. I feel like we could win even if I were to go to sleep.

…But it isn’t every day that we are on the same team, so it would just be sad to sleep through the game.

…It’s impressive that you were able to hold your ground on your own. I will now start going on the offense.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Yuzuru curious %}
Eh? But we have yet to analyze their attacks…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Nagisa v2 %}
…Don’t worry. I observed each pair’s movements while I was on the phone. I’ve fully analyzed the situation.

…It’s time to strike back.
{% endbubble %}

{% img /img/es/eventstory/weddingmarch/red7_4.jpg %}

<div class="msr-narration">
    <p>Before Round Two…</p>
</div>

{% bubble Shu frown %}
…What a hyperactive game — I ended up retaliating in return. Fortunately, we managed to win the first round…

Although, I don’t know if I was simply imagining things, but the Grapevine Pair suddenly gained momentum right at the last second…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tatsumi %}
Indeed they did. We managed to evade their attacks in time, but it was a very close call.

……………

…Shu-san, how about we go with this strategy?
{% endbubble %}

<div class="msr-narration">
    <p>Before Round Three…</p>
</div>

{% bubble Makoto curious %}
The Kazehaya &amp; Itsuki Pair are making really good use of the futon…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Jin sigh2 %}
Yeah… Our pillows keep bouncing off and losing momentum.

Man, isn’t the futon just cheating? Of <em>course</em> we’ll barely put up a fight if they stretch the thing out in front of them.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Makoto awkward %}
I came up with the rules on the spot, so I guess it was bound to have a loophole to it…

But I’m sure we can come up with a counterattack…! Let’s try and figure it out while fighting.
{% endbubble %}

<div class="msr-narration">
    <p>Before the last round…</p>
</div>

{% bubble Nagisa v2 %}
…It seems that the Kazehaya &amp; Itsuki Pair lit a fire in Makoto-kun’s team. They’ve changed strategies.

One team is akin to military commanders, and the other to intellectual generals. How interesting; it’s as if their personalities have taken form.

…How shall we approach the final round?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Yuzuru %}
Hmm… How about we fight as we like?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Nagisa v2 %}
…As we like…?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Yuzuru %}
You see, my first experience having a pillow fight was on my school trip last year. It was the very first time I had allowed myself to <em>enjoy</em> myself, laughing endlessly… It truly was fun.[^5]

I could not forget how much fun it was even once I had laid down on my futon to rest — to the point that I had overslept the following day.

That is why I wish for the both of us to simply enjoy ourselves for the last round. Let us follow what our hearts say.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Nagisa v2 %}
…Then I’ll follow my heart, and aim for victory.

…It’s Ibara’s influence on me, you see. I quite enjoy battle fighting…♪
{% endbubble %}

<div class="msr-narration">
    <p>After the last round…</p>
</div>

{% bubble Chiaki %}
Whew, it’s over… Great job, Sazanami!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Jun awkward %}
…Yeah, you too, Morisawa-senpai.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki %}
Mm? You’re laying down — Did it tire you out?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Jun v3 %}
Nah, I just wanna take in the moment for a bit.
{% endbubble %}

{% img /img/es/eventstory/weddingmarch/junorigcg.jpg %}

{% bubble Jun v3 %}
…I’ve never, ever had a pillow fight before in my whole life.

I’ve seen it in manga before, so I did know about it, but…

I had no idea it was <em>this</em> much fun. Haha, I had a real blast…♪
{% endbubble %}

## Chapter 8

{% bubble Akiomi %}
“—The pillow-fighting competition is over.”

“It’s finally time to announce what everyone has been waiting for — the results of the first day! After calculating the points thus far—”

“The team in first place is the Grapevine Pair, with five points. Congratulations!”
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Jin awkward %}
“Second place goes to Yuuki, with four points. Sorry, I think your old man here might’ve held you back…”
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Akiomi %}
“In third place is the Kazehaya &amp; Itsuki Pair, with three points, and in fourth place is the Fiery☆Pair, with two.”

“Your points will carry over to the next day, and tomorrow you will be paired with someone new. You will still have many opportunities to turn the tides to your favor, so don’t give up just yet.”

“I hope our dear viewers enjoyed the first day of the event. Please look forward to finding out what awaits our idols tomorrow.”
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Jin %}
“We’ll stop filming here for today. We’re gonna leave you guys to your own devices now, but be sure to sleep early tonight, ‘kay?”

“Alright then, g’night~”
{% endbubble %}

{% img /img/es/eventstory/weddingmarch/red8_1.jpg %}

<div class="msr-narration">
    <p>After the filming…</p>
</div>

{% bubble Jun curious %}
…………

…Nagi-senpai, do you feel like you can sleep?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Nagisa serious %}
…Why do you ask?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Jun serious %}
‘Cause I thought you might not be used to sleeping ‘round a bunch of people like I am.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Nagisa serious %}
…I’m alright, but I may stay up for a bit longer.

…I feel wide-awake after moving around so much.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tatsumi %}
While we may have turned off the lights, it does feel a little too early to sleep. How about we chat amongst each other from our futons?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Nagisa v2 %}
…Then, how about we talk about our “romantic crush”?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Jun awkward %}
Ehh…? Just how badly do you wanna talk about crushes…?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Nagisa v2 %}
…We were able to have a pillow fight. So I was wondering if it’s possible we could experience the other staple of field trips.

…There are no cameras on us anymore, so we don’t have to restrain ourselves anymore, correct?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Jun frown %}
Well, the real problem is the actual topic itself… I don’t have any experience with that sorta thing, so I don’t really have anything to share.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki grin %}
Alright then, let’s switch it to a different topic! Let’s talk about the hero we admire the most! ☆
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shu frown %}
…Morisawa, do <em>not</em> force yourself into their conversation. Learn to read the room.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tatsumi %}
Fufu, I don’t mind at all. By the way, which hero do you admire the most, Shu-san?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shu v2 %}
Hm… Assuming it’s fine to interpret that as the “person I admire,” I very much admire the notable artists, such as Leonardo da Vinci.

Just like those prestigious creators, I, too, wish to create art that will continue to be cherished even after my death.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki grin %}
I know for sure that <em>you</em> can achieve that, Itsuki!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shu frown %}
Your words truly hold no weight… How about you, Kazehaya?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tatsumi %}
Me? Well, I suppose it’s a little different from admiration, but I would say “God”.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Nagisa curious %}
…Me?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tatsumi curious %}
……?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Nagisa v2 %}
…Fufufu. It’s a “God” joke. ♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Jun awkward %}
Nagi-senpai, that sorta joke is too advanced for people to get, so I’d say it’s best to keep it between us unit members~♪

<th>(I can’t really see well in the dark, but… I bet Tatsumi-senpai was really taken aback by that… I think it’s best if I just switch topics somehow…)</th>

Yuuki-saaan~ You awake?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Makoto %}
Ah, yeah, I am. I didn’t know if it was okay for me to join in, so I was just listening to everyone.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Jun v3 %}
Aight, so I’ll just get right to it — Who do you admire?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Makoto %}
Hmm… I’d say pro gamers~

Becoming a pro gamer isn’t something you can become just because you want to. Only a handful of people with natural flair and enough hard work can pass through the narrow gate of success…

They make a living just through their skills, and pave their path all on their own. I think it’s amazing… What about you, Fushimi-kun?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Yuzuru northinking %}
Me? Hmm…

Just like Kazehaya-sama, I would say it is a little different from admiration… However, my parents are my role models.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Nagisa v2 %}
…Ah, parents.

…I, too, admire my father.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tatsumi %}
The two of you are very fond of your family, I see. What about you, Jun-san?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Jun v3 %}
Me…? Well, my parents are outta the question…

I’d say Tatsumi-senpai… Ohii-san… Nagi-senpai, too… Mmm~…

I can’t choose just one person, so is it alright if I just say “idols”?

Aight, we’re down to the last person~! We’d love to hear your answer, Morisawa-senpai.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki snicker %}
*He he he…* The hero I admire…

Fwoosh—! Are the *heroes!* ☆
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Yuzuru curious %}
…?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tatsumi northinking %}
…?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Makoto curious %}
The hero you admire… are the heroes…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Nagisa curious %}
…A “hero” joke, perhaps?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shu frown %}
It’s the usual nonsense from him. Morisawa simplifies his expressions far too much.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki grin %}
It’d take a long time to explain myself, that’s why! There are more than four hundred tokusatsu heroes, y’know! It’s impossible to narrow it down to only one.

Alright, you know what — I’ll tell you all about the history of heroes, as a bedtime story! ☆
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tatsumi %}
Fufu, I may end up dreaming about heroes, then.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shu frown %}
Good grief… I can only hope I won’t have a nightmare.
{% endbubble %}

## Chapter 9

<div class="msr-location">
    <p><span><b>Location:</b> Kiyomizu Temple</span></p>
</div>

{% img /img/es/eventstory/weddingmarch/red9_1.jpg %}

<div class="msr-narration">
    <p>Next day, in the morning…</p>
</div>

{% bubble Jun curious %}
Ooh, this is the famous waterfall, huh… Mm, it’s sorta, like…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki idle %}
It doesn’t really look like a waterfall, does it?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Jun v3 %}
Yeah, that’s exactly it. And we saw a huge one just yesterday, so I can’t help but think that…

There are three streams, and each one has a different benefit, yeah?

Starting from the right, it’s longevity, then a fortunate love life, and then success in studies… Obviously, I’d go with—
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble JunChiaki %}
Longevity!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Jun v3 %}
Yep, thought you’d agree~ After all, for us idols, our body is our livelihood.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki smile3 %}
The very idea of living a long life is nice, as well. I’d like to remain as an idol that is loved by others forever.

Alright, it’s about time to start filming. Let’s head back to the others once we drink from the waterfall.[^6]
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Jun v3 %}
Gotcha~♪
{% endbubble %}

<div class="msr-narration">
    <p>Ten minutes later, in the Kiyomizu Temple premises…</p>
</div>

{% bubble Akiomi %}
“—Good morning, your host Kunugi is speaking. We have reserved the Kiyomizu Temple for the second day’s filming.”

“Unlike the first day, we will begin with the game segment. Right then, it’s time to draw the lottery for your pairs.”
{% endbubble %}

<div class="msr-narration">
    <p>A few minutes later…</p>
</div>

{% bubble Jin %}
“—Alright. I see everyone’s introduced themselves to their partner and thought up a pair name, so we’ll announce our teams of the day.”

“First we have the ‘Wind Pair,’ Ran and Kazehaya.”
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tatsumi %}
We came up with the name when we realized we share something in common between our names.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Nagisa v2 %}
…“Kazehaya” means “swift wind,” and “Nagi” means “calm wind”. I don’t know what wind we will discover with the two combined, but…

…I hope our experience will be as fun as yesterday.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Jin %}
“Next up is the ‘Classmates Pair,’ Yuuki and Fushimi.”
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Makoto %}
Good morning. I was paired with the guest idol yesterday, but…

For today, I’m partnered with Fushimi-kun. We’re actually in the same class in school!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Yuzuru %}
Fufu. Yuuki-sama and I were also on the same school trip last year.

I will do my best to make use of that experience in order to achieve victory…♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Akiomi %}
“Next… We have Morisawa-kun and Sazanami-kun, who coincidentally ended up being a pair again: ‘True☆Fiery☆Pair’.”
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki grin %}
Good moooorniiiing! I’m Morisawa Chiaki!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Jun v3 %}
Ooh, you’ve got loadsa energy… Good morning, I’m Sazanami Jun.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki grin %}
The two of us are completely different people today! For we have been reborn as the “True☆Fiery☆Pair”!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Jun v3 %}
We’re gonna do our best to get first place, so please cheer for us~
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shu v2 %}
…Which means the guest idol shall be partnering with me.

I do hope that it’s someone who suits me and my love for the arts, however…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Jin %}
“Yeah, you’ll be fine. Probably. I dunno.”

“Alright then, let’s call him over. Today’s guest idol is…”
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Izumi v2 %}
Yuuu\~kuuun\~! Your Onii-chan is here to see you\~♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Makoto surprised %}
Whoa— Izumi-san!?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Izumi v2 %}
Let’s hold hands and work hard side-by-side, together! ♪

I’d do anything for you, Yuu-kun — Even if it’s jumping out of the Kiyomizu premises over and over again~!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Makoto worried %}
No, no, that’s dangerous… And I’m not your partner, anyway.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Izumi curious %}
…Huh?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shu v2 %}
Your partner would be me, Sena.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Izumi glare %}
Hah… Ex<em>cuse</em> me!? It was written in the project plan that I’d get paired with Yuu-kun if I were to join, so what gives!?

I came <em>all</em> the way here from Florence <em>specifically</em> for those few hours I could have with Yuu-kun, y’know!?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Jin %}
“We appreciate you coming over, but I’m pretty sure it only said you <em>could</em> get paired with him, not that you <em>will</em>.”
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Izumi glare %}
Who cares about the details!?

Why am I paired with *“Shu”* and not <em>“Yuu”</em>-kun!? Sure, the names may <em>sound</em> similar, but Itsuki and Yuu-kun are like night and day, okay!?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shu frown %}
…Is there a receipt? I’d like to make a return on the guest idol.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Akiomi %}
“You are not allowed to do that. Please bear with it.”
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shu yare %}
<em>Sigh</em>… Unfortunately, it looks like first place will be out of reach for me.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Izumi glare %}
Excuse me? Why’re you giving up already? I mean, <em>yeah</em>, it’s unfortunate that I didn’t get to be paired with Yuu-kun, but—

I’d <em>never</em> risk performing below par. I’m going to take this match seriously. That’s why—
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Izumi v2 %}
Make sure to watch me closely, Yu\~u\~kun…♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Makoto awkward %}
Ahaha… Sensei, please carry on with the explanation~
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Akiomi %}
“All right then. For the second day, you will take on the ‘Ema Hunt Challenge’.”

“I’ll explain the rules. In this game, you will try to find picture plaques of <em>ema</em>[^7] hidden within Kiyomizu Temple.”

“You will first start by drawing a fortune slip. Please find the <em>ema</em> by relying on the clue written on your slip.”

“Since this is a fortune-based lottery, the difficulty of the clue will vary depending on your fortune. You cannot redraw your slip, so choose carefully.”

“Points will be awarded to the pair who finds the most plaques of ema within the time limit. Please try to find as many <em>ema</em> as possible.”

“Right then, the Ema Hunt Challenge begins… now!”
{% endbubble %}

<div class="msr-narration">
    <p>A while later…</p>
</div>

{% bubble Tatsumi %}
We’ve found four plaques of <em>ema</em>. Fufu, we’re doing extremely well.

Time to draw a new fortune slip… All right, let me read it. Our fortune is the middle blessing. Our clue is—

“Hide and seek on the rabbits back”. Rabbit… I do feel like I saw one earlier…?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Nagisa v2 %}
…That would be the Jishu-Jinja Shrine.[^8] There was a rabbit statue there.

…I remember it because it was unusually standing on only two feet. Let’s go there.
{% endbubble %}

## Chapter 10

<div class="msr-location">
    <p><span><b>Location:</b> Kyoto City Shopping District</span></p>
</div>

{% img /img/es/eventstory/weddingmarch/red10_1.jpg %}

<div class="msr-narration">
    <p>At noon, during the sightseeing segment: Kyoto City shopping district…</p>
</div>

{% bubble Jun sigh %}
…I really was trying my hardest, but I still ended up losing…

Both Morisawa-senpai and I are in last place, and that means both of us are gonna be forced into doing tomorrow’s “final redemption to turn the tables” event…

Which basically means a punishment game for us, doesn’t it…? *Sigh,* just the thought of it bums me out…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki grin %}
Don’t worry! I have a strategy I’ve been saving for the end. I’ll do something about all of this, so keep your chin up and smile!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Jun curious %}
Mm? Strategy?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki %}
Yeah, you can look forward to seeing it tomorrow! Come on now, let’s join the others and enjoy the place! ☆
{% endbubble %}

{% img /img/es/eventstory/weddingmarch/nagisaorigcg.jpg %}

{% bubble Nagisa v2 %}
…Hello, Ibara? Are you in the middle of work?

…I’d like to ask you something. What sort of souvenir would you wish for me to get you?

…I don’t want a generic answer. I’d like to know what you personally want me to buy.

…It’s a gift, after all. I’d love to get you something that would make you happy.

…Okay, I’ll go with that. Good luck at work, okay?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tatsumi %}
What did Ibara-san ask for in the end?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Nagisa v2 %}
…He said he’d like something that you can only buy in Kyoto. I believe he simply chose an answer that would satisfy me, but…

…I’m happy that he took the time to think about it.

…Thank you for letting me use my call.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tatsumi %}
My pleasure. I hope you can find a suitable souvenir.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Nagisa northinking %}
…Me too. Something you can only buy here… Maybe a handicraft?

…Ah, they have fox masks here.

…There we go. ♪ What do you think? Does it remind you of Kyoto?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tatsumi %}
It really suits you. They appear to be hand-painted.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Nagisa v2 %}
…So it’s a one-of-a-kind. It’s also light and easy to carry… I think I’ll go with this.

…I’ll buy one not only for Ibara, but for all of us in the unit. I’d like to give one to Hiyori-kun and Jun, as well.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Makoto %}
Oh, a fox mask! You look so cool~♪

The foxes reminded me of the thousand <em>torii</em> gates, a famous shrine in Kyoto.[^9] And since you’ve got such a mystical feel to you, Nagisa-san, I feel like you’d fit right in with the view of the shrine.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shu norsmile %}
Hm… I’m sure the <em>torii</em> gates are especially beautiful in autumn. If only we had a little more time, then maybe we could have visited them as well.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Yuzuru %}
Hmm… I believe visiting hours are open twenty-four-seven, so how about we visit it at night?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shu v2 %}
At night…? Not in the morning?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Yuzuru %}
Yes. I don’t think we will have a pillow fight tonight, and it is a little far from our inn. The best time to visit would be at night, when we have the most time to spare.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Jun v3 %}
Sounds fun~ It’s a famous shrine and all, so we’d love to join you guys, too.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki srsthinking %}
Mm, visiting a shrine at night…?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Jun serious %}
Mm? Morisawa-senpai, are you bad with scary stuff…?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki awkward %}
N-No, not at all. The only things I’m bad with are eggplants and ghosts!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shu yare %}
Then you wouldn’t be alright with this either, would you?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki frustrated %}
H-Hrmphh…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tatsumi %}
I would rather you not force yourself… However, there is no need to be afraid. There is a gate that wards off any evil spirits from the shrine.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki %}
M-Mm, I see. That’s a relief to hear, then. Plus, I wouldn’t be visiting alone, anyway.

It isn’t scary if we all go together! Fuhahahaha…! ☆
