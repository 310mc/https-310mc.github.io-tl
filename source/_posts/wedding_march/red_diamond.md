<div class="msr-narration">
    <p>Time passes until November. In the morning…</p>
</div>

{% bubble Jun v3 %}
…Ah, Morisawa-senpai. The staff gave me an update~

They’re still doing the final check-up around the place, but we’ll start filming as soon as they’re done.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki %}
Thank you! Sorry that I made you go all the way to ask them, Sazanami.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Jun v3 %}
It’s all good\~ I’m used to running errands for other people ‘cause of Ohii-san. Besides, I was the one who offered to do it, anyway\~♪

Now that that’s settled… The Golden Pavilion’s real neat, huh~?

I’m not smart enough to pick the right words here, but… I guess this is what you’d call “elegant”~?

And we get to enjoy the scenery all for ourselves right as it opens, so it feels all even more special~
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki %}
Mhm! So much has happened just to get here, but I’m so glad to know we were able to make it to this day. It’s truly touching…! ☆
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Jun v3 %}
Ahaha, it’s too early to celebrate\~ We haven’t even filmed our introductions yet, y’know\~? I get what you mean, though.

It took a real long time to get to this point, didn’t it~ Tenshouin-senpai himself was pretty shocked like, “I didn’t expect you to suggest a *variety show* of all things”.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki %}
Haha, he was even surprised that we managed to find four other idols to accompany us. I was worried at first over how our schedules would align, but…

Thanks to the P-Association’s assistance, we were able to ensure that both the filming and its public release will happen in autumn.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Jun v3 %}
I was surprised to hear “P-Association” pop up in the conversation, but I’m real glad they’re helping us out with this project.

Without Anzu-san’s comments, we would’ve never noticed that our project was turning out to just be a regular ol’ travel program.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki %}
Mhm! We kept having meetings together until we finally came up with a project that would satisfy everyone involved—

So I’m sure it’ll be a success! Rather, we’ll absolutely make certain that it becomes a success!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Yuzuru %}
…Ah, that’s where the two of you are.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki %}
Oh, Fushimi! Where’s everyone else?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Yuzuru %}
They are still having their make-up done. I believe they will be finished soon.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki %}
Ah, alright! We’re already such a large group, so I didn’t expect to have you onboard too, Fushimi! It feels reassuring! ☆
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Yuzuru %}
Yes, I’m here under Eichi-sama’s orders to act as an emergency contact.

While I do plan to participate in the filming, I will be taking a step back from everyone, so please pay no mind to me.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki %}
No, don’t be that way — we’re all equals here!

You’re part of the team, so you’re free to take as many steps forward as you like!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Yuzuru %}
Hm… The six of you are the ones who will be in the spotlight this time, so I would rather not stand out…

However, it is true that I may unintentionally worry our fans if they were to see me separated from everyone.

Therefore, I will be sure to display myself in moderation.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki %}
That’s the spirit! I expect great things from you, Fushimi!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shu frown %}
…You truly are noisy, Morisawa. Have you considered staying quiet for once, at least before our work begins?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tatsumi %}
I’m sorry to have kept you all waiting, everyone. The staff members seem to have finished the preparations, so it’s time to begin the briefing.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki %}
It’s finally time…! I don’t intend on pushing Ryuseitai’s way of doing things onto you all, but—

*All for one, one for all!* Let’s join hands and make this project a success! ☆
{% endbubble %}

## Chapter 2

{% img /img/es/eventstory/weddingmarch/red2_1.jpg %}

{% bubble Jin sigh2 %}
*Sigh…* Why do I gotta babysit when I’m in <em>Kyoto</em>…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Akiomi %}
We are here specifically to do that “babysitting”. Just to let you know, it’s completely alright to go home if you’d rather not do it. I can be the host on my own.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Jin frown %}
No way, with <em>this</em> many people? There’s no way you can manage it all on your own, Akiyan. Don’t ya agree, Anzu?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Akiomi frown %}
Please don’t coerce Anzu-san into agreeing with you. And I suggest that you avoid spoiling Jin, Anzu-san.

…I can see the group now. Once they’re done with the briefing, it’s time to begin filming.

Anzu-san, we’re entrusting you with all the behind-the-scenes arrangements.
{% endbubble %}

<div class="msr-narration">
    <p>Ten minutes later — They begin recording the online stream…</p>
</div>

{% bubble Jin %}
“Ermm, so, to everyone watching this stream… Heya, I’m Sagami Jin.”
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Akiomi %}
“Hello, I’m Kunugi Akiomi. We will be your hosts for this show. It’s a pleasure to work with all of you.”

“Now then, I believe there was already an explanation at the studio, but this show is not simply just about a short trip.”

“The first half of the first day will be the ‘sightseeing segment,’ where we will show the audience what you’re doing at the tourist attractions. The second half of the day will feature the ‘game segment,’ involving competitions.”

“For the game segment, you will compete in pairs.”

“The pairs will be decided based on a lottery, so we will have different pairs for each day.”

“Furthermore, you are allowed to make a ‘call’ once a day, to ask an acquaintance for help.”

“The only rule is that it must be an ES idol. Otherwise, you’re free to speak to them about anything. Please make use of it whenever you need it.”

“The idol with the most points by the end will receive a reward.”

“The prize is domestic travel tickets for your whole unit. Please do your utmost best in the show.”
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble MakotoChiaki %}
Yaay!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble JunTatsumi %}
Yaay~
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble YuzuruNagisa %}
…Yaay. ♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shu norsmile %}
…♪ <em><th>(smiles while nodding)</th></em>
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki idle %}
Mm? I didn’t hear you say “yay,” Itsuki! It’s part of the script to say it, y’know?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shu frown %}
Hmph! It isn’t in my character to do that.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki angry %}
*Hrmph…*
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shu v2 %}
What are you making that face for? I’m not your parent, and I’ve no interest in taking part in this foolish charade.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Jin %}
“Haha, looks like we can skip past loosening your nerves, huh? Okay then, it’s time to decide on your pairs.”
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki grin %}
*<th>(raises hand)</th>* Sagami-sensei, sir! We can’t make pairs out of seven people!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Jin %}
“Ahaha, great job on showing how to properly make a comment. It’s as Morisawa said — One person’s gonna be left without a partner.”

“That’s why we’ll have a guest idol show up only for the game segment. I hope you’re all excited to see who it is.”

“Right then, time to draw the lottery~”
{% endbubble %}

<div class="msr-narration">
    <p>A few minutes later…</p>
</div>

{% bubble Makoto %}
Mine is blank… Ah, that means I’ll be paired with the guest idol, huh.

Hmm, I wonder who it’ll be…? I hope it’s someone I’m on good terms with.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tatsumi %}
…My partner appears to be Shu-san.

I’ve heard a great deal about you. Natsume-san sometimes mentions you during our Gardenia activities.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shu v2 %}
From that boy…? How on earth did I end up being mentioned…? He wasn’t telling any untruths, was he?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tatsumi %}
I haven’t spoken to you much before, so I wouldn’t be able to confirm what is and isn’t factual, but…

I’m given the impression that you are someone special to him. He always looks so happy when talking about you.

I would love to take this opportunity to get to know you more. Let’s do our best together, Shu-san.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Yuzuru %}
I see that I’m partnered with Ran-sama. It is a pleasure to make your acquaintance.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Nagisa v2 %}
…Mhm. The pleasure is all mine.

…This is my first time on a field trip, so I’m really excited.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Jun v3 %}
<th>(Mm~… Nagi-senpai’s partner is Fushimi-san, huh…)</th>

<th>(I’ve got no clue why, but I do know Ibara has some hostility with him, so… I dunno what to expect once he finds out…)</th>

<th>(Oh well. I can’t be assed to think about it right now, and them’s the rules, so nothing I can do about it anyway…)</th>

We were a pair for the PV, and a pair again here, huh\~ I’m glad to work with you, Morisawa-senpai\~♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki %}
Mhm! While we may be rivals competing for points, we’re on the same team today!

Let’s join forces and get those points! ☆
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Akiomi %}
“Yuuki-kun is still awaiting his ‘guest idol’ partner, but I can see that the ‘Morisawa &amp; Sazanami Pair,’ ‘Kazehaya &amp; Itsuki Pair,’ and ‘Ran &amp; Fushimi Pair’ have all finished greeting each other. Very well then—”
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki %}
Hold it right there!

Calling us by our family names is too cheap. We need to come up with a pair name to strengthen our solidarity!

What would you like our name to be, Sazanami?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Jun v3 %}
Hmm, I’m fine with anything. Feel free to choose whatever you like, Senpai.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki %}
Hmm…

Okay then! We’re going to be the “Effort! Friendship! Victory! Fiery☆Hero Pair”! ☆
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Jin yare %}
“Hold on, that’s <em>way</em> too long… Can’t you make it something that won’t be exhausting to say?”
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki smile3 %}
*Hrmph…* Alright, then I’ll make it “Fiery☆Pair”!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tatsumi %}
What shall we make ours, Shu-san?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shu v2 %}
I’d prefer to keep it as “Kazehaya &amp; Itsuki Pair”. It’s only for today, anyway.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tatsumi %}
Understood. Then we will stay as is.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Yuzuru %}
Ran-sama, what shall we choose?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Nagisa v2 %}
…I’d like “Grapevine Pair”. It’s the fruit of the season, and grapes have a dreamy quality to them.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Yuzuru %}
Dreamy quality…?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Nagisa v2 %}
…Kaoru-kun told me about it.[^1] I didn’t fully understand, but…

…He said “life is more fun when you believe in those dreams”.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Yuzuru %}
Ohh… I don’t quite understand either, but you’d like us to be “Grapevine Pair,” yes? Very well then.

What shall you choose, Yuuki-sama?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Makoto %}
Hmm… I’m going to decide on a pair name after I meet up with my partner.

I wouldn’t want to choose something that doesn’t suit our image, after all.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Akiomi %}
“It appears everyone has chosen a pair name for themselves. Right then—”

“It’s time to begin the sightseeing segment at the Golden Pavilion.”
{% endbubble %}

## Chapter 3

<div class="msr-narration">
    <p>A while later…</p>
</div>

{% bubble Shu norsmile %}
…The Golden Pavilion is blinding, so I typically prefer the Silver Pavilion, but…

The actual sight of it is beautiful. Footage alone is truly incapable of capturing the scent and atmosphere of the place.

This experience alone makes visiting here worthwhile.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tatsumi curious %}
……………
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shu v2 %}
…Why are you inclining your head?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tatsumi %}
Well, I started to wonder — Why does the first floor of the Golden Pavilion not have a gold-leaf coating?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shu v2 %}
There are various theories, but it’s said that the Golden Pavilion was built with the purpose of showing off those in positions of authority at the time.

The evidence for this is the phoenix on the roof — which is said to present itself when the emperor appears — and the architectural style that you pointed out.

It is also said that each floor is divided into distinct styles to show the power hierarchy. The phoenix and the third floor are for the most powerful people; the second floor is for the samurai…

And the lowest floor — the first floor — is for the aristocrats. The lack of the  gold-leaf coating on the lowest floor is an indication of the first two storeys superiority over the nobles.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tatsumi %}
You’re very knowledgeable about it, aren’t you? Are you fond of this kind of architecture?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shu yare %}
It’s simply part of my study. The fine arts are a combination of many components.

However, I am no expert, and what I explained is only one of the common theories. If you wish to learn more, do your own research.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tatsumi %}
You’re right, that I will do. Thank you very much for explaining it to me, Shu-san.

…Oh? Chiaki-san and Jun-san are here.

What are you two doing?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Jun v3 %}
Ah, Tatsumi-senpai. We were just chatting while looking at the koi carps in the pond.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tatsumi %}
Chatting?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki %}
Yep! I was talking about how last year, Ryuseitai performed a live show to find a caretaker for a carp.[^2]
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tatsumi curious %}
You performed a live show rather than making a poster to search for a new owner…?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Jun v3 %}
Ahaha, even Tatsumi-senpai thought the same, huh\~ That’s what I said, too\~♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki %}
My juniors in Ryuseitai thought up the idea after a lot of brainstorming. With a live show, they’d be able to spread the news to a lot of people faster.

They were hoping they could save the carp after having been abandoned without a home.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shu v2 %}
…Well? Were you able to find someone to take custody of it?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki %}
Yeah. Apparently, there’s a pond in the temple of Hasumi’s home. That’s where they got to keep it safe.

Of course, if they had simply talked to Hasumi about it, they wouldn’t have needed to hold a live show, but… seeing the kids’ hard work rewarded with my own two eyes meant a lot to me.

So I consider it a really special memory.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tatsumi %}
Fufu, thank you for sharing such a beautiful story.

Speaking of carps… A local told me about this earlier, but there apparently is a waterfall with a stone that looks like a carp. What do you say we go a little further to see it?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki %}
That sounds intriguing! Let’s go check it out!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Jin %}
“It looks like the Fiery☆Pair and Kazehaya &amp; Itsuki Pair are going to the waterfall.”
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Akiomi %}
“The Grapevine Pair and Yuuki-kun… appear to be strolling a little far from the Golden Pavilion.”
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Nagisa curious %}
…? Such a charming design for this entrance’s curtains. What sort of establishment is this?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Makoto %}
Erm… It looks like it’s a place to experience tea etiquette.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Nagisa v2 %}
…Tea etiquette?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Makoto %}
Ah, maybe it’d be clearer if I had said “tea ceremony”…? It’s part of Japan’s traditional culture to make tea in a specific manner.

It’s not just about drinking the tea, but also a way to discipline yourself to polish your spirituality and manners and such.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Nagisa v2 %}
…How intriguing. You can learn how to maintain manners and spirituality through tea.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Makoto %}
How about we try it out while we’ve got the chance?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Nagisa curious %}
…We didn’t book beforehand. Would it still be alright?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Makoto %}
The signboard says walk-in entries are fine too, so it should be okay.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Yuzuru %}
Allow me to confirm that with the establishment. Please wait here.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Nagisa v2 %}
…Okay. I’ll be waiting.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Makoto %}
…Oh, he’s back. What’d they say, Fushimi-kun?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Yuzuru %}
They said they have an empty spot, so we would be able to make it if we were to head over there straight away.

We still have time before we have to meet up with everyone. How about we spend our time there?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Makoto %}
Mhm, I like that idea~♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Jin %}
“Those three are off to try out a tea ceremony, huh~ What an elegant thing to do for a bunch of youngsters.”
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Akiomi frown %}
“You will sound like an old man if you say ‘youngsters,’ you know?”

“The short trip has only just begun. Please do enjoy watching the idols entertain themselves.”
