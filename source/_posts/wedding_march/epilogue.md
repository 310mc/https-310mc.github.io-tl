{% bubble Jun v3 %}
Thanks for the hard work~ …Mm? I got a message from someone.

…Ahaha, Morisawa-senpai, please look at this.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki %}
“I’ll send you strawberries once they’re in season”… Ah, from Takamine. It sounds like he’s still bothered by his mistake.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Jun awkward %}
I don’t blame Takamine-kun for thinking broccoli was my fav, though~ He gives me some from time to time, y’see.[^1]

I think that’s where he got the impression that I’m a broccoli type of guy. So yeah, could you let him know that he doesn’t have to worry about it?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki %}
Mhm! I sure will.

That being said… I wonder what the others are talking about…?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shu v2 %}
Ah, Morisawa. There are already a couple of topics trending about the show on social media.

Look at the top one.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki curious %}
…“My miso”?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Jun v3 %}
Ahaha! That one was really unfair~
{% endbubble %}

<div class="msr-narration">
    <p>Flashback to the first day of the Kyoto trip, Arashiyama…</p>
</div>

<div class="msr-narration">
    <p>The surprise event, Confession Under the Autumn Leaves. Nagisa’s turn…</p>
</div>

{% bubble Nagisa v2 %}
“…As the autumn leaves flutter before us, the only desire I have is to confess to you. You always fill my heart with color.”

“…Even when autumn is to finally pass, I wish to walk with you under the autumn trees next year, as well.”
{% endbubble %}

<div class="msr-narration">
    <p>Jun’s turn…</p>
</div>

{% bubble Jun v3 %}
“Ahh\~… A lotta things come to mind when thinking ‘bout autumn, right\~? We’ve got food cravings, exercise, and… um, what was it again?”

“Anyways, I wanna enjoy all sortsa autumn moments with you. Will you still love me, even with the way I am…?”
{% endbubble %}

<div class="msr-narration">
    <p>Chiaki’s turn…</p>
</div>

{% bubble Chiaki srsthinking %}
<th>(A short, love-filled confession… Mm, while I <em>am</em> glad I don’t have to talk for very long… hmm…)</th>

…………

<th>(…!? Oh no, I don’t have much time left—!)</th>
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki smile4 %}
I-I really like you! My miso—
{% endbubble %}

<div class="msr-narration">
    <p>Fades back to the present…</p>
</div>

{% bubble Tatsumi awkward %}
Unfortunately, he ran out of time, so the rest of the footage was cut out.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki frustrated %}
Gahh, that’s so frustrating! I may have said it quickly, but I still managed to say my confession without fumbling! It was supposed to be, “My miso soup can only be tasty if it’s made by you!”[^2]
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Yuzuru %}
Miso soup… I’m afraid that sort of confession doesn’t really fit the standards of today.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Makoto awkward %}
Yeah… It was probably best that it was cut out, maybe…?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Nagisa northinking %}
…………

…What about yours, Makoto-kun?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Makoto curious %}
Mm?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Nagisa serious %}
…You were the only one not to make a confession.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Makoto awkward %}
T-That’s because…

They explained it in the final cut — I had a meeting for the third day, since I was going to be the host… so…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Nagisa serious %}
…But our viewers were hoping to hear your confession, weren’t they?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tatsumi %}
Indeed. The comments kept mentioning Makoto-san’s name all over.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Yuzuru %}
Hmm… Yes, it would be unfair for him to be the only one left out.

How about asking the show’s staff to stream a video for you? We can record one for you right now.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Jun v3 %}
Sounds good~ I’ll record it.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Makoto agape %}
F-Fushimi-kun…? And even Sazanami-kun, too…!?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Jun v3 %}
…Aight, I’ve started recording\~ The floor’s all yours\~♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Makoto awkward %}
Ummm……

Ah! I think I just heard Anzu-chan calling for me! I have to go!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Jun surprised %}
Ah, he ran away!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki grin %}
Fuhahahaha! ☆ You aren’t going anywhere, Yuuki! Not until you give a confession of love to all of us here!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Makoto worried %}
No, no! Please don’t say it in such a misleading wayyy~!

## Translation Notes
[^1]: This is a reference to the feature scout story, <a href="/a_detour_encounter" target="_blank">A Detour Encounter</a>.
[^2]: Originally, Chiaki was going to say “I want you to make my miso soup every day”. The sentence starts with <em>ore no miso</em> (my miso), so I had to re-arrange the sentence to work similarly in English too.
