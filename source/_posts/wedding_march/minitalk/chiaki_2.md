Oh! Anzu! You're at StarPro today, huh?

…Hm? You have a meeting soon, so you have to go to CosPro next?

You're as busy as ever! If you still have time, how about resting here for a bit?

            Mhm, I even have cake I got from Kanata. There are a lot of slices left, so eat as much as you like!

            He's planning to sell this in the Aoumi Aquarium soon. I tried a slice myself, and it was really tasty~♪

            If you're alright with canned juice, there's one here! I went to buy one for myself from the vending machine, and got lucky with the roulette, so now I have two~♪

            I was hoping I could give the second one to someone, so you can have it!

Oh yeah, you're joining us for the recording at Kyoto, right?

I don't think we'll be able to be there for very long, but since it's a wonderful opportunity to see the city, let's make sure to enjoy Kyoto! ☆

Is there anything you'd like to see or try in the city?

            Oh yeah, it's famous for that, isn't it? I'm sure there are plenty of Japanese sweets shops, so we should be able to try out matcha during our break.

            We need to look up all the restaurants to check out while we still can!

            You're interested in maiko, huh!? I'm sure there's a place to experience how it's like as a maiko. How about you try going to one?

            …Hm? You don't want to become one, you just want to learn about them? That sounds more like an interview than touring!

Whenever I go to a different prefecture, I can't help but look for their designated hero.

Regional heroes are allies of justice who protect the people of their region!

I'd love to hear all sorts of things from the hero of Kyoto! ♪

            I'd like to know what he does around the place, and why he became a hero, and what's his ambitions as a hero… I wouldn't even know which question to begin with!
