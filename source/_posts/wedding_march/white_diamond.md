    <p>Flashback — A few weeks ago…</p>
</div>

{% bubble Midori sigh %}
The photoshoot’s finally over…

I’m exhausted… Working with new people for the first time always feels like I’m at the hairdresser’s…

I really wouldn’t have minded just being left alone, but they just kept pulling me into the conversation… It was really rough…

I know that’s just part of what you gotta do to loosen your nerves and have a smooth photoshoot, but…

That’s <em>exactly</em> why it was so painful… I’m awful at coming up with funny responses.

*Sigh…* I just wanna go back to the dorms already and heal myself through my mascot plushies…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki grin %}
Heeey, Takamine! There you are! I was looking for you.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori worried %}
Ugh—

You’ve got the wrong person, I’m not Takamine Midori…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki grin %}
Fuhahaha! ☆ I never once said “Midori,” and you won’t fool me with that trick!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori sigh4 %}
Ughh… I’m tired enough as it is, why did I have to come across such an exhausting person… Did you want something from me?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki serious %}
Mm? You look worn out… It isn’t that big of a deal, so I can just keep it for another day.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori frown %}
No, you can tell me now… I’m curious to hear what it is, so…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki smile3 %}
Are you sure? Don’t push yourself, okay? But alright, so, the truth is—

I actually got a request from a bridal company, and accepted the job offer alongside Sazanami.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori curious %}
…And?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki grin %}
That’s it! ☆
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori sigh5 %}
<em>Wow</em>, it really wasn’t a big deal at all…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki v2 %}
That’s why I said so earlier!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori frown %}
I didn’t think it was gonna be <em>that</em> stupid… Why’d you come all the way to tell me, anyway?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki v2 %}
Well, you also did a bridal-related job for your shuffle unit, right? Under the unit name of, ermm…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori curious %}
Ring.A.Bell…?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki grin %}
Yeah, that’s the one! I was asked to make “an expression a bridegroom would have when gazing at his beloved one” for the PV, but I struggled at first on how to go about it.

When I consulted Anzu for her advice, she suggested that I take reference from the promotional video Ring.A.Bell took alongside their MV, and got me to watch it.

I kept re-watching how you played your part and analyzed it as much as I could, then I applied it to my own performance, and it worked out in my favor. Thank you, Takamine!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori sigh %}
How am I supposed to respond to that… And why’d Anzu-san have to go and suggest that in the first place…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki grin %}
She didn’t do anything wrong, though! She only recommended the video; she never once mentioned you.

I had quite a few options to reference from, but my eyes were drawn to you the most — maybe because we’re both from the same unit.

That’s just proof that your aura and charm are skyrocketing! You should be proud of yourself!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori sigh %}
Quit with the hyperboles… It’s so overbearing…

It feels gross to know you kept watching me over and over again, but you don’t have to go so far in the first place… I’m aware it’s a successful video, y’know…

Anyway, isn’t it kinda unusual for you and Sazanami-senpai to be paired together…? Do you guys know each other from something?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki v2 %}
Hmm, well… The first time I met him was when—
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori surprised %}
Wh— Why’re you suddenly narrating a whole backstory… You don’t have to tell me if it’s gonna take forever.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki v2 %}
Don’t be like that! Plus, isn’t it good for you to learn more about other people?

I first met Sazanami at Project Saga. We fought against each other at the Rebirth Live — I was in Rain-bows, and he was in Lilith.

Back then, he was, how do I put it… He was pretty hostile, so I wasn’t sure how things would play out, but…

After working with him again, I’ve come to learn that he’s an honest, friendly guy. He was really frank with me from the moment we started our filming, and we had a peaceful time working together.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori serious %}
Peaceful time, huh… Yeah, I can imagine that. He’s kind to people like me, too, so…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki v2 %}
Oh, you two know each other?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori sigh3 %}
No, he’s just an acquaintance from the same Circle… Sometimes we borrow manga from each other and share our thoughts, but that’s about it.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki grin %}
Oh, really!? You’re on close terms with Sazanami, then! ☆
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori v2 %}
I <em>just</em> said he’s an acquaintance… Could you please <em>try</em> to listen to what I’m saying?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki v2 %}
That’s what I understood from listening to you. Acquaintances don’t typically lend each other their belongings, y’know?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori sigh2 %}
Yeah, well, that’s just how it is in the Manga Club.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki grin %}
Fuhahaha! ☆ Your dad is happy to know that your friend circle has expanded so much more since the day he met you!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori frown %}
You’re not my dad, though?
{% endbubble %}

{% img /img/es/eventstory/weddingmarch/white1_2.jpg %}

{% bubble Jun v3 %}
Oh, it’s Takamine-kun and Morisawa-senpai! Heyaa~♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori serious %}
Ah, hello. I hope you’ve been doing well.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki grin %}
Sazanami! What a coincidence — We were just talking about you!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Jun v3 %}
About me? You gotta let me in on the info~
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki v2 %}
Don’t worry, it wasn’t anything bad. I just learned that you’re getting along with Takamine over at your Circle! ☆

As his senior from Ryuseitai, I really appreciate that! I’d love it if you could keep getting along with him!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori sigh %}
<em>Please</em> don’t act like my guardian, it’s so embarrassing…

Sazanami-senpai, I heard you worked on a job with Morisawa-senpai. Wasn’t it rough working with someone so obnoxious and suffocating?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Jun v3 %}
Not at all~ Morisawa-senpai is a real nice guy; he was always so considerate of me.

It was seriously a tough job, so he helped me out a lot by being such a lively person to be around.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori serious %}
A tough job? Did you guys do something other than a PV?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Jun awkward %}
Nah, that’s the exact thing I was struggling with~ I’ve never once thought about romance before, so a job all about marriage is <em>tough</em>…

But thanks to the video Morisawa-senpai told me about, I got through it somehow~♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori worried %}
I see.

…Ah!

Don’t tell me that video is—
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki grin %}
Yep, it was Ring.A.Bell’s promotional video! ☆
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori sigh4 %}
Of <em>course</em> it was… Please don’t ever recommend it to someone ever again.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki curious %}
Huh? But you let it slide just a second ago, because you’re “aware it’s a successful video”…?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori sideeye %}
It’s fine if someone else does it, but *you’re* not allowed to.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki surprised0 %}
Why’s that!?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Jun v3 %}
<th>(Ahaha, so this is how Takamine-kun’s like when Morisawa-senpai’s around, huh~)</th>

<th>(He acts a lot differently from how he is in Manga Club, so it’s kinda new to me…)</th>
{% endbubble %}

<div class="msr-narration">
    <p>Phone rings</p>
</div>

{% bubble Jun shocked %}
<th>(Hm? I got a message on HoldHands—)</th>

…! Morisawa-senpai, please look at this…!
{% endbubble %}

## Chapter 2

<div class="msr-narration">
    <p>That day, at night…</p>
</div>

{% bubble Jun curious %}
Please ‘scuse me~ Ah, nobody’s here yet, huh.

Since we were the only ones asked to come here, I assume it’s about the bridal project?

Huh, did we mess up somewhere…? Can you think of anything we could’ve done wrong, Morisawa-senpai?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki srsthinking %}
…No, not at all.

While we did take a while to get into it because we felt a little embarrassed at first, the filming itself went smoothly, and we even managed to finish it earlier than expected.

I also heard that the staff were delighted by our end product. Do you have any idea, Sazanami?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Jun frown %}
Nope~… Maybe they spotted a mistake in the filming after the fact?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki %}
…Well, there’s no need to be pessimistic about it, then. We both can’t think of anything, and it was never confirmed that we’re here to get a scolding.

It’s possible that they want to show their appreciation for all the excellent work we’ve all done!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Jun v3 %}
Ahaha, I’d love that~
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Eichi %}
Hello. I’m sorry to keep you waiting.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki %}
Tenshouin? Were you asked to come here, too?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Eichi %}
No, I’m the one who called for you two.

Good evening to the both of you. I apologize for asking you to come here on such short notice.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Jun curious %}
I don’t mind, but… Now I <em>really</em> can’t tell why we’re here.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Eichi %}
Oh, the reason why I asked you both here? You’ll know in a second.

First, could you watch this video for me?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki curious %}
A western castle, with chairs lined up… Is this a wedding hall?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Jun serious %}
This PV… It looks real similar to the one we took.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Eichi yare %}
Yes, indeed. According to the client, a rival of theirs publicized this just this afternoon.

It’s got quite the typical traits of a wedding theme, so it’s likely only a coincidence that it overlaps with your PV, but…

The idol industry is quite small, you see. If you were to release your PV after this, I can easily imagine people accusing you of plagiarism.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Jun frown %}
True~ It could even cause a huge stir on the news.

And I’m guessing the client contacted you ‘cause they wanna avoid any unnecessary problems… It’s a real shame, but I bet we’re gonna have to call the project off, huh~…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki serious %}
……………

…Tenshouin, is it really going to be called off?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Eichi serious %}
Well, I won’t say that it’s unavoidable. There’s a likely chance they’ll still publicize it as long as we ask nicely.

However, that is simply your own personal wish in the end. I’m sure you’re well aware that we have to always prioritize the client’s wishes, yes?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki frown %}
…Yeah. It’s just my selfish wish… I’m sure Sazanami’s right; they likely contacted us to cancel the project…

But… The staff members, Sazanami… We <em>all</em> worked extremely hard, through endless trial and error, to create that PV.

I don’t want everyone’s hard work to go to waste.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Eichi %}
…I see. I understand your point of view now.

The two of you seem to be misunderstanding something here.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Jun curious %}
Misunderstanding…?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Eichi %}
Yes, you see — Our client isn’t thinking of taking down their project just yet. They do still plan to drop out of publicizing the PV, but—

They were quite impressed by your work, so they told me they’d like to start the project over from scratch.

Personally, as the one in charge of communication between both parties, this is everything I could ever ask for. Wedding-related projects always have incredible fan reception, and they work well as advertisements.

Right, as for the actual matter I’d like to speak about—
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Jun serious %}
Matter…?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Eichi serious %}
Oh? You look quite sour all of a sudden.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Jun awkward %}
Ah, well, the preface took real long, so I’m getting a bad feeling about this…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki grin %}
Don’t worry, Sazanami! It’s the usual for Tenshouin to talk for hours! ☆
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Eichi %}
Was that supposed to be a follow-up on my behalf…? Well, I digress.

Right, so the matter at hand. As I’ve said, they’ll start the project from scratch.

However, the client asked that the two of you come up with ideas, instead.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki %}
Us?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Eichi %}
Apparently, they’re stuck in a rut right now, feeling as though they can only come up with unoriginal ideas.

The PV that’s being called off also had a song that’s been heard before, outfits that’ve been seen before, and a performance that’s been shown before, so it’s only natural it ended up tossed out.

Therefore, they’d like you to come up with a project whose main selling point is that “idols thought it up” — something that you would also enjoy doing.

It seems your budget is quite abundant, so I believe you could do whatever you like. What do you think?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Jun frown %}
Mmm~… I mean, it’s a lot better than trying to manage through a small budget, and I definitely appreciate that, but…

That just means they’re <em>that</em> enthusiastic about the project, right? It’s a huge responsibility on us~
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki %}
But that makes it all the more worth doing! It’s a shame that the PV won’t see the light of day, but…

I’m happy to know we can make it come to life through a different project instead.

Let’s do our best, Sazanami!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Jun v3 %}
Huh? Ahh~…

Yeah, you’re right.

If we really don’t manage to make a good project, someone’s surely gonna give us feedback on it.

That’s still way better than having all our effort thrown out the door.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Eichi %}
Thank you. I knew you’d agree to it.

I’m looking forward to seeing a bridal project that’s just befitting of you two…♪
{% endbubble %}

## Chapter 3

<div class="msr-location">
    <p><span><b>Location:</b> Starmony Dorm Common Room</span></p>
</div>

{% img /img/es/eventstory/weddingmarch/white3_1.jpg %}

{% bubble Jun frown %}
A bridal project that’s just befitting of us, huh…

Oh yeah, didn’t we have a similar conversation during our break time in the PV filming, too~? The staff asked us what sorta wedding ceremony we’d like to have.

But it was so sudden, I didn’t know what to say\~ I could barely respond… I remember them just switching the topics almost instantly\~
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki %}
Oh yeah, that did happen, didn’t it? I’m amazed you still remember.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Jun awkward %}
Yeah, it’s ‘cause I was thinking in my head, “Why’re you asking a <em>teenager</em>”…♪

Well, they’re gonna fully back us up on this project, but…

I don’t have a clue about weddings, so asking for us to make it unique is a pretty tough request~
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki grin %}
But it isn’t impossible! We may be starting from a blank slate, but that’s exactly why we have full reign to paint it with our own colors!

The higher the risk, the more it fires me up! We only get stronger the greater adversaries we face!

No matter how hard life forces us into a corner, we’ll always turn the tables! With a huge explosion! And a grand victory! That’s what being a hero is all about!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Jun v3 %}
Whoa, you’re super enthusiastic~ I’m no hero, and I’m not even the type to get that fired up, but…

Now that we’ve accepted the job, I’ll make sure to make it a success~
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki grin %}
Yep! Let’s join forces and conquer this hardship together…☆
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tatsumi %}
—Oh? I was wondering who was speaking with such enthusiasm…

Good evening, Chiaki-san, Jun-san.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Jun surprised %}
Tatsumi-senpai…!

We’re so sorry for the noise so late at night! It must’ve been annoying, right!? I promise I’ll learn my lesson!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tatsumi %}
Oh, no, there’s no need to be so formal with me.

However, it is true that it’s the middle of the night. Let’s be a little more quiet, shall we?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Jun v3 %}
Understood! I’ll do exactly as you say, Tatsumi-senpai…♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki curious %}
Sazanami’s mannerisms changed in a flash… Do you two know each other?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tatsumi %}
Yes, we’ve known each other for quite a long time.

I heard that you plan to “conquer this hardship” — Are you perhaps struggling with something at the moment?

It is a clergyman’s duty to help lost lambs, so please allow me to hear your worries.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Jun v3 %}
Ohh! “Kazehaya-senpai’s Confession Booth” in real-time…! ♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki serious %}
“Kazehaya-senpai’s Confession Booth”…?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Jun v3 %}
Oh, you don’t know? It’s a god-tier show, where Tatsumi-senpai responds to listeners’ or guests’ worries~!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tatsumi %}
I’m not worthy to be called “god-tier,” really. I’m not omniscient like God is.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki serious %}
I see… Could you tell me more about how you’re a “clergyman”…?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tatsumi %}
Ah, I apologize. I shouldn’t speak as though this is common knowledge.

You see, I come from a family that runs a church, and we all work as part of our religion. My job is similar to that of a pastor.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki serious %}
A pastor…

……………

Kazehaya, I have a genuine request. Could you please join our team?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Jun surprised %}
Huh!? You’re inviting *Tatsumi-senpai!?*
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tatsumi curious %}
Team…? Whatever do you mean?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki %}
You see, Sazanami and I have to work on a bridal project from scratch, but we haven’t really decided on anything yet.

That being said, an essential part of wedding ceremonies is a pastor, and we should be able to come up with multiple ideas the more people we have on our team.

Of course, we’ll make sure you get paid. So Kazehaya, I’d love it if you could lend us a hand.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Jun worried %}
No, no! We haven’t even arranged anything yet — We’ll just inconvenience Tatsumi-senpai like this, y’know~?

Can’t we at least ask him <em>after</em> we’ve sorted out the basics?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tatsumi %}
I don’t mind at all, though.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Jun surprised %}
What!? You’re okay with it!?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tatsumi %}
Yes. I am simply akin to a pastor, however, so I’m not sure how helpful I will be…

But I cannot overlook those in trouble. If you don’t mind, I’d be glad to assist.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Jun v3 %}
Tatsumi-senpai…! Thank you so much, it’s extremely appreciated!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki %}
Fuhaha! You look so happy, Sazanami. I can practically see a tail wagging behind you~♪

We’ll still need to make sure they accept our project proposal, but — We thankfully have a generously huge budget to work with.

So let’s start by finding more people we can rely on!
{% endbubble %}

<div class="msr-narration">
    <p>Next day, at noon…</p>
</div>

{% img /img/es/eventstory/weddingmarch/white3_2.jpg %}

{% bubble Chiaki grin %}
—Found you, Takamine~! ☆
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori v2 %}
What do you want, Morisawa-senpai… If it’s something pointless like the other day, I’m gonna tie you up to the tree in the courtyard, ‘kay…?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki %}
What an elaborate punishment! It sounds exactly like the sort of predicament a hero of justice could find himself in.

However, worry not! I have a proper reason why I wanted to see you.

This is for you! Give me your hand.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori surprised %}
A capsule toy of a mascot character!? And a <em>super</em> rare one at that!?

Why? It’s not even my birthday…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori sigh4 %}
Oh, I see what this is. There’s a catch to this, isn’t there?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki %}
You guessed it! The truth is—
{% endbubble %}

<div class="msr-narration">
    <p>A few minutes later…</p>
</div>

{% bubble Midori serious %}
Ah, I see… You’d like me to join the project, since I have experience with bridal work…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki grin %}
Yep! We’d have a hundred men’s worth of power on our side if you were with us! You did an outstanding job in Ring.A.Bell, after all! ☆
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori frown %}
No, I didn’t… and I can’t, anyway.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki surprised0 %}
Why not!?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori serious %}
<em>Because</em> I’m a member of Ring.A.Bell. I’m under a contract where I’m not allowed to take any bridal-related jobs for the year.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki sigh %}
Ahh… I suppose there’s no working around that if that’s the case…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
You’re not gonna try to persist? That’s not like you…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki %}
Well, there isn’t much we can do about that, is there? Persisting won’t change anything.

It’s a shame, but I’ll try to find someone else. See you then, Takamine.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori worried %}
Okay… Sorry, I kinda feel bad…

……………

…Please wait a moment, Morisawa-senpai.

Take this capsule toy back. I almost considered keeping it, but…

I barely got to help you out, and I don’t feel right taking it like this…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki %}
No, I’d rather you keep it with you. It’s already yours now!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori curious %}
Are you sure…?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki smile3 %}
Yep! I don’t have anything I could do with it, and I’m sure the mascot character would be much happier under the hands of someone who’d adore it!

Think of it as me, and take great care of it…☆
