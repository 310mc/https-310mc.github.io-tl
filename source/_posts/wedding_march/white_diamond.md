    <p>Flashback — A few weeks ago…</p>
</div>

{% bubble Midori sigh %}
The photoshoot’s finally over…

I’m exhausted… Working with new people for the first time always feels like I’m at the hairdresser’s…

I really wouldn’t have minded just being left alone, but they just kept pulling me into the conversation… It was really rough…

I know that’s just part of what you gotta do to loosen your nerves and have a smooth photoshoot, but…

That’s <em>exactly</em> why it was so painful… I’m awful at coming up with funny responses.

*Sigh…* I just wanna go back to the dorms already and heal myself through my mascot plushies…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki grin2 %}
Heeey, Takamine! There you are! I was looking for you.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori worried0 %}
Ugh—

You’ve got the wrong person, I’m not Takamine Midori…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki grin2 %}
Fuhahaha! ☆ I never once said “Midori,” and you won’t fool me with that trick!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori sighdrop %}
Ughh… I’m tired enough as it is, why did I have to come across such an exhausting person… Did you want something from me?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki serious %}
Mm? You look worn out… It isn’t that big of a deal, so I can just keep it for another day.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori frown %}
No, you can tell me now… I’m curious to hear what it is, so…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki smilesoft %}
Are you sure? Don’t push yourself, okay? But alright, so, the truth is—

I actually got a request from a bridal company, and accepted the job offer alongside Sazanami.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori curious %}
…And?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki grin2 %}
That’s it! ☆
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori sighfrown %}
<em>Wow</em>, it really wasn’t a big deal at all…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki v2 %}
That’s why I said so earlier!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori frown %}
I didn’t think it was gonna be <em>that</em> stupid… Why’d you come all the way to tell me, anyway?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki v2 %}
Well, you also did a bridal-related job for your shuffle unit, right? Under the unit name of, ermm…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori curious %}
Ring.A.Bell…?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki grin2 %}
Yeah, that’s the one! I was asked to make “an expression a bridegroom would have when gazing at his beloved one” for the PV, but I struggled at first on how to go about it.

When I consulted Anzu for her advice, she suggested that I take reference from the promotional video Ring.A.Bell took separate from their MV, and got me to watch it.

I kept re-watching how you played your part and analyzed it as much as I could, then I applied it to my own performance, and it worked out in my favor. Thank you, Takamine!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori sigh %}
How am I supposed to respond to that… And why’d Anzu-san have to go and suggest that in the first place…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki grin2 %}
She didn’t do anything wrong, though! She only recommended the video; she never once mentioned you.

I had quite a few options to reference from, but my eyes were drawn to you the most — maybe because we’re both from the same unit.

That’s just proof that your aura and charm are skyrocketing! You should be proud of yourself!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori sigh %}
Quit with the hyperboles… It’s so overbearing…

It feels gross to know you kept watching me over and over again, but you don’t have to go so far in the first place… I’m aware it’s a successful video, y’know…

Anyway, isn’t it kinda unusual for you and Sazanami-senpai to be paired together…? Do you guys know each other from something?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki v2 %}
Hmm, well… The first time I met him was when—
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori surprised %}
Wh— Why’re you suddenly narrating a whole backstory… You don’t have to tell me if it’s gonna take forever.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki v2 %}
Don’t be like that! Plus, isn’t it good for you to learn more about other people?

I first met Sazanami at Project Saga.[^1] We fought against each other at the Rebirth Live — I was in Rain-bows, and he was in Lilith.

Back then, he was, how do I put it… He was pretty hostile, so I wasn’t sure how things would play out, but…

After working with him again, I’ve come to learn that he’s an honest, friendly guy. He was really frank with me from the moment we started our filming, and we had a peaceful time working together.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori serious %}
Peaceful time, huh… Yeah, I can imagine that. He’s kind to people like me, too, so…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki v2 %}
Oh, do you two know each other?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori frownshake %}
No, he’s just an acquaintance from the same Circle… Sometimes we borrow manga from each other and share our thoughts, but that’s about it.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki grin2 %}
Oh, really!? You’re on close terms with Sazanami, then! ☆
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori v2 %}
I <em>just</em> said he’s an acquaintance… Could you please <em>try</em> to listen to what I’m saying?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki v2 %}
That’s what I understood from listening to you. Acquaintances don’t typically lend each other their belongings, y’know?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori yare %}
Yeah, well, that’s just how it is in the Manga Club.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki grin2 %}
Fuhahaha! ☆ Your dad is happy to know that your friend circle has expanded so much more since the day he met you!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori frown %}
You’re not my dad, though?
{% endbubble %}

{% img /img/es/eventstory/weddingmarch/white1_2.jpg %}

{% bubble Jun v3 %}
Oh, it’s Takamine-kun and Morisawa-senpai! Heyaa~♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori serious %}
Ah, hello. I hope you’ve been doing well.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki grin2 %}
Sazanami! What a coincidence — We were just talking about you!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Jun v3 %}
About me? You gotta let me in on the info~
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki v2 %}
Don’t worry, it wasn’t anything bad. I just learned that you’re getting along with Takamine over at your Circle! ☆

As his senior from Ryuseitai, I really appreciate that! I’d love it if you could keep getting along with him!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori sigh %}
<em>Please</em> don’t act like my guardian, it’s so embarrassing…

Sazanami-senpai, I heard you worked on a job with Morisawa-senpai. Wasn’t it rough working with someone so obnoxious and suffocating?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Jun v3 %}
Not at all~ Morisawa-senpai is a real nice guy; he was always so considerate of me.

It was seriously a tough job, so he helped me out a lot by being such a lively person to be around.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori serious %}
A tough job? Did you guys do something other than a PV?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Jun awkward %}
Nah, that’s the exact thing I was struggling with~ I’ve never once thought about romance before, so a job all about marriage is <em>tough</em>…

But thanks to the video Morisawa-senpai told me about, I got through it somehow~♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori worried0 %}
I see.

…Ah!

Don’t tell me that video was—
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki grin2 %}
Yep, it was Ring.A.Bell’s promotional video! ☆
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori sighdrop %}
Of <em>course</em> it was… Please never recommend it to someone ever again.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki curious %}
Huh? But you let it slide just a second ago, because you’re “aware it’s a successful video”…?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori sideeye %}
It’s fine if someone else does it, but *you’re* not allowed to.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki surprised0 %}
Why’s that!?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Jun v3 %}
<th>(Ahaha, so this is how Takamine-kun’s like when Morisawa-senpai’s around, huh~)</th>

<th>(He acts a lot differently from how he is in Manga Club, so it kinda feels new to me…)</th>
{% endbubble %}

<div class="msr-narration">
    <p>Phone rings</p>
</div>

{% bubble Jun shocked %}
<th>(Hm? I got a message on HoldHands—)</th>

…! Morisawa-senpai, please look at this…!
{% endbubble %}

## Chapter 2

{% img /img/es/eventstory/weddingmarch/white2_1.jpg %}

<div class="msr-narration">
    <p>That day, at night…</p>
</div>

{% bubble Jun curious %}
Please ‘scuse me~ Ah, nobody’s here yet, huh.

Since we were the only ones asked to come here, I assume it’s about the bridal project?

Huh, did we mess up somewhere…? Can you think of anything we could’ve done wrong, Morisawa-senpai?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki srsthinking %}
…No, not at all.

While we did take a while to get into it because we felt a little embarrassed at first, the filming itself went smoothly, and we even managed to finish it earlier than expected.

I also heard that our client was delighted by our end product from the staff members. Do you have any idea, Sazanami?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Jun frown %}
Nope, not a clue~… Maybe they spotted a mistake in the filming after the fact?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki %}
…Well, there’s no need to be pessimistic about it, then. We both can’t think of anything, and it was never confirmed that we’re here to get a scolding.

It’s possible that they want to show their appreciation for all the excellent work we’ve all done!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Jun v3 %}
Ahaha, I’d love that~
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Eichi %}
Hello. I’m sorry to keep you waiting.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki %}
Tenshouin? Were you asked to come here, too?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Eichi %}
No. Rather, I’m the one who called for you two.

Good evening to the both of you. I apologize for asking you to come here on such short notice.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Jun curious %}
I don’t mind, but… Now I <em>really</em> can’t tell why we’re here.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Eichi %}
Oh, the reason why I asked you both here? You’ll know in a second.

First, could you watch this video for me?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki curious %}
A western castle, with chairs lined up… Is this a wedding hall?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Jun serious %}
This PV… It looks real similar to the one we took.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Eichi yare %}
Yes, indeed. According to the client, a rival of theirs publicized this just this afternoon.

It’s got quite the typical traits of a wedding theme, so it’s likely only a coincidence that it overlaps with your PV, but…

The idol industry is quite small, you see. If you were to release your PV after this, I can easily imagine people accusing you of plagiarism.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Jun frown %}
True~ It could even cause a huge stir on the news.

And I’m guessing the client contacted you ‘cause they wanna avoid any unnecessary problems… It’s a real shame, but I bet we’re gonna have to call the project off, huh~…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki serious %}
……………

…Tenshouin, is it really going to be called off?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Eichi serious %}
Well, it isn’t necessarily unavoidable. There’s a likely chance they’ll still publicize it as long as we ask nicely.

However, that is simply your own personal wish in the end. I’m sure you’re well aware that we have to always prioritize the client’s wishes, yes?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki frown %}
…Yeah. It’s just my selfish wish… I’m sure Sazanami’s right; they likely contacted us to ask if we could cancel the project…

But… The staff members, Sazanami… We <em>all</em> worked extremely hard, through endless trial and error, to create that PV.

I don’t want everyone’s hard work to go to waste.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Eichi %}
…I see. I understand your point of view now.

The two of you seem to be misunderstanding something here.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Jun curious %}
Misunderstanding…?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Eichi %}
Yes, you see — Our client isn’t thinking of taking down the project just yet. They do still plan to drop out of publicizing the PV, but—

They were quite impressed by your work, so they told me they’d like to start the project over from scratch.

Personally, as the agency in charge of communication between both parties, StarPro management also believes that this is everything they could ever ask for. Wedding-related projects always have incredible fan reception, and they work well as advertisements.

Right, as for the actual matter I’d like to speak about—
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Jun serious %}
Matter…?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Eichi %}
Oh? You look quite sour all of a sudden.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Jun awkward %}
Ah, well, the preface took real long, so I’m getting a bad feeling about this…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki grin2 %}
Don’t worry, Sazanami! It’s the usual for Tenshouin to talk for hours! ☆
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Eichi frown %}
Was that supposed to be a follow-up on my behalf…? Well, I digress.

Right, so the matter at hand. As I’ve said, they’ll start the project from scratch.

However, the client asked that the two of you come up with ideas instead.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki %}
Us?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Eichi %}
Apparently, they’re stuck in a rut right now, feeling as though they can only come up with unoriginal ideas.

The PV that’s going to be called off also had a song that’s been heard before, outfits that’ve been seen before, and a performance that’s been shown before, so it’s only natural it ended up tossed out.

Therefore, they’d like you to come up with a project whose main selling point is that “idols thought it up” — something that you would also enjoy doing.

It seems your budget is quite abundant, so I believe you could do whatever you like. What do you think?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Jun frown %}
Mmm~… I mean, it’s a lot better than trying to manage through a small budget, and I definitely appreciate that, but…

That just means they’re <em>that</em> enthusiastic about the project, right? It’s a huge responsibility on us~
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki %}
But that makes it all the more worth doing! It’s a shame that the PV won’t see the light of day, but…

I’m happy to know we can make it come to life through a different project instead.

Let’s do our best, Sazanami!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Jun v3 %}
Huh? Ahh~…

Yeah, you’re right.

If we really don’t manage to make a good project, someone’s surely gonna give us feedback on it.

That’s still way better than having all our effort thrown out the door.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Eichi %}
Thank you. I knew you’d agree to it.

I’m looking forward to seeing a bridal project that’s just befitting of you two…♪
{% endbubble %}

## Chapter 3

<div class="msr-location">
    <p><span><b>Location:</b> Starmony Dorm Common Room</span></p>
</div>

{% img /img/es/eventstory/weddingmarch/white3_1.jpg %}

{% bubble Jun frown %}
A bridal project that’s just befitting of us, huh…

Oh yeah, I had a similar conversation during our break time in the PV filming, too~ The staff asked me what sorta wedding ceremony I’d like to have.

But it was so sudden, I didn’t know what to say\~ I could barely respond… I remember them just switching the topics almost instantly\~
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki %}
Oh, you were asked something like that? I’m impressed that you still remember.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Jun awkward %}
Yeah, it’s ‘cause I was thinking in my head, “Why’re you asking a <em>teenager</em>”…♪

Well, sounds like they’re gonna fully back us up on this project, but…

I don’t have a clue about weddings, so asking for us to make it unique is a pretty tough request~
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki grin2 %}
But it isn’t impossible! We may be starting from a blank slate, but that’s exactly why we have full reign to paint it with our own colors!

The higher the risk, the more it fires me up! We only get stronger the greater adversaries we face!

No matter how hard life forces us into a corner, we’ll always turn the tables in our favor! With a huge explosion! And a grand victory! That’s what being a hero is all about!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Jun v3 %}
Whoa, you’re super enthusiastic~ I’m no hero, and I’m not the type to get that fired up, but…

Now that we’ve accepted the job, I’ll make sure to make it a success~
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki grin2 %}
Yep! Let’s join forces and conquer this hardship together…☆
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tatsumi %}
—Oh? I was wondering who was speaking with such enthusiasm…

Good evening, Chiaki-san, Jun-san.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Jun surprised %}
Tatsumi-senpai…!

We’re so sorry for the noise so late at night! It must’ve been annoying, right!? I promise I’ll learn my lesson!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tatsumi %}
Oh, no, there’s no need to be so formal with me.

However, it is true that it’s the middle of the night. Let’s be a little more quiet, shall we?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Jun v3 %}
Understood! I’ll do exactly as you say, Tatsumi-senpai…♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki curious %}
Sazanami’s mannerisms changed in a flash… Do you two know each other?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tatsumi %}
Yes, we’ve known each other for quite a long time.

I heard that you plan to “conquer this hardship” — Are you perhaps struggling with something at the moment?

It is a clergyman’s duty to help lost lambs, so please allow me to hear your worries.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Jun v3 %}
Ohh! “Kazehaya-senpai’s Confession Booth” in real-time…! ♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki serious %}
“Kazehaya-senpai’s Confession Booth”…?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Jun v3 %}
Oh, you don’t know? It’s a god-tier show, where Tatsumi-senpai responds to listeners’ or guests’ worries~!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tatsumi %}
It isn’t worthy to be called “god-tier,” really. I’m not omniscient like God is.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki serious %}
I see… Could you tell me more about how you’re a “clergyman”…?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tatsumi %}
Ah, I apologize. I shouldn’t speak as though this is common knowledge.

You see, I come from a family that runs a church, and we all work as part of our religion. My job is similar to that of a pastor.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki serious %}
A pastor…

……………

Kazehaya, I have a genuine request. Could you please join our team?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Jun surprised %}
Huh!? You’re inviting *Tatsumi-senpai!?*
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tatsumi curious %}
Team…? Whatever do you mean?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki %}
You see, Sazanami and I have to work on a bridal project from scratch, but we haven’t really decided on anything yet.

That being said, an essential part of wedding ceremonies is a pastor, and we should be able to come up with multiple ideas the more people we have on our team.

Of course, we’ll make sure you get paid. So Kazehaya, I’d love it if you could lend us a hand.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Jun worried %}
No, no! We haven’t even arranged anything yet — We’ll just inconvenience Tatsumi-senpai like this, y’know~?

Can’t we at least ask him <em>after</em> we’ve sorted out the basics?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tatsumi %}
I don’t mind at all, though.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Jun surprised %}
What!? You’re okay with it!?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tatsumi %}
Yes. I am simply akin to a pastor, however, so I’m not sure how helpful I will be…

But I cannot overlook those in trouble. If you don’t mind, I’d be glad to assist.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Jun v3 %}
Tatsumi-senpai…! Thank you so much, it’s extremely appreciated!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki %}
Fuhaha! You look so happy, Sazanami. I can practically see a tail wagging behind you~♪

We’ll still need to make sure they accept our project proposal, but — We thankfully have a generously huge budget to work with.

So let’s start by finding more people we can rely on!
{% endbubble %}

<div class="msr-narration">
    <p>Next day, at noon…</p>
</div>

{% bubble Chiaki grin2 %}
—Found you, Takamine~! ☆
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori v2 %}
What do you want, Morisawa-senpai… If it’s something pointless like the other day, I’m gonna tie you up to the tree in the courtyard, ‘kay…?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki %}
What an elaborate punishment! It sounds exactly like the sort of predicament an ally of justice could find himself in.

However, worry not! I have a proper reason why I wanted to see you.

This is for you! Give me your hand.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori surprised %}
A capsule toy of a mascot character!? And a <em>super</em> rare one at that!?

Why, though? It’s not even my birthday…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori sighdrop %}
Oh, I see what this is. There’s a catch to this, isn’t there?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki %}
You guessed it! The truth is—
{% endbubble %}

<div class="msr-narration">
    <p>A few minutes later…</p>
</div>

{% bubble Midori serious %}
Ah, I see… You’d like me to join the project, since I have experience with bridal work…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki grin2 %}
Yep! We’d have a hundred men’s worth of power on our side if you were with us! You did an outstanding job in Ring.A.Bell, after all! ☆
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori frown %}
No, I didn’t… and I can’t, anyway.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki surprised0 %}
Why not!?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori serious %}
<em>Because</em> I’m a member of Ring.A.Bell. I’m under a contract where I’m not allowed to take any bridal-related jobs for the year.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki sightired %}
Ahh… I suppose there’s no working around that if that’s the case…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
You won’t try to persist? That’s not like you…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki %}
Well, there isn’t much we can do about that, is there? Persisting won’t change anything.

It’s a shame, but I’ll try to find someone else. See you then, Takamine.

Okay… Sorry, I kinda feel bad…

……………

…Please wait a moment, Morisawa-senpai.

Take this capsule toy back. I almost considered keeping it, but…

I barely got to help you out, and I don’t feel right taking it like this…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki %}
No, I’d rather you keep it with you. It’s already yours now!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori curious %}
Are you sure…?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki smilesoft %}
Yep! I don’t have anything I could do with it, and I’m sure the mascot character would be much happier under the hands of someone who’d adore it!

Think of it as me, and cherish it well…☆
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori frown %}
No thanks… You and mascots are poles apart, like heaven and earth…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori norsmile %}
But… Thank you, Morisawa-senpai.

I know I can’t collaborate with you officially, but if there’s anything else I could help you with, please let me know. I’ll try my best within my capabilities…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki grin2 %}
Mhm, you’ve grown so much, Takamine! ☆ I’d love to ask for your help when the time comes!

{% bubble Chiaki srsthinking %}
I didn’t expect Takamine to reject me…

I was planning under the notion that he’d accept my invitation, so this is a hard hit on me.

Mm~ That means the next person I could ask…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki %}
…Oh! No, no, this isn’t the time. I’m supposed to pick up a friend right now!

I have to get myself together and greet him with a smile! Let’s just forget about the project for now.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shu v2 %}
—Morisawa?

Why are you here? Are you traveling somewhere?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki grin2 %}
Nope, I was actually waiting for your arrival. Welcome back, Itsuki! ☆
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shu v2 %}
I don’t believe we’re close like family for me to reply with “I’m home” in this situation, yet you still came to greet me?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki grin2 %}
You’re the one who messaged me saying you want to see me once you’re back, aren’t you? And what better way to meet you than like this, right?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shu yare %}
How is this “better”? Have you not a clue how enormous an airport is?

Nevertheless, I suppose I should thank you for making the arrangements less time-consuming. And so, take this.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki curious %}
A souvenir from Paris…? You wanted to give this to me?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shu frown %}
Hmph! Look at it much more closely.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki surprised %}
…Wha!? T-This is…!

The handkerchief I thought I lost…![^2]
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shu v2 %}
So it really <em>was</em> yours after all.

I found it in the atelier just recently. It looked to be the most typical tourist item you could find, so the moment I heard that you lost a souvenir, I made sure to bring it back with me to Japan.

Even if my assumption was incorrect, my other likely suspects would have been Kiryu or Tsukinaga, considering it was in the atelier.[^3]
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki %}
I see…! So it was in your atelier all along! *That’s* why I couldn’t find it no matter how many times I searched my suitcase.

I’m sorry for the trouble. Let me repay you somehow — How about I carry your luggage?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shu yare %}
I’d rather you don’t. I have valuable items inside, so I can’t risk having them damaged.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki %}
Alright, then is there anything I could buy for you?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shu frown %}
Why are you acting like a parent trying to appease their child…? There is nothing you could buy for me. If I desire something, I can simply acquire it on my own.

I suppose if I <em>must</em> choose something, I’d request a job that best suits me. I doubt that is something you could provide me with, however.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki %}
A job, huh… Oh!

Alright then, I can definitely make that a reality!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shu glare %}
Make it a reality…? Since when did *you* become a producer?

{% bubble Jun v3 %}
…Hello? Hope you’re doing well, Morisawa-senpai.

How’s the scouting going?

Ohh? You got Itsuki-senpai from Valkyrie onboard?

…Ah! No need to introduce him to me. I know Itsuki-senpai~

Kagehira-san’s told me all about him, and we’ve talked plenty of times before~♪

I think it’s a great idea to get him on the team. He’s real good at making outfits, after all~

We still haven’t thought up a plan for the project, but it’s been confirmed that we’re gonna redo the whole PV, so…

It’ll look way more polished if we were to have Itsuki-senpai make the outfits for us, instead of using ready-made ones~♪

Ah, no, I still haven’t found anyone… I tried asking Isara-san, since I know him from Manga Club and he was part of Ring.A.Bell…

…Yep, exactly. He rejected the offer for the same reason.

But he told me to try asking Yuuki-san, so I messaged him on HoldHands~ I’m still waiting on a response from him.

…Ahaha, whatcha mean, “Wedding Master”\~? I’m sure Yuuki-san doesn’t know that much, either\~

It’s just that he’s a carefree guy who’s also real good at collecting info, so I’m sure he’ll help us out~ That’s all.

…Yeah, I’ll let you know if there are any updates. Aight, see ya later then~

<th>(I didn’t expect us to get Itsuki-senpai of all people on this project. Morisawa-senpai sure is something~ I gotta do my best, too.)</th>

<th>(Hm, I need to come up with a plan B if Yuuki-san rejects the offer, too…)</th>
{% endbubble %}

<div class="msr-narration">
    <p>Nagisa appears</p>

{% bubble Jun v3 %}
<th>(Ohii-san’d be a good choice for this theme, but since he’s always trying to be the main lead, he might stand out too much… Like, to the point where he might just take the whole spotlight for himself.)</th>

<th>(I wouldn’t have minded it if this were a job for CosPro, but… since other agencies are involved, it’d be wise to leave him out of the potential candidates…)</th>

——Woah!? Nagi-senpai, how long have you been here!?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Nagisa v2 %}
…Since you were talking on the phone.

…I didn’t want to interrupt such an important conversation, so I waited on the sofa until you were finished.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Jun awkward %}
You wouldn’t have interrupted anything~ There’s no need to be so considerate to someone like me.

Anyway, I’m gonna get something to drink, too. I’m starting to feel thirsty after talking for so long~
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Nagisa curious %}
…Jun, what was that about “Wedding Master”?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Jun sad4 %}
Gfph!? <em><th>(chokes on drink)</th></em>
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Nagisa worried %}
…Are you alright?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Jun awkward %}
Y-Yeah, I’m good…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Nagisa v2 %}
…I’m glad. Then, I ask again: what is “Wedding Master”? Is it some sort of role? An occupation, perhaps?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Jun v3 %}
Oh, nah. Y’see—
{% endbubble %}

<div class="msr-narration">
    <p>A few minutes later…</p>
</div>

{% bubble Nagisa v2 %}
…I see. So that’s what happened.

……………

…Shall I help you out?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Jun v3 %}
Huh? But Nagi-senpai, we haven’t even decided on what we’re gonna do.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Nagisa v2 %}
…Yes. For that reason, my interest has been piqued.

…I am always walking on the rail tracks that Ibara has placed down. It does not hold me down in any way, nor am I dissatisfied.

…But after hearing your story, it made me want to try veering away from those tracks, just a little bit. I now have the urge to try walking down a path that does not yet exist on a map.

…Please let me join your team.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Nagisa curious %}
…May I?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Jun v3 %}
Well, there’s no problem with you joining, and I’d actually really appreciate that, but…

Would Ibara even let you~…?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Nagisa v2 %}
…Don’t worry. I’ll talk to Ibara myself.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Jun v3 %}
Really? Great, that’d be perfect! Then maybe we should get Ibar—

{% bubble Chiaki %}
Excuse meeeee!

Morisawa Chiaki has made his arrival!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shu frown %}
You’re too noisy, Morisawa. Quiet down.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki %}
Fuhaha, sorry! This meeting feels like a gathering in a secret base, so I got excited! ☆

One, two, three, four, five… Alright, we’re all here!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Jun v3 %}
Yep. I know it’s not the meeting time yet, but how about we start?

Hey everyone, thanks for coming today— Well, it’s not <em>just</em> for today… Anyways, the point is, thanks for coming here for our sake.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki %}
Mhm! I’m so deeply moved by how many people were willing to help us…! I don’t even have the words to describe how I feel!

But we won’t get anywhere by staying quiet. So I’ll express my gratitude as I introduce our fellow members!

First we have Itsuki Shu! He may be hard to please, but he’s a reliable person who’s always looking out for others! We were classmates back in school! ☆
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shu v2 %}
I don’t see why you needed to mention all of that… Regardless, I’m Itsuki Shu. I’ll be working on this project with all of you.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki %}
Next up is the man who rescues lost lambs! Kazehaya Tatsumi!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tatsumi %}
Hello, I’m Kazehaya Tatsumi. I believe that weddings are one’s happiest moment in life.

Now that I’m part of the team, I’d like to cooperate with everyone in making this a wonderful event.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Jun v3 %}
I’ll introduce the next two~ I can’t think of how to introduce ‘em, so I’ll just say their names… This is Nagi-senpai— As in, Ran Nagisa-san, and—

This is Yuuki Makoto-san from Trickstar. Thanks for accepting our invitation~
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Makoto %}
Thanks for having me, as well!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Nagisa v2 %}
…It’s a pleasure to make your acquaintance.

…Jun. I spoke to Ibara, as I promised.

…He said, “Yes, do as you please, your Excellency!”, and “Please do consider Jun as my substitute, and work him to the bone! ☆”
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Jun v3 %}
I can already imagine what sorta expression he had when saying that\~ Aight then, that’s settled\~♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Makoto %}
Ooh, the only people from the same unit here are Sazanami-kun and Nagisa-san, so the rest of us don’t seem as though we’ve got any connections, but—

It’s basically just StarPro and CosPro idols here, huh~?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki %}
Yep! Thankfully, less agencies involved means it’ll be overall easier to make adjustments for our plans!

Alright, since we’ve started casually chatting to each other now, it’s about time we discussed the main matter. As you know, the PV Sazanami and I performed for the bridal company was dropped.

Instead, they’ve tasked us with coming up with a bridal project that idols would enjoy, so that they can make an even more successful PV than the first.

It goes without saying that two heads are better than one, so with the six of us here, there’s nothing to be afraid of! Let’s share our thoughts, and make that victory ours…☆
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tatsumi curious %}
You seem to speak and act just like an “ally of justice”…?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shu frown %}
That would be because he’s a dedicated tokusatsu fan. I watched the PV that was tossed out in order to use it as reference, but—

It was truly nothing but a plain, uncreative production.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Makoto %}
Ahaha… Well, it was for a company and everything, so I think it worked just fine. It had all the typical stuff you’d see in a wedding.

Anyway, I actually researched all the bridal-themed jobs idols have been in before, so that we can avoid doing the same ideas.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki grin2 %}
Wow, really!? You did all of that without us even asking!? That’s incredible! You’re exactly like a support character from a super sentai show! ☆
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Nagisa curious %}
…Support character?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki grin2 %}
Mhm, allow me to explain! A support character is a non-combat member who supports the heroes from the back, while they’re off fighting the evil organiza—
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shu v2 %}
That’s more than enough, Morisawa. You can continue this conversation after we’re done with the meeting.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki %}
Oh, you’re right. Alright, go ahead and continue, Yuuki.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Makoto %}
O-Okay! So from my research, I found a couple of bridal projects aside from the PV you did.

Among ES idols, there was the one by Ring.A.Bell[^4], and the wedding-themed song by UNDEAD[^5]… If we were to count idols outside of ES, it’d exceed more than ten different projects.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tatsumi %}
More than ten… It’s going to be difficult to avoid every idea from other companies, then.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Makoto %}
It’s true that we can’t avoid every single idea, but we could definitely avoid it enough by going for something more peculiar.

The common traits are “two people all alone together” and “calming background music”. There are some differences, but most of the projects have a similar atmosphere to them. So if we could just move away from those features—
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Jun v3 %}
—We could make a real unique project, right? That sounds like a great idea. Let’s think up stuff that could achieve that~♪

The opposite of “two people all alone” would be multiple people, and the opposite of “calming” would be something really noisy, I guess…? Hmm…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Nagisa v2 %}
…How does a variety show sound?

…I was reminded of the event where various idols competed in a humorous setting—

…And I heard it was well-received not only among fans, but people watching from the television, as well.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Jun v3 %}
You’re talking about Bogie Time[^6], right? The six of us here aren’t a group you see every day, so I bet we could make something big again~♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki %}
Ooh, a variety show, huh…

In that case, I’d love it if we could perform it in an actual location, rather than a studio. Itsuki—
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shu hmph %}
*Non!* Nobody’s allowed to use my atelier!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki surprised0 %}
Wha—!? How’d you know I was going to say that!? Are you a mind-reader!?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Makoto %}
Since it’s a wedding, the first thing that comes to mind is Hawaii or Guam, but… While we may have a huge budget, I don’t think traveling overseas is really an option.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Jun v3 %}
Then we’ll have to do it somewhere in Japan, right? Hmm, where would be best…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Nagisa v2 %}
…How about Kyoto?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Jun curious %}
Kyoto?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Nagisa v2 %}
…Jun. Kyoto is one of the prefectures in the Kansai region.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Jun awkward %}
N-No, I know that~ Why’d you explain it to me like I’m a grade schooler…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Nagisa v2 %}
…Hiyori-kun said that you can only name four prefectures.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Jun sigh %}
<em>Ugh</em>, man… I just panicked during the show, that’s all — I know the famous places at least, really.

But anyway, why Kyoto?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Nagisa v2 %}
…I often spot commercials enticing you to travel to Kyoto. It made me curious to know why people go there, and what lies in the prefecture.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Makoto %}
Ahaha, sounds like the commercials did their job perfectly, huh? I personally went to Kyoto for my school field trip.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Nagisa v2 %}
…School field trip?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Makoto %}
Hm? You’ve never gone on one before?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki niyaclosed %}
Fuhaha! I haven’t either! Our generation wasn’t one where we could enjoy the wonders we can so easily experience now! ☆
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shu frown %}
Why are you saying that with such pride? For goodness’ sake…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tatsumi %}
I have not experienced it before either, and neither has Jun-san, I assume. CosPro’s academies don’t offer any school trips.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Makoto %}
Oh, really…? We had some classmates who couldn’t join us because of work, but the rest of us got to experience it, so… It somehow feels weird that I’m the only one here who’s been on one before.

…Ah, I know! How about we go to Kyoto and do a variety show that feels like a field trip?

I’m sure our fans would enjoy watching us having a fun trip, too.

But most of all, we won’t end up with the same idea as other rival companies by mashing “bridal” and “field trip” together.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki grin2 %}
Hm, hm! A “bridal field trip,” huh! It doesn’t sound bad at all!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Jun v3 %}
“Bridal field trip”… That sounds super gimmicky~
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shu v2 %}
Indeed. It sounds cheap, unrefined, and unpolished.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Jun surprised %}
T-That’s <em>seriously</em> not what I said, though…!?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki grin2 %}
Oh, don’t be shy! If you’ve got any complaints, let’s hear them! Camaraderie is all about talking heart-to-heart — So come on, Itsuki, Sazanami!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Jun awkward %}
No, I don’t have any complaints, though…

Hm? Why’re you tugging my sleeve, Nagi-senpai?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Nagisa v2 %}
…I’m sorry for interrupting as you are being doted on by your senior.

…However, I feel as though the topic is derailing now — Does that mean we’ve finished our meeting?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Jun v3 %}
Ah… Yeah, let’s move on. Some of us here have work in the evening, so…

Let’s focus on the meeting for now. We’ll work out the details ‘til we finalize a project that’ll make everyone involved happy~♪
