Ooh, Transfer student! What's wrong, what's up? Do you have business with Sagami-sensei?

He just left his seat to go buy some alcohol.

{% bubble Chiaki sighdrop %}
Personally, I'd rather he doesn't drink so much… But he told me it's to relieve stress…

              Yeah. Not just overdrinking, but drinking in of itself is a pretty bad idea!

              Huh? Once you become a working adult, it's common to make connections through drinking…?

              That's true, I suppose. Mm… Adults have it so rough.

Transfer student? We're coming across each other a lot in the infirmary lately.

Did you injury yourself in some predicament? If so, just call for me as loud as you can!

              But "hero" is just so much cooler, and it makes me happy to be called that!

              But if someone were attacked by a villain in a hero show, they wouldn't say, "Please save me, Morisawa-senpai!", would they?

              I think it's natural to hope someone asks for help by calling for the "hero" in those cases, y'know?
