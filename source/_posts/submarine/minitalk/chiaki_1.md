{% bubble Chiaki %}
Heheh, there are Okinawa souvenirs here!

Oh, Sengoku, they have a handful of mascots. Which do you think would suit Takamine?

Since you’re the same age as him, I’d be happy to get your advice on which to get him!

            Oh, good choice! It's part of Okinawan culture, after all!

            Thank you, Sengoku, it's perfect! And since it should work as an amulet as well, it's like two for the price of one!

            Heheh, those would be a better gift for Kanata, wouldn't they?

            You’re right, Takamine would love a mascot souvenir based on a vegetable!

            Hahaha, I'm glad I asked you, Sengoku! Your ninja detection skills always come to great use…☆

{% bubble Chiaki frown %}
You can't have a ryokan trip without a pillow fight… I do want to agree with that, but—

Comet Show only happened a few weeks ago, so I feel like we should have a discussion with each other first.

With that being said, I'd like to ask you something, Kanata. Where am I going wrong whenever we talk about it? I'd like your help in understanding that.

            perhaps the Timing.

        <div class="minitalk-option_content">
            {% bubble Chiaki srsthinking %}
            Hm… so what I discussed earlier was also simply just the wrong timing?

            But SS is an important event… We can't keep dancing around the topic, can we…?

            Oh… so that's why you suggested the pillow fight, huh…?

            I keep talking about serious topics so much, that I'm being seen as someone who can't read the r—… That's not what you meant?

            {% bubble Chiaki sad2 %}
            Ah, even discussing it is dismissed… Working towards a solution really is too difficult right now after all, huh…

            Alright, I'll try and figure out where I went wrong on my own for now! Sorry for taking up your time, Kanata.

{% bubble Chiaki curious %}
Oh yeah, where'd Kanata go?

He tends to go to the watersides at every opportunity, so maybe he's gone to bathe in the sea?

Nagumo, have you heard anything from Kanata? Or if you've seen him head off to the beach, or something of the sort.

            Oh, that's a shame… I was hoping we could all talk about our plan for Ryuseitai.

            Oh well, we'll just have to work together and find him. Is that alright, Nagumo?

            Heheh, so it was just as I imagined. I knew he'd be drawn to Okinawa's sea.

            Aaalright then, let's go find him! Could you call over the other two, Nagumo?
