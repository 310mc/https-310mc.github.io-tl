I heard the Okinawan idols are powerhouses, yet Akatsuki managed to defeat them all with ease… Unbelievable.

It sounds a bit troubling somehow, but… on the bright side, no problems occurred so far.

Anyway, it's lunch time now! Takamine, make sure you should eat meat and fish too, not just vegetables~♪

            Hm? Why’re you sighing? Are you low on nutrients due to a lack of meat!?

            Listen, Takamine! Eating well will help regulate your mood! Don’t be picky with your food, okay?

            Mhm, that’s good then! I guess I meddled a little too much.

            We’re in Okinawa, y’know? I’d love to see you try a few of their fine cuisine~♪

            Oh, it's good to know you've finished eating, then! I had the wrong idea because of the few vegetables left on your plate.

            You ate so much, Takamine! Wonderful! I'll eat just as much too in hopes of growing bigger! ☆

That all being said, it's surprising to see you complain about your concerns, Kiryu. I've always had the impression of you being a bold and daring guy, ever since The War days—

Oh yeah, actually, while we're at it, can I ask? I'd love to know how things have been going with Akatsuki lately.

I've been having my own worries about Ryuseitai, so maybe I could get an idea of what to do through the way you guys operate.

            Heheh, that's wonderful!

            You guys have been influencial since your days at Yumenosaki, after all! I bet you're doing great nowadays, too.

            Hmmm… You can't get any work opportunities due to the veteran units in the agency? That really does sound rough.

            But you guys in Akatsuki aren't the type to get worn down by this either, Right? I know you'll do great~♪

            Sorry. Don't worry about it if it's too heavy. It's a bad habit of mine to stick my nose in other people's business.

            But I just don't know what to do anymore about Ryuseitai… I've just been stuck in a loop trying to figure it out on my own.

            …Yeah, I should talk to Kanata about all this — He's been by my side with Ryuseitai all this time.

            I'm counting on you, Ryusei Blue! Lend me your strength…!

            Mm, talking to Nagumo sounds like a good idea. I can talk to him as an equal, as he's also had Ryuseitai entrusted to him for a while.

            But… I did something awful to him at Comet Show… I don't know if we'll be able to reach an agreement.

            {% bubble Chiaki serious %}
            …Yeah, there are far too many local idols in trouble right now — The issue is too large for only Ryuseitai to handle.

            That means the only other people I could talk to are Akatsuki. I hope that they're willing to help out as fellow colleagues…
