<div class="msr-narration">
    <p>A week later. During the qualifying round, the final stage…</p>
</div>

{% bubble Kanata v2 %}
“hello okinawa, and welcome\~! *mensooore\~♪*”[^1]
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki %}
“Fuhahaha! Thanks for coming to see our Ryuseitai and Akatsuki live show today! I'm extremely happy to see you all…☆”

“♪\~♪\~♪”
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata v2 %}
“~…♪”
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora %}
…I thought we *weren’t* gonna perform a live show…?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
Yeah… This is the exact opposite of what they said we’d do… Also, I can’t tell if “mensooore” is being used correctly; I can't trust anything Morisawa-senpai says—
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shinobu %}
It was Shinkai-do—Shinkai-senpai who said it, and one can only be a ninja by adapting to every situation, Midori-kun!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
I’m not a ninja…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora %}
Ahaha. Why's all this talk taking me back to the old days? Shinobu-kun speaking normally ‘cuz of his order sounds so weird, though.

Anyways, apparently it’s fine ‘cuz it’s a joint live performance, and not a live battle.

Since it’s not a competitive stage of winners and losers. Even if we end up with the worst case scenario, nobody will have their SSL$ confiscated, either… Well, they said something like that.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
Really? Isn’t that just how our seniors are putting it…?

But I guess back when we were all in Yumenosaki, we managed just fine by believing in their words and pushing through together…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata v2 %}
yes~♪ but ever since ensemble square was established, we also have made a lot of Mistakes—

so i suppose it is Understandable to lose Trust in us.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori worried %}
Eep—! Please don't jump into the conversation out of nowhere, Senpai!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata v2 %}
you should not be Talking right now, anyway~

the people of okinawa are not Familiar with the yumenosaki Tradition to Chat on stage~♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora %}
That’s true. Okinawa may have alotta tourists from all over, but that doesn’t mean everyone’s accepting and understanding of ES’s ways.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shinobu %}
Mhm, when in Rome, do as the Romans do!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki %}
Well, personally, I think it’s okay to behave freely to a certain extent! On the contrary, different cultures and the strange antics that go along with them can actually be amusing to the audience!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora %}
Speaking of strange antics, Morisawa-senpai’s been acting weird since we came to Okinawa, but…

You gonna be okay from here, Ninja-man? You’re not gonna disappear on us in the middle of a performance, are you?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki %}
No worries! I’ve calculated and prepared everything to make sure I only disappear for a moment, without it being unnatural!

I even double-checked with the SS administration committee to make sure if the way I planned it was okay, and they were alright with it!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori sigh %}
Morisawa-senpai’s strong point is that he can casually ask questions even to people who could be attacking him with malicious intent… I could never do that…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shinobu %}
Heheh, I don’t think we need to imitate our seniors. Our differences are what makes us special, and that’s what Ryuseitai’s all about!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora awkward %}
…Yeah, I can’t help but find it a bit off when Shinobu-kun speaks like a regular person.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki %}
Mhm! But I think it’s pretty nice — it makes you look smarter than usual, Sengoku!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shinobu surprised %}
Does that mean I usually look like a bumbling idiot!?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki surprised %}
Whaa…!? Don't take what I say in the wrong way! Why do you guys keep doing that these days!?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata frown %}
yes, it is sad, isn’t it? i do not recall having brought you up to Behave this way, you know~?

but it cannot be helped. after all, this is likely to be a Rebellious phase that came a little late.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora awkward %}
It really annoys me when I get told that I'm going through a rebellious phase, ‘cuz it makes me feel like I’m being treated like a kid…

But the very fact I feel that way is a sign that it *is* that, isn’t it?
{% endbubble %}

{% img /img/es/eventstory/submarine/epch1_2.jpg %}

{% bubble Midori %}
Yeah… But please don’t worry, we don’t plan on going against ES’s orders on top of that…

Just ‘cause I can’t stand the higher-ups doesn’t mean I'm gonna disobey them and risk getting told something stupid again, like to revert Ryuseitai back to its original shape…

Besides, my order was super simple — I just had to avoid touching the “thing” that I love during the qualifying rounds…

And I’m not an infant or something… I can put up with it during the rounds just fine…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki grin %}
The thing that you love? Oh, I get it now! So *that’s* why you kept your distance from me all this time, Takamine!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora awkward %}
You were the one doing all the avoiding, and I think he’s talking about mascots, y’know~?

By the way, I had some pretty dangerously close moments, like when we were tryna stop Kanzaki-senpai. My weakness is that my brain stops workin’ whenever I’m overstimulated.

But nobody from the SS administration committee said anything, so I guess that means I didn’t go overboard.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shinobu %}
Hmm, so… Was Tetora-kun’s order something like, “no violence during the qualifying round”?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora %}
Oh, you could tell just from what I said? — Wait, no, I almost forgot that I shouldn’t confirm anythin’.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki grin %}
You’re on a roll, Sengoku! You’re a paragon of intelligence! Also known as the Genius Sengoku…☆
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shinobu awkward %}
I’d rather not be called by something that sounds like it came from a dictionary… It’s just that I know everyone so well by now, that I can easily tell when they’re acting differently from the usual.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
Yeah, I get you… Whenever we have a sleepover, Tetora-kun always works out at every opportunity, and it’s really overbearing…

That's why I thought for sure his order was “no working out”.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora %}
Well y’see, whenever I work out, I also practice karate forms. I’d hate to have those moves be seen as “violence”, though, so…

Like, y’know how Kanzaki-senpai is a surprisingly calm person who pretty much never resorts to violence, but just seeing him with his sword is enough to freak you out?

So yeah, same thing here — I thought it might be outta line to make any move that a viewer could consider “violence”, so I avoided it just in case.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shinobu %}
Tetora-kun, you’re a lot more particular about things than one would expect, huh? Like you can’t help but overthink things.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori sigh %}
We’re all pretty sensitive people… The only ones in our unit who’re broad-minded and chill enough to get through anything are Shinobu-kun and Shinkai-senpai… the ratio is two to three…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki grin %}
Ohh, you included me in the “sensitive” category, too!? I'm so glad to know that you understand me, Takamine!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori sideeye %}
Hmph… You do realize we’ve known each other long enough that none of us would still think you’re a hot-headed, dumbass hero without a single thought in his head, right… We’ve all seen you read books with glasses on before you sleep…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki worried %}
What do glasses have to do with it!? Hasumi will get mad at you if you start saying anything bad about glasses!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora curious %}
Speaking of which, the members of Akatsuki haven’t come on stage yet, have they?

If they take any longer, we’ll end up stealing the limelight!
{% endbubble %}

## Chapter 3

{% img /img/es/eventstory/submarine/epch3_1.jpg %}

{% bubble Chiaki %}
“♪\~♪\~♪”
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kuro %}
“~…♪ Yo, Morisawa. How about a duet while we’ve got the chance?”
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora worried %}
“Ahh, that’s not <em>fair!</em> Morisawa-senpai just keeps stealing everything that matters to me…!”
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shinobu worried %}
“Awawa, your microphone is on, Tetora-kun! We’ll get flamed online again if you throw careless remarks like that! Don't get involved with Morisawa-senpai! Just keep your eyes only on me!”[^2]
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori sigh %}
“That’s *also* gonna cause its own kind of misunderstanding…”
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Keito %}
“You guys, be serious. Birds of a feather flock together — and as such, don’t let yourself get influenced by Ryuseitai, Kiryu. Be true to our rough-and-tough style.”
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kuro %}
“Hah? What’s the point of a joint performance if we’re just gonna stick to ourselves without influencin’ each other?”
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Keito %}
“Guh… I know there’s nothing I can do about it, but nobody is listening to me this time around. It feels so lonely.”

“No, I should reflect on myself for being so naive in thinking that you guys would always listen to me.”

“I was completely ignorant to the stress you must have felt all this time, due to how I would always do as I lik—”
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kuro %}
“Oh, zip it! Quit lookin’ so gloomy! Don’tcha know the main rule for idols is to smile on stage? So c’mon now! ♪”
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki %}
<th>(Heheh, Kiryu’s incredible as always. He’s always so sincere about being an idol.)</th>

<th>(…I want to do the same—Let’s start from there.)</th>

<th>(We aren’t back to square one, and we haven't lost anything, either… We’ll go back to our baseline, and build up from scratch.)</th>

<th>(I’m good at that sort of thing, and I already know that everyone in Ryuseitai will work hard alongside me.)</th>
{% endbubble %}

{% img /img/es/eventstory/submarine/chiakibcg.jpg %}

{% bubble Chiaki %}
<th>(I’ll never, ever forget the moment you guys rushed over to help me clean up that day, like it was the most natural thing to do. It meant everything to me.)[^3]</th>

<th>(The heroes I’ve waited so long for had finally arrived.)</th>

“♪\~♪\~♪”

## Translation Notes
[^1]: “Mensoore” is an Okinawan greeting.
[^2]: Alongside the switch to no ninja-talk while on stage, Shinobu uses *boku* here instead of his usual *sessha* (the more ninja-like way to refer to oneself).
[^3]: A reference to the last chapter of [Meteor Impact](https://310mc.github.io/meteor_impact/epilogue/#Chapter-2).
