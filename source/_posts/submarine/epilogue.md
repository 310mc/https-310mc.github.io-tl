<div class="msr-narration">
    <p>A week later. During the qualifying round, the final stage…</p>
</div>

{% bubble Kanata v2 %}
“hello okinawa, and welcome\~! *mensooore\~♪*”[^1]
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki grin2 %}
“Fuhahaha! Thanks for coming to see our Ryuseitai and Akatsuki live show today! We’re extremely happy to see you all…☆”

“♪\~♪\~♪”
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata grin %}
“~…♪”
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora curious %}
…I thought we *weren’t* gonna perform a live show…?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori sad2 %}
Yeah… This is the exact opposite of what they said we’d do… Also, I can’t tell if “mensooore” is being used correctly; I can’t trust anything Morisawa-senpai says—
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shinobu norsmile %}
It was Shinkai-do—Shinkai-senpai who said it, and one can only be a ninja by adapting to every situation, Midori-kun!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori frownshake %}
I’m not a ninja…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora smileconfident %}
Ahaha. Why’s all this talk taking me back to the old days? Shinobu-kun speaking normally ‘cuz of his order sounds so weird, though.

Anyways, apparently it’s fine ‘cuz it’s a joint live performance, and not a live battle.

Since it’s not a competitive stage of winners and losers. Even if we end up with the worst case scenario, nobody will have their SSL$ confiscated, either… Well, they said something like that.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori worried %}
Really? Isn’t that just how our seniors are putting it…?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori yare %}
But I guess back when we were all in Yumenosaki, we managed just fine by believing in their words and pushing through together…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata smilesoft %}
yes~♪ but ever since ensemble square was established, we also have made a lot of Mistakes—

so i suppose it is Understandable to lose Trust in us.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori surprised %}
Eep—! Please don’t jump into the conversation out of nowhere, Senpai!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata norsmile %}
you should not be Talking right now, anyway~

the people of okinawa are not Familiar with the yumenosaki Tradition to Chat on stage~♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora norsmile2 %}
That’s true. Okinawa may have a lotta tourists from all over, but that doesn’t mean everyone’s accepting and understanding of ES’s ways.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shinobu smile %}
Mhm, when in Rome, do as the Romans do!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki smileexplain %}
Well, personally, I think it’s okay to behave freely to a certain extent! On the contrary, different cultures and the strange antics that go along with them can actually be amusing to the audience!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora idle %}
Speaking of strange antics, Morisawa-senpai’s been acting weird since we came to Okinawa, but…

You gonna be okay from here, Ninja-man? You’re not gonna disappear on us in the middle of a performance, are you?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki fist %}
No worries! I’ve calculated and prepared everything to make sure I only disappear for a moment, without it being unnatural!

I even double-checked with the SS administration committee to make sure if the way I planned it was okay, and they were alright with it!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori sightired %}
Morisawa-senpai’s strong point is that he can casually ask questions even to people who could be attacking him with malicious intent… I could never do that…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shinobu grin %}
Fufu, I don’t think we need to imitate our seniors. Our differences are what makes us special, and that’s what Ryuseitai’s all about!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora awkward0 %}
…Yeah, I can’t help but find it a bit off when Shinobu-kun speaks like a regular person.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki nod %}
Mhm! But I think it’s pretty nice — it makes you look smarter than usual, Sengoku!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shinobu surprised0 %}
Does that mean I usually look like a bumbling idiot!?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki shocked %}
Whaa…!? Don’t take what I say in the wrong way! Why do you guys keep doing that these days!?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata frownshake %}
yes, it is sad, isn’t it? i do not recall having brought you up to Behave this way, you know~?

but it is what it is. after all, this is likely to be a Rebellious phase that came a little late.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora awkward0 %}
It really annoys me when I get told that I’m going through a rebellious phase, ‘cuz it makes me feel like I’m being treated like a kid…

But the very fact I feel that way is a sign that it *is* that, isn’t it?
{% endbubble %}

{% img https://f005.backblazeb2.com/file/reitoouji/ro_mjUb6759f004m0E4.webp?timestamp=1733947404102 %}

{% bubble Midori norsmile %}
Yeah… But please don’t worry, we don’t plan on going against ES’s orders on top of that…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori sighfrown %}
Just ‘cause I can’t stand the higher-ups doesn’t mean I’m gonna disobey them and risk getting told something stupid again, like to revert Ryuseitai back to its original shape…

Besides, my order was super simple — I just had to avoid touching *that* thing I love during the qualifying rounds…

And I’m not an infant or something… I can put up with it during the rounds just fine…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki grin2 %}
That thing you love? Oh, I get it now! So *that’s* why you kept your distance from me all this time, Takamine!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora curious %}
You were the one doing all the avoiding, and I think he’s talking about mascots, y’know~?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora awkward0 %}
By the way, I had some pretty dangerously close moments, like when we were tryna stop Kanzaki-senpai. One of my weaknesses is that my brain stops workin’ whenever I’m overstimulated.

But nobody from the SS administration committee said anything, so I guess that means I didn’t go overboard.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shinobu norsmile %}
Hmm, so… Was Tetora-kun’s order something like, “no violence during the qualifying rounds”?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora smile %}
Oh, you could tell just from what I said? — Wait, no, I almost forgot that I shouldn’t confirm anythin’.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki grin2 %}
You’re on a roll, Sengoku! You’re a paragon of intelligence! Also known as the Genius Sengoku…☆
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shinobu awkward %}
I’d rather not be called by something that sounds like it came from a dictionary… It’s just that I know everyone so well by now, that I can easily tell when they’re acting differently from the usual.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori serious %}
Yeah, I get you… Whenever we have a sleepover, Tetora-kun always works out at every opportunity, and it’s really overbearing…

That’s why I thought for sure his order was “no working out”.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora norsmile %}
Well y’see, whenever I work out, I also practice karate forms. I’d hate to have those moves be seen as “violence”, though, so…

Like, y’know how Kanzaki-senpai is a surprisingly calm person who pretty much never resorts to violence, but just seeing him with his sword is enough to freak you out?

So yeah, same thing here — I thought it might be outta line to make any move that a viewer could consider “violence”, so I avoided it just in case.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shinobu norsmile %}
Tetora-kun, you’re a lot more particular about things than one would expect, huh? Like you can’t help but overthink things.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori sighdrop %}
We’re all pretty sensitive people… The only ones in our unit who’re broad-minded and chill enough to get through anything are Shinobu-kun and Shinkai-senpai… the ratio is two to three…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki grin %}
Ohh, you included me in the “sensitive” category, too!? I’m so glad to know that you understand me, Takamine!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori sideeye %}
Hmph… You do realize that none of us would still think you’re a hot-blooded, dumbass hero without a single thought in his head, right… Not when you read books while wearing glasses before you sleep…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki worried %}
What do glasses have to do with it!? Hasumi will get mad at you if you start saying anything bad about glasses!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora curious %}
Speaking of which, the members of Akatsuki haven’t come on stage yet, have they?

If they take any longer, we’ll end up stealing the limelight!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki smileconfident %}
“♪\~♪\~♪”
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kuro norsmile %}
“~…♪ Yo, Morisawa. How about a duet while we’ve got the chance?”
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora shocked %}
“Ahh, that’s not <em>fair!</em> Morisawa-senpai just keeps stealing everything that matters to me…!”
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shinobu worried %}
“Awawa, your microphone is on, Tetora-kun! We’ll get flamed online again if you throw careless remarks like that! Don’t get involved with Morisawa-senpai! Just keep your eyes only on me!”[^2]
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori sighdrop %}
“That’s *also* gonna cause its own kind of misunderstanding…”
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Keito frown %}
“You guys, be serious. Birds of a feather flock together — and as such, don’t let yourself get influenced by Ryuseitai, Kiryu. Be true to our rough-and-tough style.”
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kuro smilesoft %}
“Hah? What’s the point of a joint performance if we’re just gonna stick to ourselves without influencin’ each other?”
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Keito sighdrop %}
“Guh… I know there’s nothing I can do about it, but nobody is listening to me this time around. It feels so lonely.”

“No, I should reflect on myself for being so naïve in thinking that you guys would always listen to me.”

“I was completely ignorant to the stress you must have felt all this time, due to how I would always do as I lik—”
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kuro grin %}
“Oh, zip it! Quit lookin’ so gloomy! Don’tcha know the main rule for idols is to smile on stage? So c’mon now! ♪”
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki smile %}
<th>(Heheh, Kiryu’s incredible as always. He’s always so sincere about being an idol.)</th>

<th>(…I want to do the same — Let’s start from there.)</th>

<th>(We aren’t back to square one, and we haven’t lost anything, either… We’ll go back to our baseline, and build up from scratch.)</th>

<th>(I’m good at that sort of thing, and I already know that everyone in Ryuseitai will work hard alongside me.)</th>
{% endbubble %}

{% img https://f005.backblazeb2.com/file/reitoouji/ro_5kpE6759eeb3DV34.webp?timestamp=1733947065727 %}

{% bubble Chiaki smilesoft2 %}
<th>(I’ll never, ever forget the moment you guys rushed over to help me clean up that day, like it was the most natural thing to do. It meant everything to me.)</th>[^3]

<th>(The heroes I’ve waited so long for had finally arrived.)</th>

“♪\~♪\~♪”

## Translation Notes

[^1]: Meaning “Welcome” in <em>uchinaaguchi</em> (Okinawan) language.
[^2]: Alongside the switch to no ninja-talk while on stage, Shinobu uses the first-person pronoun <em>boku</em> here, instead of his usual <em>sessha</em> (the more ninja-like way to refer to oneself). He also refers to Chiaki by <em>-senpai</em> instead of <em>-dono</em>.
[^3]: Referring to the last chapter of <a href="/meteor_impact/epilogue/#Chapter-2" target="_blank">Meteor Impact</a>.
