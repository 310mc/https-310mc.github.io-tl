## Chapter 3

{% note cw %}
**Content Warning:** Emetophobia
{% endnote %}
{% note location %}
**Location:** Tropical Island Sandy Beach
{% endnote %}

{% note narration %}
**Time:** Around an hour later
{% endnote %}
{% bubble Chiaki %}
That’s enough!

No wrongdoer can escape their just dues! No evil shall prosper for as long as we, Ryuseitai, exist!

The evil deed you’re all committing is *violence!* The desire to shed blood and hurt one another to attain something!

You can’t allow such evil to take control of you! You all need to stop fighting each other!

Why do you think we have a mouth to speak, a heart to feel, and words to express ourselves with? It’s so you can talk it out with your foe and get along with one another!
{% endbubble %}
{% img /img/es/eventstory/submarine/p1ch3_1.jpg %}
{% bubble Keito %}
Morisawa.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki %}
Oooh, Hasumi! I see Kiryu and Kanzaki-kun, too! All of Akatsuki are here, huh!?

Okinawa is filled with idols I’ve never interacted with before, so I’m relieved to see familiar faces~♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Keito %}
You can leave that aside for a moment—I’d like to know what you’re doing here.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki %}
Why, to save you all, of course!

There’s a horrible life-or-death battle occurring in Okinawa! Actually, it wouldn’t be an exaggeration to say that a *war* is breaking out!

But you guys wouldn’t have known that due to your delayed arrival, so I was worried that you fell victim to the other idols!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Keito %}
Hmm… So the people who attempted to assault us really were nothing but idols, huh.

It seems my assumption was correct. I suspected that they were regular people simply pretending to be a threat, raising their microphones up high as if they were weapons.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki %}
They may just be idols, but believe me when I say the Okinawa idol groups are immensely powerful! They’ll wipe you out if you aren’t careful!

And so, although we aren’t the strongest unit out there—as fellow brethren from the same company, we’ll assist y—
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Keito %}
That won’t be necessary.

We’ve defeated all the idols that were foolish enough to challenge us.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki %}
Woah, that quickly!? Incredible! I see your procedures are as precise and swift as usual! But if possible, I would have rather you waited for the heroes of justice to come to the rescue, y’know!?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Keito %}
We don’t need your assistance. We aren’t weaklings who’d fall prey to evil, and neither are we in a position capable of asking for help from “heroes of justice”.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki %}
No, you’re mistaken! Mutual understanding is all you need for your friendship to blossom with someone, even if they’re a god! And since we’re friends, there’s no reason why I can’t save you!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Keito %}
Hmph, that is simply how *you* feel. It’s because you always take action based on your own feelings that it’s impossible for me to trust you so-called “heroes of justice”.

You all judge others based on emotions alone—Who do you think you are? A god?[^1]
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kuro %}
Yo, chill… Drop the manga refs for a sec, we need a rundown of what’s goin’ on.

It’s frustratin’ that we’re getting caught up in this mess without even knowin’ why.

You seem to know a thing or two, Morisawa. Couldja tell us the hell’s goin’ on here?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki %}
Oooh, Kiryu! I was worried you’d be feeling unwell, but you seem to be doing alright! I’m so glad!

The boat ride must have been rough, wasn’t it? You can’t handle vehicles all too well, so I was worried that you’d feel too sick to stand!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kuro %}
Haha… Yeah, it’s actually takin’ all my effort to keep myself from droppin’ dead.

But considerin’ we accepted their challenge and all, I’m basically onstage right now as an idol.

I can’t be lookin’ all pathetic in front of all these other people, so I’m pushin’ myself through this as much as I can.
{% endbubble %}
{% img /img/es/eventstory/submarine/p1ch3_2.jpg %}
{% bubble Souma v3 %}
Haha, Hasumi-dono and I alone were sufficient enough to rout such miniscule foes.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Keito %}
Yeah, we would have taken their challenge and won it just fine even if Kiryu weren’t here. Need I remind you that we’re none other than Akatsuki?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki awkward %}
That’s pretty terrifying… I thought you guys were more obedient lately, but you really are a combative group…

W-Well, either way! You need to know what’s going on, right? You’re probably tired from your long trip, so let’s head over to the ryokan ES booked—
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Souma v3 %}
Hmm… Does this perchance mean that you have come to collect us? I understand well now—I could not deduce the purpose behind your actions at first, due to your verbose manner of speaking.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Keito %}
I suppose we’re the last people who should be saying that, though.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kuro %}
Actually, Morisawa, are there any tasty restaurants nearby?

Not only did I empty my stomach from all the nausea, but needin’ to perform without any breaks in between really took me out… I’m seriously all outta gas.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki %}
Yeah, you look really pale, Kiryu… I’m worried.

Alright then. We aren’t situated at a tourist hotspot, and I’m not from here either, so I don’t have any restaurants in mind, but—

I’ll try searching for something on my phone. Nagumo has been itching to see you for a while, so I’ll call over my comrades, as well.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kuro %}
Haha… I don’t really want Tetsu seein’ this side of me.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Souma v3 %}
<th>(Hrm… Though I am not quite clear on what is happening, it appears that we have solved this matter without any problems.)</th>

<th>(However… Who *were* those *“ai-dols”* that tried to assault us? Their bloodthirsty presence reminded me of *that* “evil,” but—)</th>

<th>(Surely, that must not be the case…?)</th>
{% endbubble %}

## Chapter 4

{% note location %}
**Location:** Okinawa Restaurant
{% endnote %}

{% img /img/es/eventstory/submarine/p1ch4.jpg %}

{% note narration %}
**Time:** Another hour or so passes — At an Okinawa restaurant
{% endnote %}

{% bubble Tetora %}
Taishou~!! Hasumi-senpai, Kanzaki-senpai! You must’ve had a long trip, so please rest for now! Ossu!

I’m so sorry that we couldn’t come see you! We didn’t have any time to spare ‘cuz we’ve been fighting with the local idols day in and out—
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori sigh %}
Actually, it’s the ES idols that have been the biggest pain… They keep harassing us over the simplest things…

But I doubt the Akatsuki members would do anything lame like that, so we should be able to take it easy, hopefully…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shinobu %}
It doesn’t feel right to call it harassment, in my opinion. I feel as though it was just bad timing on both sides—like an unfortunate accident.
{% endbubble %}

{% img /img/es/eventstory/submarine/p1ch4_1.jpg %}

{% bubble Midori awkward %}
Your soul is so pure, Shinobu-kun… I hope you stay that way forever…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora %}
Ossu, he sure is. Shinobu-kun really holds Ryuseitai’s moral values, and he's the hope of ES.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shinobu %}
Heh! And I happen to be the strongest ninja in the idol industry…☆
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kuro %}
Haha, you Ryuseitai kiddos are as energetic as ever, huh?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora awkward %}
That’s my only strong point, after all! I got bucket loads of energy in me~!

<th>*(Whispering)*</th> ……It’s only ‘cuz Morisawa-senpai returned back to being the leader again, so we’ve got a lotta time to spare now that he takes care of everything for us involving the unit.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori worried %}
<th>*(Whispering)*</th> It’s better this way, now we can relax, at least… I don’t wanna work hard…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shinobu %}
? What are you two whispering to each other about? Let me take part, too!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori sigh %}
Nu-uh… I refuse to let anything corrupt you… I’ll be the one to protect you, Shinobu-kun…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shinobu surprised %}
Why have you been acting so odd lately, Midori-kun!?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata v2 %}
hello, everyone\~! the food is ready, so please be behave and take a seat\~
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki %}
Mhm! You’re free to chat while you eat, but don’t move around too much! We can’t have any dirt falling into our food!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora worried %}
Why’re you seniors serving the table, even though we’re the ones who should be doing that?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Keito %}
Actually, why are you two the ones bringing the food in the first place, instead of the staff? Is this restaurant owned by a relative of yours?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki %}
No, not at all, I don’t even know this place! I just heard the owner is an old man with a strained back, so we figured it’s best if we carry the food over by ourselves!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata v2 %}
yes, and since there are many people at this table, it would’ve been difficult for one person to carry everything.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kuro %}
Huh, aight. You’re all such good boys as always, arent’cha? I heard a lotta harsh stuff happened to you guys, so it wouldn’t have been surprisin’ if it made one of ya snap a li’l.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora %}
Ahaha, nothing’ll change by sulking, that’s all.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki worried %}
………
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata v2 %}
alright, okaaay~ time to set up the table. temple guy, you can’t eat meat or fish, right? this salad is for you~♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Keito %}
My family isn’t that strict, actually. But sea grapes make me feel like we’re really in Okinawa, so I’m sort of happy to have some.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Souma v3 %}
Ah, Shinkai-dono—My deepest apologies, but I cannot eat fish.
{% endbubble %}

{% img /img/es/eventstory/submarine/p1ch4_2.jpg %}

{% bubble Kanata v2 %}
……!?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Souma v3 %}
Wha—!? W-Why do you look like a mother who has lost her beloved child…?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata v2 %}
souma…? what did you just say…?

you can’t eat fish? i don’t understand! you’re not the souma i know! you must be an imposter…!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki %}
Hehe, characters switching places and hero imposters are mostly just common tropes in tokusatsu, though.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata v2 %}
you, temple guy! you converted our souma to your religion, didn’t you?

you gave him a taste of delicious veggies, until his body could no longer stand the taste of fish…!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Keito %}
Don’t throw the blame on me.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Souma worried %}
Um, this has naught to do with Hasumi-dono, but rather, erm, that I—
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata v2 %}
you’re not the same anymore, are you… i’m so sad…

okinawa is a place brimming with seafood, so i was really looking forward to talking to you about all kinds of fish…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Souma worried %}
Ahh, please do not make such a somber face! This is simply an unavoidable matter—I assure you that I have not grown to hate fish…!!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Keito %}
Did we come all the way here to Okinawa to watch a pseudo-lover's quarrel happen before our very eyes?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kuro %}
Haha, it’s real nice seeing this energy, actually. It’s bringin’ me back to our Yumenosaki days.
{% endbubble %}

## Chapter 5

{% note narration %}
**Time:** A few minutes later — Akatsuki and Ryuseitai are having a discussion after their meal.
{% endnote %}

{% bubble Keito %}
Hmm, I see. I understand what’s happening in Okinawa now. Or rather, the peculiarities laid down in this prefecture.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora %}
Ossu. I’m sorry if I didn’t explain stuff very well.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Keito %}
I don’t mind. Morisawa has a tendency to see everything in a good light far more than necessary, so I wanted an impartial explanation from someone else.

Compared to him, for this reason you’re much better at explaining things than he is.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora awkward %}
Ahaha… To be honest, I still freeze up a li’l when I’m talking to you, Hasumi-senpai. I always get reminded of the time I was rejected from Akatsuki…

But well, the only reason I’m the one explaining things right now is ‘cuz Morisawa-senpai is helping Taishou get back to the ryokan, since he wasn’t feeling well.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Keito %}
Like I said, I don’t mind that. I’m tired enough as it is, Morisawa would only tire me further.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata v2 %}
hrmph… you sure do treat chiaki harshly, temple guy.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Keito %}
It’s nothing compared to *<em>you</em>.*

…Let’s get back on topic. I’d rather discuss the current situation in Okinawa than Morisawa.

We don’t know anything about what’s going on because we’ve only just arrived here.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora %}
Ossu, aight, so… Based on the official broadcasts of SS and the information circulating on HoldHands from ES—

It sounds like the atmosphere or, rather, the *<em>characteristics</em>* of the qualifying rounds are super different between regions.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shinobu %}
Indeed, it seems so. Depending on the region, you may end up trapped in a virtual space, an amusement park, a desert, a jungle, or—[^2]
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
Why are there so many variations of getting trapped inside somewhere…?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shinobu %}
Hehe, we can’t step out of Okinawa during the qualifying rounds, so in a way, you could say that we’re confined to this area too.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Keito %}
Don’t explain this situation as if we’re trapped in some sealed room for no reason. That makes it sound like a random excuse a mystery writer came up with just because they couldn’t think up a clever trick.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
I don’t even know what half those words mean…

Anyway, the region we’ve been assigned to is pretty simplistic compared to areas like the jungle or whatever—

To put it simply, it’s brutal out here.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Keito %}
Thank you for the clear expression. Specifically, there seems to be a lot of live showdowns happening around the region.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora %}
Ossu, that’s basically all you’ll ever see here.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shinobu %}
Indeed. We arrived here much earlier than Akatsuki did, but even we were challenged to a battle the moment we exited the plane.

We managed to overcome it, but we were then challenged by all sorts of idols at every opportunity right after… I’m pretty fed up with it, to tell you the truth.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Keito %}
Hm, so essentially, we’ll be challenged to a match the moment we start moving. That sounds just like Pokemon.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shinobu %}
You know about Pokemon, Hasumi-dono!?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Keito %}
Do you have a problem with that?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shinobu %}
Ah, no… But the more I talk to you, the more I realize you’re someone I could get along with!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Souma v3 %}
Haha, I would more say it is you who is affable no matter who you speak to, Sengoku.

Although, Ryuseitai is predominantly more soft-hearted compared to Akatsuki—In other words, it feels relaxing to intermingle with you. I believe that your group is remarkably unsuitable for such a ferocious atmosphere.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora %}
Mm~ Thing is, Yumenosaki was like that too, so we *<em>are</em>* familiar with it.

But Morisaw—<em>Taichou</em> doesn't like seeing people crush each other, so he wants to put an end to those conflicts.

He’s the current leader of Ryuseitai, so we’ve been basically running around with him and telling everyone to stop fighting.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Souma v3 %}
Hmm, that is just like Morisawa-dono. He is always working hard to fulfill his duty for the sake of maintaining peace.

He is an honorable man who loves peace and cherishes people. You have truly been blessed with good predecessors, Sengoku, Nagumo.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora awkward %}
………
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
<th>(That’s odd, he didn’t mention my name…)</th>

<th>(Well, to be fair, I’ve barely talked to Kanzaki-senpai before, so I would’ve been more confused if he *<em>did</em>* speak to me like we’re friends, but still…)</th>
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata v2 %}
midori? is something the matter? if you’re still hungry, would you like to eat the fish that was meant for that traitor souma, since he didn’t bother to finish his plate?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori awkward %}
No, I’m good… I only get bigger with every bite I take… and I don’t really like the sight of a dead fish’s eyes…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata v2 %}
i knew you’d say that, so i’ve prepared sliced up sashimi as an alternative~♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Souma worried %}
Wait a moment, please refrain from calling me a traitor, Shinkai-dono! This is an inevitable matter—I swear to you that my heart has always been one with the Marine Biology Club!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata v2 %}
hmph, you can’t fool me with flattery…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Keito %}
I always think this, but Shinkai really is harsh to specifically only Kanzaki, isn’t he… Ah, wait, he’s harsh to Mikejima, too—I suppose he’s much more haughty with the people he’s close to.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shinobu %}
Shinkai-dono is always kind to us, though…?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata v2 %}
fufufu, that’s because everyone in ryuseitai are good kids~♪

…you’re always being such good kids, but still don’t get rewarded with anything… it’s such a pity.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Souma v3 %}
Ahhh! Do not let such frustration build up inside of you, Shinkai-dono! Here, eat the seafood I cannot consume!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata v2 %}
the one who’s stressing me out the most is you, souma. you traitor… you deserve death for your treachery…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Souma worried %}
Uuu, I assure you that it is not what you think it is, Shinkai-dono! I… I simply…!?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Keito %}
…Quit bullying our kid so much, Shinkai.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata v2 %}
i’m not bullying anyone~ heroes never do that.
