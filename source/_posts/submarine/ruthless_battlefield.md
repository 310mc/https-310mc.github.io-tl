That’s enough!

No wrongdoer can escape their just dues! No evil shall prosper for as long as we, Ryuseitai, exist!

The evil deed you’re all committing is *violence!* The desire to shed blood and hurt one another to attain something!

You can’t allow such evil to take control of you! You all need to stop fighting each other!

Why do you think we have a mouth to speak, a heart to feel, and words to express ourselves with? It’s so you can talk it out with your foe and get along with one another!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Keito %}
Morisawa.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki %}
Oooh, Hasumi! I see Kiryu and Kanzaki-kun, too! All of Akatsuki are here, huh!?

Okinawa is filled with idols I’ve never interacted with before, so I’m relieved to see familiar faces~♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Keito %}
You can leave that aside for a moment—I’d like to know what you’re doing here.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki %}
Why, to save you all, of course!

There’s a horrible life-or-death battle occurring in Okinawa! Actually, it wouldn’t be an exaggeration to say that a *war* is breaking out!

But you guys wouldn’t have known that due to your delayed arrival, so I was worried that you fell victim to the other idols!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Keito %}
Hmm… So the people who attempted to assault us really were nothing but idols, huh.

It seems my assumption was correct. I suspected that they were regular people simply pretending to be a threat, raising their microphones up high as if they were weapons.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki %}
They may just be idols, but believe me when I say the Okinawa idol groups are immensely powerful! They’ll wipe you out if you aren’t careful!

And so, although we aren’t the strongest unit out there—as fellow brethren from the same company, we’ll assist y—
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Keito %}
That won’t be necessary.

We’ve defeated all the idols that were foolish enough to challenge us.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki %}
Woah, that quickly!? Incredible! I see your procedures are as precise and swift as usual! But if possible, I would have rather you waited for the heroes of justice to come to the rescue, y’know!?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Keito %}
We don’t need your assistance. We aren’t weaklings who’d fall prey to evil, and neither are we in a position capable of asking for help from “heroes of justice”.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki %}
No, you’re mistaken! Mutual understanding is all you need for your friendship to blossom with someone, even if they’re a god! And there’s no reason why I can’t save you since we’re friends!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Keito %}
Hmph. That is simply how *you* feel. It’s because you always take action based on your own feelings that it’s impossible for me to trust you so-called “heroes of justice”.

You all judge others based on emotions alone—Who do you think you are? A god?[^1]
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kuro %}
Yo, chill… Drop the manga refs for a sec, we need a rundown of what’s goin’ on here.

It’s frustratin’ that we’re getting caught up in this mess without even knowin’ why.

You seem to know a thing or two, Morisawa. Couldja tell us the hell’s goin’ on here?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki %}
Oooh, Kiryu! I was worried you’d be feeling unwell, but you seem to be doing alright! I’m so glad!

The boat ride must have been rough, wasn’t it? You can’t handle vehicles all too well, so I was worried that you’d feel too sick to stand!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kuro %}
Haha… Yeah, it’s actually takin’ all my effort to keep myself from droppin’ dead.

But considerin’ we accepted their challenge and all, I’m basically onstage right now as an idol.

I can’t be lookin’ all pathetic in front of all these other people, so I’m pushin’ myself through this as much as I can.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Souma %}
Haha, Hasumi-dono and I alone were sufficient enough to rout such miniscule foes.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Keito %}
Yeah, we would have taken their challenge and won it just fine even if Kiryu weren’t here. Need I remind you that we’re none other than Akatsuki?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki %}
That’s pretty terrifying… I thought you guys were more obedient lately, but you really are a combative group…

W-Well, either way! You need to know what’s going on, right? You’re probably tired from your long trip, so let’s head over to the ryokan ES booked—
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Souma %}
Hmm… Does this perchance mean that you have come to collect us? I understand well now—I could not deduce the purpose behind your actions at first, due to your verbose manner of speaking.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Keito %}
I suppose we’re the last people who should be saying that, though.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kuro %}
Actually, Morisawa, are there any tasty restaurants nearby?

Not only did I empty my stomach from all the nausea; but needin’ to perform without any breaks in between really took me out… I’m seriously all outta gas.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki %}
Yeah, you look really pale, Kiryu… I’m worried.

Alright then. We aren’t situated at a tourist hotspot, and I’m not from here either, so I don’t have any restaurants in mind, but—

I’ll try searching for something on my phone. Nagumo has been itching to see you for a while, so I’ll call over my comrades, as well.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kuro %}
Haha… I don’t really want Tetsu seein’ this side of me.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Souma %}
<th>(Hrm… Though I am not quite clear on what is happening, it appears that we have solved this matter without any problems.)</th>

<th>(However… Who *were* those *“ai-dols”* that tried to assault us? Their bloodthirsty presence reminded me of *that* “evil,” but—)</th>

<th>(Surely, that must not be the case…?)</th>
