Alright, then sign here please… Thank you.

Well then, I’ll be going now. Please order from Takamine’s Greengrocer again…♪

<th>(Whew. I think I’ve delivered everything…?)</th>

<th>(I have to check through the sale slips first. My mom’ll be so mad if I miss anyone… I *really* don’t wanna go through that.)</th>

<th>(Ermm… so we have the teishoku place[^1] in Saison Avenue, ES’s Cafe COCHI, the staff cafeteria, and… Cafe Cinnamon.)</th>[^2]

<th>(Mhm, that’s definitely all of them.)</th>

<th>(Delivering to only four places may not sound like much, but I had to carry a *lot* of vegetables to each place since they serve so many customers a day…)</th>

<th>(It used to be really easy to deliver stuff since I did all of it in the shopping district, but that started to have problems of its own…)</th>

<th>(A while back, I tried to deliver around the district, but then people started to gather around me… and it turned into a whole mess…)</th>

<th>(Life gets really annoying the more well-known you become… I don’t even *wanna* stand out…)</th>

<th>(Well, it’s not too bad though, since our shop’s thriving ‘cause of it…)</th>

<th>(I guess you’d call this a first world problem…?)</th>

<th>(Well anyway, I have to keep succeeding in as many jobs as I can, no matter what—)</th>

<th>(There’s not much I can do about this “problem” of mine, so I’ll try not to think about it for now…)</th>

Alright, what should I do now? I’ve got some free time, so… hmm…

<th>(I’ve got dance practice to go to later, and I was planning to head to it after I was done delivering—)</th>

Ah! Actually, I may as well go to Season Avenue while I can and look around for some new mascot character goods…♪

<th>(—Ahh, never mind. I just realized none of the shops are even open at this hour…)</th>

<th>(And even if I *did* find something I like, I wouldn’t be able to buy it… My allowance is really short this month… so depressing.)</th>

<th>(Actually— Isn’t it too weird how I work a huge ton as a greengrocer *and* as an idol, yet I’ve only gotten a thousand yen raise since last year…?)</th>

<th>(My mom just decided on this amount without ever letting me have a say in it, saying that it’d be enough for a second year high school student, and I just kinda went with it…)</th>

<th>(Well, on the brighter side, none of this has been affecting any of my jobs at the moment, since I’ve been using L$ for any Ryuseitai expenses, and getting money from my parents whenever I need it…)</th>

But I wish I was paid enough money to buy an extra large plushie without going broke… I really wanna be soothed…

Uuu… The more I think about everything, the more depressing it gets…

Ugh. Just think about something else for now… I need to think of somewhere I can go kill some time.

Uurmm…? There’s all kinds of places like that in ES, but I dunno, I don’t feel up for it…

<th>(Everyone’s working really hard day in and out, and I feel like that’ll make me restless… Like, I dunno, it’s not the best place to go to for relaxation…)</th>

<th>(So another place I could go to is—)</th>

…Hm, okay. It should still be cool outside right now, so I’ll have a small walk around the ES building.

I feel calm whenever I look at plants, and it won’t cost me a penny… It’s just perfect…♪

<em><th>(Breathes in and out)</th></em> Haah… phew…♪

Maybe I was right to go with this idea… The air feels so nice… I haven’t had the time to take a stroll like this lately.

But man, it feels so good that I might end up forgetting all about my lessons, and I *really* hope that doesn’t happen…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mika %}
Where’d ya gooo\~!? I’m beggin’ ya, give it baaack\~!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
Hm? I heard a voice from afar… They sounded panicked, maybe I should go help…?

<th>(Ugh, but I don’t wanna… I bet it’s gonna be yet another troublesome problem… But I think it’ll haunt me for the rest of the day if I ignore it…)</th>

<th>(Ahh, man… I used to be able to ignore every bothersome thing without a second thought…)</th>

<th>(But thanks to a certain *someone*, I now have something like a hero’s voice inside me, constantly poking me to not be that way…)</th>

<th>(I feel like his overbearing blood is consuming my body, and it makes me wanna die… It’d be a different story if it’s just learning from someone, but this is—… I really just don’t wanna be infected by *that* guy of all people.)</th>

……Ah! I’m not supposed to be thinking to myself right now—

Um, okay. *The green flame is the mark of compassion! The great nature, growing infinitely! Ryusei Green, Takamine Midori!* — Alright then.

I’m on my way to you\~ I’m not sure if I’ll be able to help, but please wait a little longer, okay\~?

{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mika %}
Oshisan turnin’ into a *dog*…? Ummm… What’re ya on ‘bout? Daikichi-kun’s obviously nothin’ but a dog, an’ people can’t turn into dogs either, so…?

Ahhh!! But at this rate, I bet he *will* get angry at me like a growlin’, menacin’ dog\~!! What do I dooo\~!?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
<th>(Huh? Did I jump to conclusions too fast…?)</th>

<th>(That’s so embarrassing… I wanna go drown myself in the sea…)</th>

Ughh… I’m sorry. Please forget what I just said…

Um, so you’re looking for Daikichi-kun? What happened…?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mika %}
Y’see… Daikichi-kun nabbed my ID ta enter the ES buildin’… an’ ya can’t enter without it, right? That’s why I’m lookin’ fer him~
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
Huh… Yeah, that’s definitely a problem. I heard that the procedure to reissue one is a real pain, and it takes forever to get a new one…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mika %}
Exactly! That’s why Oshisan warned me not ta lose it when he handed mine over ta me!

I gotta get it back, or he’ll be super mad~! Uuu, what do I dooo… He’s totally gonna give me hell fer this…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
Wha—He’d go *that* far…?

<th>(Mmm… He really sounds like he’s in trouble…)</th>

<th>(It’s gonna be physically painful to search for one dog in such a huge place, though…)</th>

<th>(But I’m sure if Morisawa-senpai were here, he’d immediately help out without a second thought…)</th>

<th>(*Sigh*… Well, I’m here now, so I can’t pretend to be a bystander, or I’ll just feel bad for the rest of the day. I guess I’ll help out until it’s time for practice…?)</th>

Um… If you don’t mind, I could help you find Daikichi-kun?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mika %}
R-Really!? Yer alright with that!?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
Yeah. I still have time before I need to go, and I was only strolling around to kill time.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mika %}
T-Thank ya kindly\~! Yer like my savior\~!

Ah— But yer part of Ryuseitai, so I reckon ‘s completely natural for ya ta help people out… Was that rude fer me ta say?

Yer just what ya’d expect from a hero of justice~♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
Ahaha… I’m not that noble of a person, y’know…?

Ryuseitai has had joint lives with Valkyrie a few times before, and we’re indebted to you, so, yeah…

I can’t sit around here and do nothing while a colleague is in trouble, that’s all…

Thanking me for something like this would only make me feel awkward, so… Please don’t worry about it.

Anyway, let’s go search for Daikichi-kun before he gets any further.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mika %}
Nnah, yer right! He dashed from the front of the ES building over t’here, so this is where I lost sight of ‘im.

Did he go far into the woods…?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
I’m looking around, and I don’t see a uh, shadow? of a dog anywhere, so… I think you might be right…

How about we try calling for his name while walking further inside…?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mika %}
Aight th—Wait! Midori-kun! Ain’t that a dog over there?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
Ah, you’re right. It looks like one.

…Ahh, it ran even further inside.

That looked like Daikichi-kun, so let’s hurry after him…!
{% endbubble %}

<div class="msr-narration">
    <p>Deeper into the forested path…</p>
</div>

{% bubble Mika %}
Daikichi-kuuun! I’m beggin’ ya, come on out~!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
You’re stressing out Kagehira-senpai! You need to return his ID~! Daikichi-kuuun!

*Sigh*… He’s really nowhere to be found, huh?

This is the first time I’ve come this far down the path. Nobody walks this far inside, huh…

Ughh… The plants are so thick, it’s kinda creepy… and there’s barely anyone around… It’s kinda scary — I’m starting to feel anxious…

Wasn’t there a huge storehouse for keeping set pieces and props around here…?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mika %}
Mhm, ‘s first time I’ve been here myself… I heard anythin’ hard ta store within the buildin’, like stuff used in photoshoots, gets stored in there.

I reckon they’ve been renovatin’ it since last week?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
Huh? Really?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mika %}
They’re gonna make it bigger or somethin’, an’ they’ll make a proper path from the back of ES for easier access ta it.

That might be why there’s barely anyone ‘round here.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
Huh… I didn’t really check up on that. That means we need to catch Daikichi-kun and get out of here as soon as possible.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mika %}
Ah! Ain’t that big buildin’ the storehouse we were talkin’ about?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
—! Did you hear that bark just now…!?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mika %}
Midori-kun! Ain’t that Daikichi-kun near the entrance ta the storehouse!?

—Ah, he’s goin’ inside. The door was left slightly open… That’s so careless of ‘em.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
Oh, but this puts luck on our side…♪ He won’t have anywhere to escape, which means we’ve got ourselves a fish in a barrel—

—Wait, that doesn’t make much sense. He’s a *dog*, not a fish… Umm, then dog in a barrel?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mika %}
Nnahh\~! Never mind that\~! We gotta get my ID before he escapes again!

I’m not lettin’ ya escape this time! Chaaarge~!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
Ah—You don’t have to run…!

Ahh, jeez! Please wait, Kagehira-senpai! Don’t leave me alone here~!

Daikichi-kun— You’re *not* getting away this time!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mika %}
Give it up an’ gimme back my—

Wawa—!? Midori-kun, don’t just stand at the door~ Couldja go in already~?

We’re both gettin’ wedged in the door~! Why’d ya charge at ‘im at the same time as me?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
U-Um, it’s just that you were yelling “charge” at him, so I…

Wai—Kagehira-senpai, don’t push me, the door is too small…!

I’m way too big, I’ll get sandwiched by the door— Stop, stop…!

Waah~!? —Gah—ow!

Owow… I crashed straight into one of the setpieces…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mika %}
Nnah! M-Midori-kun, ‘m so sorry…! I pushed ya way too hard… Did ya get hurt?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
Oh, I’m alright. I’m pretty sturdy, so…

Actually, I’m more worried about the setpiece… I’m pretty huge, so I might’ve done something to it… I dunno what I’d do if it breaks… I don’t have the money to pay for it to be fixed…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mika %}
I reckon it’s all good! I don’t see a scratch on it! It ain’t broken at a—

Mm? It’s kinda wobbly…? It keeps teeterin’ back and forth like it’s losing its balan—

Aaaaaaaah!? It’s fallin’ down~!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
AAAAAAGH?!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mika %}
…………
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
…………

<th><em>(Cough, cough…)</em></th> So much dust…

Ugh… I almost thought I died from the impact… I’m so lucky that they’re huge pieces without any real weight…

I gotta get out of here… *Huff, huff…*

There’s dust all over me… so depressing…

Ah—! What about Kagehira-senpai…!?

Aahhhh~! He’s buried inside…!

Are you alright, Kagehira-senpai!? I’ll lift the sets now, okay!?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mika %}
I-I’m alri—Achoo! Haa-choo!

Nnaah~… The dust’s makin’ my nose tingly…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
Heave-ho… I’ve got it up, so please come out of there now.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mika %}
Thank ya kindly\~♪ *Huff…* Ahhh\~ That scared me… I’m so glad it wasn’t heavy…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
Um… I’m so sorry. I ended up crashing into it because of how huge I am…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mika %}
Huh!? Why’re ya apologizin’!? It’s all my fault, y’know!?

I’m sorry for puttin’ ya in danger by pushin’ ya… I’m so glad yer alright.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
Huh? No, it’s my fault for—

Um, why do I feel like there won’t be an end to this…

Alright then, let’s consider it both our faults… Let’s be more careful from here on in. It’s really dark and messy in here, so…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mika %}
Mhm, thank ya kindly, Midori-kun~♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
Ah, those setpieces blocked the entrance… They’re all pretty light, so we’ll just need to move them out of the way.

But maybe that’s a *good* thing? Daikichi-kun has no way of escaping now.

Let’s catch him and then move them out of the way.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mika %}
Aight~ Ummm, is he all the way in the back? It’s real dark in here, so we gotta step carefully… Daikichi-kuuun?

Ah! He’s near the wall!

…Hm? Huh? I chased after ‘im here ‘cause I thought he was Daikichi-kun but… maybe I was wrong? It does look similar to ‘im, though.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
Ah, you’re right. I couldn’t tell from afar… It’s thinner than Daikichi-kun, isn’t it? So it was a different dog all along… Maybe it got lost?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mika %}
Ahh! It escaped through the little window over there!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
Mm? But it dropped what it was holding…

Isn’t that your ID over there?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mika %}
Waaah, yer right! What a relief~ Thank ya so much, really~♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
I didn’t really do anything except run around with you… I don’t think I was even useful in the end…

But I’m glad you found it…♪ Alright then, let’s go back. I should be heading for practice now, anyway—

Huh? Actually, what time is it anyway…?

<th>(Umm, let me check on my phone… Oh, my phone’s almost out of battery. Did I not plug it in correctly last night…?)</th>

<th>(Oh well. I can charge it during practice, I just need to know the time right now—)</th>

—! Ahhh!? It’s already this late!? Crap, I have to go now or I’ll be late!

Kagehira-senpai, let’s hurry back!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mika %}
Y-Yeah! Let’s get these outta the way. I’ll lift it from ‘ere, so ya should take the other side.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
Okay! Let’s do this~ One, two, three— Heave-ho…!

I think this’ll be enough for the door to open?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mika %}
Mhm. It should be—

Mm? Mmm~!?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
…? What’s wrong? I’m in a hurry, so… Could you please open the door already…?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mika %}
…M-Midori-kun. W-What do I do… The door won’t budge…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
Huh!? P-Please move aside for a moment. I’ll try opening it…!

Mmm\~! *Huff… Huff…* Mmmrgh\~!!!

…It won’t open. Maybe we’re supposed to pull it, not push…?

Nghhh~!!

Nope… It won’t budge… Why…?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mika %}
D-Did… the impact from the pieces falling lock the door by accident somehow…?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
Which means…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mika %}
We’re…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble MidoriMika %}
Trapped in hereeeeeee!?
{% endbubble %}

## Chapter 4

<div class="msr-narration">
    <p>Back to the present…</p>
</div>

{% bubble Midori %}
*Siiiighhh…* This is so depressing…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mika %}
L-L-L-Let’s just stay c-calm now, y’hear?!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
You need to calm down more than I do… Take a slow, deep breath.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mika %}
<em><th>(Breathe in, breathe out)</th>…</em>

Ahh… Yeah, it really helped me calm down a li’l…♪

Yer amazin’, Midori-kun. How’re ya so calm? An’ I’m the senior between us, too… Real pathetic of me.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
Oh, no, it’s more like… I get self-aware, I guess? I feel more calm when there’s someone else panicking.

By the way, do you have your phone on you? Could you call for help…?

I could use mine, but it’s almost dead… I don’t think it’ll survive long enough for a phone call…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mika %}
—! Ahh, yer right! We could do that! I was so panicked, it totally slipped my mind~

I’ve got mine! Gimme a sec, I’ll ask Oshisan for help! ♪

Mm? Mmm? Huh!?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
…? Kagehira-senpai, why’re you patting yourself all over?

You look like the penguin-mascot character “Pen-tagon”, it’s kinda cute…♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mika %}
…Um, Midori-kun. ‘m real, real sorry…

Y’see, I must’ve dropped my phone somewhere while runnin’ around…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
Whaaa!? You *dropped* it!?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mika %}
Nnaaaah\~! I’m so stuuupid\~! Why am I so unlucky today!? Is this meant to be the unluckiest day in my whole life…!?

Ngh, this is real pathetic of me… From now on, I’m “Kagehira Moron”! Moron, y’hear!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
Calm down… There’s no point in crying over spilled milk, so don’t be so hard on yourself, okay…?

Sometimes it’s just one of those days… When everything goes wrong no matter what you do, and you keep tripping up no matter how careful you are… I have those days too, so I know how you feel…

And anyway, I still have my phone with me, so it’s alright. I don’t know how much longer it’ll hold, but I’ll try calling for help.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mika %}
Uuu… Thank ya kindly, Midori-kun…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
<th>(Mmm… I think it’ll die while trying to call someone, so maybe I should send a message instead…?)</th>

<th>(I think they’ll be able to understand what’s going on if I send a message saying, “Kagehira-senpai is stuck with me in the set piece storehouse”…)</th>

<th>(Now it’s just deciding who to ask…)</th>

<th>(Ughh… A certain overbearing face keeps popping up… Go away.)</th>

<th>(Umm, maybe I’ll ask Tetora-kun… Ah, but he said he’s gonna be a little late to practice because he has a job to finish first.)</th>

<th>(Maybe Shinobu-kun then…? Mmm… But he mentioned something about playing around with encrypted messages—)</th>

<th>(He may think I’m just sending him one of those and end up not getting what I mean…)</th>

<th>(Then there’s Shinkai-senpai… It’s completely random if he’ll be around, which is anxiety-inducing to say the *least*…)</th>

<th>(So the last person left would be…)</th>

Ahh, dammit— Why does *he* come to mind when I’m in trouble… Is it because he’s a hero? *<th>(mumble, mumble)</th>*
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mika %}
M-Midori-kun? Why’re ya mumblin’ ta yerself while typing…? Yer face’s scarin’ me…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
Please don’t mind me. I just felt a rush of irritation well up inside me…

Umm… “Kagehira-senpai is stu—”

—Ah, crap! The battery’s gonna die! …Ahh, forget it, this’ll do! Go, send!

…aaand it’s dead. The message sent, right…?

But I couldn’t type the whole thing… Will he understand…? Actually, I wouldn’t mind if he comes over ‘cause of the message cutting off so strangely…

I can’t even manage something as simple as this… *Sigh*, I wanna die…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mika %}
—! Don’t die, Midori-kun! Yer still so young! Yer parents’ll cry fer ya if ya do~!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
Huh? Ahhh… I just have a habit of saying that… I don’t really mean it. Please don’t take it seriously…

Well, I guess it’s my own fault for constantly babbling on about depression and wanting to die…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mika %}
Oh, fer real? That’s a relief, then.

Well, ya did what ya could. We just need ta believe in ‘im and wait…♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
That’s true… You’ve really calmed down now, huh? You were so panicked earlier…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mika %}
Ahaha, yer right~ It’s like ya said; ya feel calmer when ya see another person bein’ all anxious.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
Hehe, right…?

Anyway, what’ll we do now…? Should we find a place to sit?

We can’t sit on the floor since it’s so dusty… But this is a storehouse, so there must be *something* we can sit on.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mika %}
Yeah. I see some chairs over there — let’s see if we can’t sit our butts down on ‘em.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
Ummm? Ahhh, there’s a cover over them, but we should be able to sit on one if we take it off…♪

I’m pulling the cover off… Huh. This setpiece is way too fancy, it's actually kinda weird seeing it sit in a place like this.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mika %}
Yer right. Aight, let’s wait here fer our rescue. Though we look kinda silly dilly dallyin’ while we’re trapped in ‘ere.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
Hehe, true. But I wouldn’t wanna stay in a place like this for too long, so I really do hope someone comes to our rescue soon…

<th>(Please, notice our SOS…)</th>

<th>(I don’t have *that* much hope in you, but I at least know you’re a hero who’ll come to the rescue, Morisawa-senpai…)</th>
{% endbubble %}

## Chapter 5

{% bubble Midori %}
He’s *still* not here…!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mika %}
Huh? Ain’t ya askin’ fer too much? I reckon it’s only been five minutes, y’know?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
Whaa… *Only* five…? Every minute feels like a century…

We’ve got nothing to do while we wait, so I keep having horrible thoughts, and it’s seriously depressing…

Doing something should keep my mind off all that, though…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mika %}
Yeah, I get ya. So how’s about we explore the place?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
Huh? This dirty storehouse…? I doubt there’s anything interesting, though.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mika %}
Huh, ya think? But that’s what I like about it…

Hehe, maybe I’ve gotten used ta this place?

Being surrounded by all these huge setpieces makes me feel like a little doll — it’s kinda excitin’.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
Ahhh, now that you mention it—

It’s cute how that Scandinavian house set looks like something you’d see from the Sylvanian Families.[^4]

I think my anxiety’s fading away a little just looking at it…♪

Alright, sure. There’s not much else to do here, so let’s try exploring the place.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mika %}
Aight, then how about we go deeper inside? I see a huuuge stage set from ‘ere.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
Okay.
{% endbubble %}

{% img /img/es/scoutstory/dollhouse/mikaorigcg.jpg %}

{% bubble Mika %}
…Alrightie. Look, look, Midori-kun! This set looks like a huge dollhouse, it’s so cute~

This sofa also looks great, don’t it? It would suit Madonee perfectly…♪

I wonder what show they used it for…? ——Huh? Midori-kun?

Midori-kun, ya listenin’? ‘s lonely when I’m just talking t’myself, y’know…?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
Uwaaaaaah…♪ It’s the legendary “Niku-nikumatan☆”[^5] stage set~…♪

It was a show where you did stretching exercises with this bear mascot who loves building muscle—

But Niku-nikumatan☆ immediately pulled a muscle on the first episode, and it was never aired ever again! It’s like the show was just a dream! Uwaaaah…! I can’t believe it’s right before my very eyes~☆
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mika %}
Mmm? I don’t really get how that works…?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
*Exactly!* He loves muscle building, yet he’s doing stretches on the show! And pulling a muscle during stretches makes absolutely no sense, which is just beyond perfection…!

—Um, huh?

Oh, I didn’t notice the other side because this set was hiding it, but… This looks like the restroom, huh…? There’s a kitchen, too — though it only has the basic stuff…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mika %}
Ah, yer right. Maybe they’ve got ‘em here so it’s easy to fix up setpieces while yer inside the storehouse?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
Looks like it. Guess we won’t have to worry about hurting our bladders or finding something to drink. We’re in a life-or-death situation now, so…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mika %}
There’s all kinda big setpieces here, so there’re probably more hidden places all over…

Woah! This is huge… And I don’t get what it’s s’posed to be. Whaddaya use it fer…?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
Mmm? I think this is that giant robot we had in front of the ES building for an event a while back… I think it’s the chest piece?

Morisawa-senpai went nuts over it and sent me a whole bunch of photos, so I sorta remember it…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mika %}
Ahh! *That* robot, huh?

I wouldn’t have noticed unless ya told me. I couldn’t tell by the body parts alone since it’s so huge…

Wow, we really are like toy dolls right now, ain’t we?

From a doll's perspective, stuff belonging to human beings would be so big, ‘n they wouldn’t know what it’s fer—

I reckon they’d use a sofa for a trampoline and stuff.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
Oh yeah, there was a nursery rhyme like that — where the toys come out to dance and play in the night behind the humans’ backs.[^6]
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mika %}
Mhm. I used t’sing it ta my li’l siblings back in the day.

When I was a kid, I used ta dream of stuff like, “if I could be as small as a doll, I could eat lots and lots of cakes, and live in a fancy dollhouse~”.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
Hehe, I used to think about being super tiny, too. I wanted to nap on the belly of a fluffy mascot character…♪

But in the end, I just got bigger and bigger… *Sigh,* so depressing…

Oh yeah, hasn’t enough time passed since I sent that message? I wish he’d notice the SOS and come rescue us already…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mika %}
Yeah, hmmm… I still don’t hear anybody outside, though.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
Ughh… Weren’t you supposed to be a hero to anyone in need…? You always stick your nose in my business even when I say no, so what gives…?

I know there’s that whole “a hero always arrives in the nick of time” saying, but can you *not* do that this time…?

Mm… Where on earth is Takamine? It’s already time for practice… I think his phone is dead, because I can’t call him, either.

<th>(I tried asking around, and it sounds like he was delivering vegetables early in the morning…)</th>

<th>(The manager of Cinnamon said that he finished his delivery over there, so I don’t think he’s still delivering anything…)</th>

<th>(I accidentally mentioned that I couldn’t find Takamine anywhere and made the manager worried… I feel bad.)</th>

<th>(I’ll have to let them know when I find Takamine that everything’s all right.)</th>

On the other hand, Takamine sure is hardworking! He’s been properly going to school, doing his jobs, and even helping out his family’s greengrocer!

The manager also praised him a lot, and hearing it made me feel proud~♪

But if I said any of this to him, he might get angry at me again and tell me off for treating him like a kid… But I can’t help it! I’m so happy to hear my junior getting praise and recognition!

But really, where *is* he?

I got a message from him earlier saying, “Kagehira-senpai is stu”… What on earth does it mean…?

Oh! I shouldn’t just think to myself right now.

I’ve asked the other three to start practice without the two of us, but I’m still making them wait on us either way. I’ll think about the message while looking around!

A detective’s work involves using his feet! This is just like Space Sheriff Gavan — I’m all fired up~♪

Ah, speaking of which — I’ve been curious about something…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mika %}
Hm? What’s up?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
I know this is a remote area, but isn’t it a little *too* weird how nobody has walked by here…?

If they’ve been renovating since last week, then you’d think there’d be someone around here by now…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mika %}
Hm? Ain’t that exactly why there’s nobody around?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
Huh? Haven’t they started the work since last week, though?

That would mean they’re still working on it, so shouldn’t a worker have shown up by now? Isn’t it weird that there *isn’t* anyone?

Like, I figured that even if Morisawa-senpai doesn’t come save us, we could bear it until tomorrow when a worker comes in here… Hence why I wasn’t really worried or anything…

But there really is just nobody around, huh…?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mika %}
Nnaah! No, no! Ya got it all wrong, Midori-kun!

They may have started a week ago, but the actual construction with the machines an’ all is gonna start next week!

They’re just makin’ it off-limits to be ‘ere, is all. But that’s still counted as “under construction,” y’see?

So I doubt anyone would come by ‘til next week…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
*Whaaaaaat!?* Why didn’t you tell me that earlier!?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mika %}
Nnahh, sorry fer thinkin’ ya got what I meant… I knew alla that already, so my explanation was real lackin’…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
*That’s* why you’ve been panicking this whole time!?

Uwaaaaah…!!! W-What do we doooo!? We can’t just wait for help…! We have to find a way to get out of here!

We’ll die if we wait a whole week… I can’t stand the thought of my usual phrase becoming real…

You’re asking for too much… I’m stretching as far as I can…

Also, ten centimeters isn’t just *“a little”*… Please don’t underestimate how tall that’d make a person…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mika %}
Nnaah~! The ceilin’ window strategy’s a flop after all…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
Alright then, I’ll put you down. —Here we go…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mika %}
…Phew. Ngh, it wasn’t enough… I was able ta open the window, but I can’t lift my body up ta it~

I must’ve been real heavy on yer shoulders, huh? ‘m sorry.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
It’s alright. I’m always carrying heavy boxes of vegetables, so I’m used to the weight.

But you’re pretty light anyways, so I could probably even run while carrying you on my shoulders.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mika %}
That’s good, then~

Ah! What if I stand on yer shoulders instead!? I should be able to reach then!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
Um, I’ve been thinking, but… Let’s say you did manage to get out through the window… Wouldn’t you just immediately fall to the ground…? Do you have some sort of plan?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mika %}
Umm…

Oh, yer right actually.

Ahaha, I hadn’t thought about what would happen *after* I got out~
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
Thought so…

Let’s forget about this idea. Things would only get worse if you hurt yourself.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mika %}
Aight… That’s a shame.

We can’t get out from the bottom window the dog went through, so I figured this’d be our ticket outside…

I guess this means we need t’think up somethin’ else…?

Ah! There’s a vent over there, how ‘bout that?

Y’know, like ya see in spy movies? Where ya go through the vents~
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
We can’t. It’s as high up as the window, and it’s locked with wiring. There’s no way we could get it open normally.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mika %}
That’s no good either, huh…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
Mmm… Maybe if we could drop something outside as an SOS…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mika %}
Somethin’ as an SOS…

Ah! Then how ‘bout we hang the words SOS outside the window with these here ropes?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
With rope? We don’t have scissors or tape— How are we supposed to make the letters?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mika %}
Well, y’see~ Ya link the letters like a single stroke… then ya tie it here, and—

There, if I keep doin’ this and then make it hangable, it’ll turn into an SOS sign~
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
Ohh, I get it! Wow, you really are a member of the Handicrafts club, huh?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mika %}
Hmhm\~♪ Ya can leave the thread kinda stuff ta me\~ Though this is just rope…

Aight, I reckon I could hang it up if ya lift me one more time? My hands reached the window, so it should work.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
There’s a lot of trees around here, so I dunno if anyone will notice, but… This is all we have right now. Let’s try it.
{% endbubble %}

<div class="msr-location">

{% img /img/es/scoutstory/dollhouse/6_1.jpg %}

{% bubble Chiaki %}
Mmm… He isn’t here, either…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tsumugi %}
Mmm… He isn’t here…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki %}
Hm? Did someone just say the same thing as me…?

Ohh! Aoba! Have you been looking for someone, too?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tsumugi %}
Oh, Chiaki-kun? Fancy seeing you here~ Yes, I have. You see, I spotted this on the ground earlier.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki %}
Hm? Is that a phone?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tsumugi %}
Yes. I didn’t know who it belonged to, so I had no choice but to peek in to know… It looks like it belongs to Mika-kun.

I figured he would need this back, so I’ve been looking for him, but — I can’t find him anywhere.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki %}
Oh? What a coincidence! I’m also looking for Takamine!

Oh yeah, that reminds me — Takamine’s message earlier mentioned Kagehira-kun’s name.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tsumugi %}
Message?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki %}
Takamine didn’t pick up the phone when I called him because his phone died, but before that, he managed to send me this. —Ah, here it is.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tsumugi %}
“Kagehira-senpai is stu”…? Is this all?

What a strange message… What could it mean?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki %}
I have no idea!

But my guess would be that he was trying to say “staple”!

The superhero staples are the basic foundation for all heroes of justice! Examples of them would be the storylines of Anpanman, Goranger, and Ultraman!

Ahh, but lately, tokusatsu shows are really starting to stray from those elements…

Well, never mind that.

In other words, Takamine is talking to Kagehira-kun about superhero staples, the shows that pop into your head when you think of them.

They might be playing pretend in one right now, so he wanted to message me saying he’ll be late…!

But gosh, he’s such a ditz — He sent me the message midway~☆
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tsumugi %}
Mmm… Personally, I don’t think that’s what it is…

Also, if he meant staples, wouldn’t he have said “sta”, not “stu”?[^7]
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki %}
Mm~? Huh, you’re right… Then what could this message mean…?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tsumugi %}
Who knows…? But this may mean they’re both together right now.

But honestly, it’s strange that they disappeared just like that. Did they get spirited away?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki %}
S-Spirited *away!?* No, that’s impossible! People can’t be spirited away; there's no scientific evidence of it happening, so that's why I’m definitely, absolutely *not* scared by the thought of it!!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tsumugi %}
Really? But there’s folklore for every place you go, as well as cases of it happening, so I would assume it’s likely possible…?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki %}
No, really, there’s no way it could! We should stop talking about this, okay!? If we keep this conversation going, it may actually— Nono, it won’t happen, it *won’t!!*

C’mon now, let’s talk about something fun! Something as bright as the sun! …Maybe we could talk *about* the sun?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tsumugi %}
Ahaha, that does sound nice, but we should continue our conversation after we’ve found the two.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki %}
Ah! You’re right! We should accomplish our goal first!
{% endbubble %}

## Chapter 7

<div class="msr-location">

{% img /img/es/scoutstory/dollhouse/7_1.jpg %}

{% bubble Midori %}
*Sigh*… Nothing, huh…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mika %}
Oh man… I looked ‘round the place again, but there really ain’t no other way ta get outta here.

Will we just be stuck ‘ere forever…?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
…………
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mika %}
Nobody’s gonna be comin’ to our rescue after all…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
Huh…?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mika %}
Ah! I’m only gonna make ya anxious if I keep talkin’ like this, aren’t I? ‘m real sorry!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori idle %}
No, um… By that, do you—

…No, nothing.

<th>(Did I disappoint him…?)</th>

<th>(I bet I did… There’s no way this could’ve gone well…)</th>

<th>(I mean, there’s *still* nobody coming to our rescue…)</th>

<th>(The more I grow up, the more I learn the hard truth… Nothing’s convenient in this world…)</th>

……………

<th>(Why won’t you come save us…?)</th>

<th>(Isn’t a hero supposed to *always* come to the rescue whenever there’s danger…?)</th>

<th>(I didn’t believe that at first…)</th>

<th>(But you’d always, always arrive on the scene — and you’d always, always, always, *always* be shouting as loud as you could…)</th>

<th>(And before I knew it, I started to think… maybe even *believe*, just a little, and yet—)</th>

<th>(It’s not that I thought you’d never lie, but…)</th>

<th>(I felt like… you wouldn’t *let* it be a lie. I really started to feel that way.)</th>

<th>(That was enough for me to keep working as hard as I could…)</th>

<th>(Because I didn’t wanna think that what *those* people said about us back then was true…)</th>[^8]

<th>(And I didn’t wanna let all our hard work be a complete lie…)</th>

<th>(So why…? Why won’t you come…)</th>

<th>(…No. I’m already aware… I’m just taking it out on you.)</th>

<th>(I didn’t wanna accept the truth, and it’s been making my heart race like crazy…)</th>

<th>(Because what’s really making me mad… the one who’s really pathetic right now is—)</th>

…………
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mika %}
Midori-kun? Why’re ya crouchin’…?

Ya must be real anxious… ‘m sorry. If I just didn’t run straight inta this place without a second thought, you wouldn’t be stuck here…

I’m sure someone’ll find our SOS, so don’t be so down, aight?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
…No. —That’s not it.

I’m… I’m sorry, Kagehira-senpai.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mika %}
Huh!? What’s wrong!? Why’re ya apologizin’ outta nowhere!? It’s my fault that yer here, so *I’m* the one who’s supposed ta say sorry!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
No, not that… It’s just, you’ve been thinking up so many ways to get out of here, and all I’ve done so far is reject each and every one of them…

And like, I haven’t even bothered to come up with anything on my own.

I’ve just been waiting for someone else to come save us… When *I’m* the one who’s supposed to save you…

Ryuseitai—and everyone around me, they do that all the time, yet I can barely do the same…

When we were called hypocrites and frauds… I was so angry that someone who didn’t even know a thing about us was telling us off…

But in reality, I actually can’t do *anything* — all I ever do is vent my frustrations…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mika %}
……
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
All I ever do is whine, like I’m doing now… I even told Morisawa-senpai not to show an uncool side to us, like an arrogant idiot…[^9]

But in the end, I’m the one who’s the really uncool, pathetic loser…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mika %}
Woop! <em><th>(Claps his hands as hard as he can)</th></em>
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
Eeeeek!!

Y-You surprised me…! Please don’t make a loud sound like that… The echo in this place is insane…

Also, I was being serious here, y’know…?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mika %}
Ahaha, ‘m sorry. I figured it’s best ta start with clearin’ the mood in here.

Being locked in a dark place really starts ta make ya feel like yer down in the dumps, don’t it?

I dunno how yer feeling, but—

Is it really *that* bad ta be uncool?

Would that mean that kids can’t become heroes just ‘cause they can’t do what the heroes on the screen do?

Y’see, where I used ta live… Whenever we used ta watch Super Sentai shows, all my li’l bros would start sayin’ they wanted ta be heroes.

Does that mean they *can’t* become one?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
…………
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mika %}
I don’t see it that way. They may jus’ be kids now, but… as long as they believe, hope, and do their best—

Some day, they’ll go from bein’ my li’l bros to bein’ heroes, y’know?

I don’t ever wanna reject kids who have that hope in themselves. I wanna cheer for ‘em. Just like how I was cheered on—

Y’know, ‘m sure heroes and idols are the same kinda thing.

As long as ya believe and wish fer it, yer path ta yer goal will get clearer ‘n’ clearer — but that path’ll stop short if ya don’t believe in yerself.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
…Is it really alright that I can’t do anything right now? Is it really fine to be this pathetic…?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mika %}
Even the heroes on screen don’t win every battle in a cool way, y’know?

There’ll *always* be a time when they get into trouble, get close to losin’ — and get beaten ta the ground…

But they always get right back up, and *that’s* what makes ‘em so cool. That’s just another reason why kids admire ‘em so much.

That’s why yer not even a li’l pathetic right now, Midori-kun.

Yer just workin’ yer way back up! And besides, yer savin’ me a whole bunch!

Ya helped me find my ID, and the anxiety woulda been overwhelming if I were stuck in this place all alone!

Y’know what? Nothin’ spells “hero” more than someone who isn’t even aware of just how much they’ve been savin’ people~♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
…Then please say all of that without surprising me…

Gosh… Thanks to that shock you gave me—all my moping just flew right out of me.
{% endbubble %}

## Chapter 8

{% bubble Mika %}
Aight then, let’s get back ta thinkin’ up ways ta get outta ‘ere!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
Kagehira-senpai, let’s try throwing ourselves against the door to break it open.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mika %}
Whaaa!? Where’d that insane idea come from!?

I doubt that’ll work…? I mean, it’s made outta iron…

—Wait, yer stretching already!?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
We don’t have to make a hole in the door or anything — all we need to do is bend it open a little. It should be manageable with two guys.

I mean, it would be great if we actually *did* manage to break it open — but also, someone might hear our banging at least.

Besides, it may be made out of iron, but it doesn’t seem to be that thick. Or else it would’ve been so heavy, you wouldn’t even be able to open the door.

Not only is dust going to get in our faces, but it’s also gonna hurt, and we’re gonna have to hope we don’t get injured… Honestly, I don’t actually wanna do this, but—

We’re not gonna be falling straight out a window at least, so I figured I could try my best for this.

But we’ll stop if either of us get close to an injury, okay? There’s no point in acting cool here.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mika %}
Ahaha, ya sound so much more confident now.

Aight then. Let’s try it~!
{% endbubble %}

</div>

{% bubble Chiaki %}
Uu… The woods are so quiet, it’s a little unsettling…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tsumugi %}
You’re right. And there’s renovation going on right now, so it’s even quieter than usual.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki %}
Are Takamine and Kagehira-kun really over here…?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tsumugi %}
Who knows? We checked the entire area and couldn’t find them, and this is the only place left, so maybe they’ll be here…?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki %}
Oh! There’s a large building over there! The rusted exterior makes it look so eerie…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tsumugi %}
Ahh, that’s the set piece storehouse. It’s the building they’re going to renovate.

Hm? There’s rope hanging out the window…?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki %}
Ah! You’re right!

Umm… “202”…? What does that mean?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tsumugi %}
I don’t have a clue… The first thing that comes to mind is an apartment room number…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki %}
An apartment room number? *Here?* We don’t have a room by that number in ES, either… Maybe it’s a phone number? Like the number you call in an emergency.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tsumugi %}
I don’t think there’s a telephone number for 202, though…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki %}
What a mystery… Mmm…?

—! Huh? Something’s starting to come to me when I tilt my head…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tsumugi %}
Me, too… There was a similar trick in the mystery novel I read…

If you read it diagonally… no, in the opposite direction…?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki %}
Opposite direction… “es-oh-es”…?

Ohhh! Flip it around, and it becomes “es-oh-es”!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tsumugi %}
Ah, that’s it! They call it mirrored writing~ How interesting, it’s like a visual illusion~♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble ChiakiTsumugi %}
*…SOS!?*
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki %}
W-What’s going on!? Why is there a request for help outside the storehouse!?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tsumugi %}
Chiaki-kun, about the message you received earlier…

That “stu-” part… maybe it was meant to say “stuck”?[^10]
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki %}
So that means… What Takamine wanted to say was—

*“Kagehira-kun is stuck with me in the set piece storehouse”!?*
{% endbubble %}

<div class="msr-location">

Alright then, we’ll charge on the count of three.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mika %}
Aight!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
One—
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki %}
*Takamineeeeee!!*
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tsumugi %}
Mika-kun, are you okaaaaaayyy!?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble MidoriMika %}
Gaaaaaaaaaaah!?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki %}
Are you alright!? Are either of you hurt anywhere!?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
Huh? M-Morisawa-senpai…?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mika %}
T-Tsumuchan-senpai…? Why’re ya…?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tsumugi %}
Ahh, I’m so glad you’re safe…

We were looking for you two. I found your phone, so I wanted to return it to you.

Then I spotted Chiaki-kun looking for Takamine-kun, so we tried working together.

That’s when we saw the SOS sign outside the window and rushed over to help.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mika %}
Ah! Ya found my phone!? Thank ya kindly~!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
Wait—Forget that, how’d you two unlock the door!? Did you have the key or something!?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki %}
Hm? Key? There wasn’t a lock or anything, though?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
Huh? B-But, we couldn’t open it no matter how hard we pushed or pulled…!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki %}
Ummm…? It’s a sliding door, y’know? Look—It opens when you slide it.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tsumugi %}
Hm, yeah, I don’t think pushing or pulling it would work on this door.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
Wha…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mika %}
A-Ahaha…

We were so panicked, we never considered the possibility of it bein’ a sliding door…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
…I’m depressed and wanna die. Do *not* search for me, please.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki %}
Ha ha ha!! ☆ Don’t be that way, Takamine! You two are safe, and that’s all that matters!

Don’t worry about it! We all have days when we fail — that’s what makes us human! Failures are the key to success!

If you’re a boy, then leap forth with full confidence! Jump out and reach for your future! ☆
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
Shut up. Don’t you *dare* say “failure” again.

*Sighhhhhh*… What the hell, so it was all just a big waste of time… I’m so depreeessed…

…Well, it wasn’t entirely a waste… But, still, I just… <em><th>(mumble, mumble)</th></em>
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mika %}
Ehehe, a lot happened, but ‘m glad we’re out now. Thank ya kindly, really~♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
Thank you too, Kagehira-senpai…♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tsumugi %}
Oh? I didn’t think you two would be so calm after being stuck here… Did something good happen?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mika %}
It’s a secret~ Ya gotta protect a hero’s secret~♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
<th>(This sure was a mess… Oh well. At least something good came out of it.)</th>
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki %}
Ah, I almost forgot! The other three are waiting for us in the practice room!

Takamine! Our comrades are waiting for your return! Let’s return at the speed of a shooting star!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
…………

{% bubble Chiaki %}
Hm? No response!? What’s wrong, what’s up!?

—He’ll only get more overbearing if I say that out loud, so I’ll keep it to myself.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki %}
Did you say something, Takamine?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
Nope.

Yeah, you’re right. That’s enough darkness for one day. Let’s go somewhere brighter.

[^4]: This is [Sylvanian Families](https://www.sylvanianfamilies.com/en-uk/).
[^5]: This mascot's name is a wordplay between *niku* (meat) and *kuma* (bear).
[^6]: The [nursery rhyme](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w14xl5NbKL0) he’s referring to.
[^7]: Originally, Midori only manages to send a message to Chiaki saying *Kagehira-senpai to oodo—* (The word cut off here is *oodougu souko* 大道具倉庫, for “set piece storehouse”.), but his phone died before he could finish typing the word. Chiaki misunderstood it as *oudou* 王道, hence why Tsumugi corrects his interpretation.
[^8]: A reference to what happens in the first main story. A TL;DR: Rinne falsely accuses Ryuseitai of being fake, lying, hypocritical heroes, which forced Ryuseitai to fight against Crazy:B in the Idol Royale.
[^9]: A reference to Epilogue 4 of [Motor Show](/motor_show).
[^10]: As explained in Chapter 6, originally the word that cuts off midway is *oodougu souko* (Set piece storehouse). So Tsumugi figured out that Midori was trying to mention a specific location.
