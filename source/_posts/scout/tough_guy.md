{% bubble Chiaki fist %}
Takamine! Do you like gakuran!?[^1]
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori sigh %}
What’re you on about all of a sudden…?

Also, could you please not casually come to my classroom to hang out…?

I don’t get what you’re asking about, anyway… Like, are we gonna perform a live show in gakuran or something…?

My uniform in middle school was a gakuran, so I do have it at home…

But I grew tall really quickly, so I think it’d be waaay too tight for me to wear now…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki grin %}
Is that so! That’s truly wonderful! Keep on growing just like that! Become a man large enough to reach the sun…☆
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori v2 %}
Umm, Morisawa-senpai… I don’t get what’s up with you, but I’m busy right now, so could you save it for later…?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki curious %}
Hm? What are you busy with!? If there’s anything I can help with, just let me know!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki grin %}
Aren’t we comrades in Ryuseitai, Takamine!? *All for one, and one for all!*

That’s what Ryuseitai is all about! Fuhahaha!! ☆
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori frownshake %}
He’s <em>seriously</em> suffocating…

I’m so sorry, Anzu-san… If that guy’s being a bother, I’ll tie him up, tape his mouth shut, and lock him away in that storage room over there, okay…?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki surprised0 %}
Whaaa!? You’d store me away like a room heater only used in the winter!?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki grin %}
But that’s fine with me! Being tied up and confined is exactly the sort of predicament that an ally of justice would go through…♪

Anyway, so Anzu was here too, huh!? Ossu! How are you!? The seasons changing hasn’t been making you feel ill, has it!?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori v2 %}
I <em>just</em> said you’re being suffocating… Please quit hugging people over every little thing… You’re making things awkward for Anzu-san, too…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki curious %}
Hm? Takamine, what were you doing with Anzu? Is this a drawing…?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori serious %}
Ahh…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori grin %}
She’s making me mascot character designs. I’ve asked her to make a new one every time we have a Ryuseitai performance…♪

I’m always excited to see the next design, so it’s been motivating me to work hard in my idol activities lately…♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki grin %}
Ho<em>ho</em>, that’s amazing, Anzu! You’re getting good at handling Takamine! I really struggled to manage it, y’know!

As expected of our incredible producer! ♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori blushshy2 %}
Eheheh… Anzu-san’s really good at sewing, too… So she makes me plushies whenever she can…

My bed is full of Anzu-san’s handmade plushies…♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki grin %}
Really!? My bed is full of tokusatsu goods! We’re so similar, Takamine!

We Ryuseitai are brethren of the same soul! Fuhahaha…!! ☆
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori v2 %}
Uuu, please stop pestering me already… Just what did you come here for? You mentioned something about gakuran…?

The next job we have to do in Ryuseitai is the hero show that we regularly do at the park, right…

But are we doing something school-based this time…? You never mentioned this before…?

If we’re gonna perform on some school campus, then a mascot character based on stationary… or something else that matches a school, might be a nice idea… Is it possible to make one, Anzu-san…?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori blushsquint %}
Uwaah, Anzu-san’s designs are always so cuuute…♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki surprised0 %}
Takamine! Please listen to me! Show a little more interest in me instead of the mascot character, please…!

Ooh, you’ll listen to me, Anzu? Thank you, I love you! ☆
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori frown %}
This guy is <em>such</em> a damn pain…

Morisawa-senpai, you can’t just casually hug Anzu-san… Don’t come crying to me if you get sued for inappropriate behavior, ‘kay…?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki grin %}
Heh-heh-heh! This is wonderful timing; I’d love to get your help as well, Anzu! You transferred here from a normal school, right?

In that case, your thoughts on this matter may be useful…☆

For you see, the job in question is related to appearing in a school drama! ♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori worried %}
Huh? A drama…? What’re you on about… I can’t act at all, y’know…?

Plus, Sengoku-kun would probably get really flustered, so it’s not possible for us, is it…?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki %}
Ah, no, it isn’t a job for Ryuseitai. A friend of mine mentioned that he’ll perform in a school drama.

As idols, we can also get jobs like that! He’s a supporting role, though!

I work as a stuntman, and often go to various filming locations because of it, so…

My friend asked for advice about acting and such.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori serious %}
Ahh, that’s right, you were doing stunt work… Not that I really care, but is that why you’re injured so often, Morisawa-senpai…?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki grin %}
Yep! Would you like to give it a try? It’s really fun! ☆
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori frownshake %}
No way, it sounds dangerous…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori curious %}
But Morisawa-senpai, those filming locations you go to are just for tokusatsu shows, aren’t they…? Can you really coach someone on how to act in a <em>school</em> drama…?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki %}
There are tokusatsu shows set in a school, too.

But as you’ve pointed out, I’m not really sure if I can give the right advice… I may have experience as a stuntman, but I’m no actor.

However! It’s my duty to fulfill any requests presented to me!

Plus, we may one day get a job like this, so I thought we could practice acting with all of us in Ryuseitai! ♪

That’s why I’ve come here for you! You’re fine with it, aren’t you, Takamine!? Let’s band together as one and conquer this hardship side-by-side…☆
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori sad3 %}
Ehhh, you’re just doing whatever you like… It sounds like a huge pain in the ass, so could I pass…?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki smug3 %}
Fuhaha, then I’ll throw that pass back at you!

If you don’t shoot, you won’t score! If you don’t score, you won’t be able to win! Whether it’s in basketball or in life! So, Takamine, it’s time! Show me your slam dunk…☆
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori frownshake %}
Morisawa-senpai, could you <em>please</em> stop saying whatever comes to your mind…? I don’t even get what that means… I wanna die…
