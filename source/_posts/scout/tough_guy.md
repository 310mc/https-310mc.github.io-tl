{% bubble Chiaki fist %}
Takamine! Do you like gakuran!?[^1]
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori sigh %}
What’re you on about all of a sudden…?

Also, could you please not casually come to my classroom to hang out…?

I don’t get what you’re asking about, anyway… Like, are we gonna perform a live show in gakuran or something…?

My uniform in middle school was a gakuran, so I do have it at home…

But I grew tall really quickly, so I think it’d be waaay too tight for me to wear now…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki grin %}
Is that so! That’s truly wonderful! Keep on growing just like that! Become a man large enough to reach the sun…☆
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori v2 %}
Umm, Morisawa-senpai… I don’t get what’s up with you, but I’m busy right now, so could you save it for later…?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki curious %}
Hm? What are you busy with!? If there’s anything I can help with, just let me know!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki grin %}
Aren’t we comrades in Ryuseitai, Takamine!? *All for one, and one for all!*

That’s what Ryuseitai is all about! Fuhahaha!! ☆
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori frownshake %}
He’s <em>seriously</em> suffocating…

I’m so sorry, Anzu-san… If that guy’s being a bother, I’ll tie him up, tape his mouth shut, and lock him away in that storage room over there, okay…?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki surprised0 %}
Whaaa!? You’d store me away like a room heater only used in the winter!?
{% endbubble %}

But that’s fine with me! Being tied up and confined is exactly the sort of predicament that an ally of justice would go through…♪

Anyway, so Anzu was here too, huh!? Ossu! How are you!? The seasons changing hasn’t been making you feel ill, has it!?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori v2 %}
I <em>just</em> said you’re being suffocating… Please quit clinging to people over every little thing… You’re making things awkward for Anzu-san, too…

{% bubble Chiaki curious %}
Hm? Takamine, what were you doing with Anzu? Is this a drawing…?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori serious %}
Ahh…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori grin %}
She’s making me mascot character designs. I’ve asked her to make a new one every time we have a Ryuseitai performance…♪

I’m always excited to see the next design, so it’s been motivating me to work hard in my idol activities lately…♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki grin %}
Ho<em>ho</em>, that’s amazing, Anzu! You’re getting good at handling Takamine! I really struggled to manage it, y’know!

As expected of our incredible producer! ♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori blushshy2 %}
Eheheh… Anzu-san’s really good at sewing, too… So she makes me plushies whenever she can…

My bed is full of Anzu-san’s handmade plushies…♪

{% bubble Chiaki grin %}
Really!? My bed is full of tokusatsu goods! We’re so similar, Takamine!

We Ryuseitai are brethren of the same soul! Fuhahaha…!! ☆
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori v2 %}
Uuu, please stop pestering me already… Just what did you come here for? You mentioned something about gakuran…?

The next job we have to do in Ryuseitai is the hero show that we regularly do at the park, right…

But are we doing something school-based this time…? You never mentioned this before…?

If we’re gonna perform on some school campus, then a mascot character based on stationary… or something else that matches a school, might be a nice idea… Is it possible to make one, Anzu-san…?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori blushsquint %}
Uwaah, Anzu-san’s designs are always so cuuute…♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki surprised0 %}
Takamine! Please listen to me! Show a little more interest in me instead of the mascot character, please…!

Ooh, you’ll listen to me, Anzu? Thank you, I love you! ☆
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori frown %}
This guy is <em>such</em> a damn pain…

Morisawa-senpai, you can’t just casually hug Anzu-san… Don’t come crying to me if you get sued for inappropriate behavior, ‘kay…?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki grin %}
Heh-heh-heh! This is wonderful timing; I’d love to get your help as well, Anzu! You transferred here from a normal school, right?

In that case, your thoughts on this matter may be useful…☆

For you see, the job in question is related to appearing in a school drama! ♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori worried %}
Huh? A drama…? What’re you on about… I can’t act at all, y’know…?

Plus, Sengoku-kun would probably get really flustered, so it’s not possible for us, is it…?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki %}
Ah, no, it isn’t a job for Ryuseitai. A friend of mine mentioned that he’ll perform in a school drama.

As idols, we can also get jobs like that! He’s a supporting role, though!

I work as a stuntman, and often go to various filming locations because of it, so…

My friend asked for advice about acting and such.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori serious %}
Ahh, that’s right, you were doing stunt work… Not that I really care, but is that why you’re injured so often, Morisawa-senpai…?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki grin %}
Yep! Would you like to give it a try? It’s really fun! ☆
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori frownshake %}
No way, it sounds dangerous…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori curious %}
But Morisawa-senpai, those filming locations you go to are just for tokusatsu shows, aren’t they…? Can you really coach someone on how to act in a <em>school</em> drama…?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki %}
There are tokusatsu shows set in a school, too.

But as you’ve pointed out, I’m not really sure if I can give the right advice… I may have experience as a stuntman, but I’m no actor.

However! It’s my duty to fulfill any requests presented to me!

Plus, we may one day get a job like this, so I thought we could practice acting with all of us in Ryuseitai! ♪

That’s why I’ve come here for you! You’re fine with it, aren’t you, Takamine!? Let’s band together as one and conquer this hardship side-by-side…☆
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori sad3 %}
Ehhh, you’re just doing whatever you like… It sounds like a huge pain in the ass, so could I pass…?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki smug3 %}
Fuhaha, then I’ll throw that pass back at you!

If you don’t shoot, you won’t score! If you don’t score, you won’t be able to win! Whether it’s in basketball or in life! So, Takamine, it’s time! Show me your slam dunk…☆

I dunno about Shinkai-senpai, but I’m guessing he’s gone to the beach again or something…?

That’s why I took reference from the school life mangas I borrowed from the library.

It sounds like you’re doing another time-wasti— Err, I mean troublesom—… Mmm~ you’re doing another interesting thing again, huh?

That’s precisely right!

When adversity stands before you, it’s inexcusable to withdraw from it because it’s “impossible”!

If there’s any skill you need covered, I’ll do my best to teach it as long as it’s something I can do.

Mhm! I’d be glad to rely on you! Isara can do everything, after all! ☆

{% bubble Mao frown %}
I can’t do everything~ I’m just a little dexterous, is all…

But it’s only Kiryu-senpai that’s appearing in the school drama, right? So why are you also in gakuran, Buchou?[^4]
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki fist %}
Well, we Ryuseitai were already planning to practice our acting while we’re at it… And wearing the uniform would help motivate us, right?

So Takamine and I rushed over to his home to borrow his gakuran uniforms from when he was in middle school.

That guy kept growing bigger and bigger, so he often had to buy a replacement.

That’s how we were able to find uniforms fitting of all our sizes~♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Subaru frown %}
Huh… Takamin’s got it so rough; he always has to deal with all of Chi\~chan-senpai’s ideas\~
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mao %}
Woah, Subaru, you just nonchalantly joined our convo, huh?

{% bubble Mao curious %}
Where were you, anyway? Don’t just suddenly disappear on me\~ It’s lonely, y’know\~?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Subaru %}
Sorry, sorry! I saw something sparkling outside the gym, so I wanted to go pick it up.

But Daikichi got to it before me — and you just can’t win against a dog in a race, yeah~?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mao surprised2 %}
I’ve been wanting to say this for a while, but could you <em>not</em> let Daikichi run around the school? Make sure to give him a collar and keep him at home~

Lately I’ve been seeing other dogs on campus, maybe ‘cause they’re Daikichi’s friends or something…

But it’s been a real problem for us at the Student Council; in the worst case, he might get caught and taken to the health department, y’know?[^5]

Anyway, that aside… Didn’t you have something you wanted to say to Buchou?

{% bubble Subaru %}
Nhah? Me, to Chi~chan-senpai? What was it?

Do you know, Sally~? Tell me, tell me! ♪

{% bubble Mao frown %}
How am <em>I</em> supposed to know…

Why do you forget everything after thirty minutes… How can you even survive life like that?

{% bubble Subaru %}
Nah, I don’t forget the important stuff.

Ah! I remember now. Daikichi played with your ball, Chi\~chan-senpai\~
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Subaru awkward %}
So he got it a bit dirty! Sorry about that!

Here, I tried polishing it until it was sparkly clean… But there’s still some bite marks, so if it bothers you, I’ll compensate for the ruined ball, okay?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Subaru sigh %}
I seriously don’t like the idea of paying Chi~chan-senpai any money, though.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki curious %}
Mm? I don’t really mind; it isn’t like it can’t be used as a ball anymore, right?

{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki smilesoft2 %}
That’s why I want to help him however I can.

{% bubble Mao curious %}
Huh… I’m just curious, but what sort of relationship do you and Kiryu-senpai have, Buchou?

{% bubble Subaru %}
You two are at extreme ends of a spectrum, like, one’s an ally of justice and the other’s a delinquent. It’s a pretty unexpected combo~

Ah, but I’m aware Kiryu-senpai’s a good person, really!

{% bubble Chiaki fist %}
Mm. He helped me out quite a bit in the past. It’s thanks to him that I was able to become stronger.

## We, the Rough and Tough 4

{% bubble Chiaki %}
Anyhow, I don’t mean to interrupt your club activities, but… If you guys don’t mind, could you help coach Kiryu with his acting?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mao %}
It’s no problem, really. Kiryu-senpai and the Vice Prez have both helped me out a lot before.

I only came to the club to take a breather from work by playing a bit.

Ahh… That’s right, Trickstar is hard at work preparing for the SS happening at the end of the year, right?

Wooah, Chi\~chan-senpai of all people is being considerate\~♪ Didn’t Sally\~ say it’s not a problem? It sounds fun, anyway.

What should we do?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki grin %}
Mm, thank you. I’ve really got such wonderful juniors.

Hmm, well… I also asked Anzu for help with this, but — I’d like you to judge his acting.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki sad %}
You see, Nagumo and I are too close to Kiryu to give an impartial evaluation, and Takamine seems afraid of Kiryu, so he can’t even look him straight in the eye.

We need someone to judge the good and bad of his acting, from an objective and clear standpoint. He won’t be able to improve without having the flaws pointed out to him.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki serious %}
Anzu seems to struggle to express her own thoughts, though, so… We need more people to judge.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Subaru %}
Ahh… She started off as a novice, so she’s got the habit of listening to other people’s comments first for judgement and observation, huh?

Even though she’s an incredible producer by now.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mao %}
I think so, too, but I guess it’s different what guys and girls focus on when it comes to acting…

And if we just have to give our thoughts, that’s not much of a burden… So I’d be glad to help.

I think it’s a great idea. With more judges, there won’t be a biased opinion.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mao awkward %}
That being said, we’re not really that experienced with acting or anything.

So please don’t expect too much from us~

If only Hokuto was here~… He’s in the Theater Club, so he probably would’ve been able to give some good advice.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki fist %}
I see. Knowing you’ll take on the role really reassures me.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki smilesoft2 %}
Isara excels on an outstanding level as an idol, yet that doesn’t make him forget how an ordinary person perceives the world. It’s a pretty balanced, rare trait.

As for Akehoshi, he can only judge things based on whether they sparkle or not, but his instincts are usually right.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki nod %}
That natural disposition of his is an irreplaceable talent.

I believe you two are the most suitable as judges.

Mm? What’s wrong, Isara? Why’re you staring at me?

Heheh… You’ll burn if you fall for me, y’know?

Ah, no… I was just thinking — You’re actually really observant of others, Buchou.

Fuhaha! ☆ That’s what a club captain — What a leader… No! What an *ally of justice* is all about…!

{% bubble Chiaki grin %}
Ahaha. I’m the last person to say this, but — it gets pretty lively when Anzu’s here, huh?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki northinking %}
However, Anzu… You were pretty late; did something happen?

I assume you helped everyone with their change of clothes, but gakuran is pretty easy to wear, isn’t it?

Hmm… As we had expected, there weren’t any gakuran uniforms that fit Kiryu, so the two of you tried to adjust one to his size?

I accidentally put a lot of unnecessary burden on you two… We could’ve opted for our PE uniform since we’re only practicing today.

{% bubble Chiaki curious %}
Ooh… Kiryu surprisingly looks good in a gakuran, huh?

{% bubble Kuro curious %}
That so? Well, school uniforms look good on just about anyone.

But I had to rush to fix this up, so it’s still a li’l hard to move in.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki fist %}
Mm. Still, wearing the uniform will surely boost your confidence while acting.

{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kuro nod2 %}
Yeah? You always look like you’re enjoyin’ yourself — I’m kinda envious of ya. I’m not poking fun at you here; I’m pretty serious when I say that.

At first, I felt like a school drama wasn’t real fitting for someone like me at all, but I’m starting to feel a li’l more confident about the whole thing.

It seriously looks great on you, Taisho! You look so cool, I’m in awe~♪

{% bubble Kuro awkward %}
Thanks, Tetsu. Haha, this feels weird somehow.

Y’see, when I was in middle school, all I’d do was skip class and cause trouble. Then I came to this place, and well, Yumenosaki ain’t really your regular high school, so…

I had no clue what a school drama’d be like… But now that I’m wearing the same uniform as you guys and standing side-by-side…

It makes me wonder if this is a sorta youth I coulda had.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kuro nod2 %}
Having a peaceful, great time with friends of common interests… That sorta thing doesn’t sound so bad, either.

Anyways. The director of the school drama said I fit the image perfectly, apparently…

That’s why he requested me to appear in it.

I’m real happy he took note of me, so I wanna show my absolute best in return.

I’ll go slow and steady, but swift and thorough! Nagumo Tetora’s gonna head off now! ☆
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki grin %}
Take care! Watch your step so you don’t trip and fall, alright~?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki frown %}
That Nagumo… He gladly listens to everything Kiryu says, huh…

Why does he always respond to what I tell him with an “Ehh~?”… Is there a difference in our natural virtue?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki grin %}
Oh well. That aside, let’s try to memorize the script until Nagumo’s back.

There are no stage directions, so I suppose we’ll have to think up the actions on our own. Hmm, hmm~?
{% endbubble %}

{% img /img/es/scoutstory/toughguy/6_2.jpg %}

{% bubble Midori grin %}
Ahaha… Us huddling around the script and reading it together almost feels like we’ll <em>all</em> be appearing in the school drama…

Maybe this is a little fun, actually…♪

Well, only Kiryu-senpai is gonna appear though, yeah…?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kuro norsmile %}
Hm. If you wanna appear in it too, I’ll ask the director for ya. I think they were lookin’ for extras, anyway.

Plus, I’d feel at ease havin’ another person to perform with.

You’ve got good looks, so you may just land a role, y’know?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori worried %}
Eep—… No, um… Nobody mentioned anything about wanting to appear, so, err…?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kuro grin %}
Haha. This guy’s similar to how Morisawa was in the past.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki surprised %}
I-Is that so?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki awkward %}
No— Erm, yeah, it’s exactly as Takamine said! This is so much fun; it’s like we’re practicing for a school festival play! This is just another part of youth, don’t you think!? Fuhahahaha…!! ☆
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori shocked %}
Um, hold on… What was that about me being similar to how Morisawa-senpai used to be…? I’d like to sue for defamation based on what that means…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kuro norsmile %}
Ahh… My bad, I misspoke. Forget what I said. I’m sure Morisawa’d much rather look cool in front of his juniors.
{% endbubble %}

## We, the Rough and Tough 7

{% bubble Chiaki smileconfident %}
Aaalright! Let’s begin our rehearsal! I’ll go first!

I’ve basically memorized the script! In the meantime, until Nagumo is back, the rest of you are free to look through my copy…♪

Now, let’s get this started!

“Ossu! I’m Morisawa Chiaki! I’m a cheerleader who always strives to lift the spirits of everyone in Yumenosaki Academy!”…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki surprised %}
Huh!? I’m a cheerleader?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kuro glare %}
Don’t switch out now, you gotta keep acting. I forgot to mention this earlier, but it seems like the school drama is themed around a Japanese cheering squad.[^6]

And our gakuran suits that image, yeah?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kuro frown %}
But we ran out of material, so I could only make the outfits for me and Morisawa look like a legit cheering squad’s.[^7]

I wanted to be way more particular with the details, but oh well… This is just practice anyway.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki northinking %}
Ahh… True, we do look like a cheering squad.

Very well then, I’ll get back to acting!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki fist %}
“Go go, let’s go\~! Go go, let’s go\~! I’m cheering for you! Let’s work hard together…☆”
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori curious %}
Ooh… Morisawa-senpai’s pretty good at this…?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kuro norsmile %}
Yeah, Morisawa suits the role of a cheering squad member to a T.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kuro smilesoft2 %}
He’s already got a bit of experience in actin’, even if it’s mostly when it comes to stunts. He’s pretty skilled at this stuff.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki scold %}
“Mm—!? Who’s there!? Blasted villain — How dare you disturb the peace of our school! I’ll be the one to take you down!”
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki grin %}
“Woosh— *Transform!* Cheerleader Red…☆”
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori surprised %}
He transformed!? Huh!? What kinda school drama <em>is</em> this…?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Subaru scold %}
Hold on, Chi~chan-senpai! That’s not in the script! Don’t ad-lib!

Sure, it might please your fans, but you’ll only be seen as a nuisance if you added any lines out of nowhere during the real thing!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mao yare %}
Also, your movements are <em>way</em> too flashy. Wasn’t Kiryu-senpai requested to appear for a supporting role?

What’s the point of standing out more than the lead? You’ll be fired if you don’t read the room properly, y’know~?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki surprised0 %}
Guuh—! You’re all so strict with your criticism…!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki grin %}
No matter! I thank you all for your valuable comments!

You’re up next, Takamine! It’s time you try it out…☆
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori shocked %}
Eh? Uuu…? B-But I’m not mentally prepared…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kuro norsmile %}
You can do this. You’re a man, aren’tcha? Show us what you’ve got.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori sad4 %}
Uuu, ermm… Then I guess I’ll do my best somehow…?

“O-Ossu.”

“I-I’m Morisawa— Wait, I mean, Takamine Midori… Can I go home now…?”
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki surprised0 %}
You don’t sound enthusiastic at all, cheerleader!?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki grin %}
Come on, cheerleader! You’ve got this…☆
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kuro yare %}
Why’re you cheerin’ on the cheerleader, Morisawa?

……Acting really is tricky to get down, huh?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori worried %}
U-Uu… Yeah… And even though I know all the judges, I’m really nervous… All my lines flew out of my head…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora %}
I’m baaack~! ☆ Ooh, you started practicing already?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kuro norsmile %}
Great work, Tetsu. That was pretty fast, huh?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora nod %}
Ossu! Sengoku-kun taught me a secret path through the school the other day~ It really comes in handy whenever I’m almost late for class! ♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kuro norsmile %}
Yeah? Well, anyway, I’ve barely memorized the script, so — Tetsu, couldja try actin’ before me?

I’m pretty bad at using my head. I’m always leaving the thinking to Hasumi, y’see.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora %}
Ossu! This rehearsal is all for Taisho’s sake, so I want you to take your sweet time tackling this~♪

I think I’ll be able to memorize all’a these lines instantly, though. The whole thing’s only a page-long.

But well, that’s just ‘cuz there wasn’t enough time to write a full script.
{% endbubble %}

## We, the Rough and Tough 8

{% bubble Tetora curious %}
…Hmm, lemme see~

Aight, I think I’ve memorized it! I’ll give it a shot~♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora fist %}
“Ossu! ‘Sup, I’m Nagumo Tetora! I’m a cheerleader who always strives to lift the spirits of everyone in Yumenosaki Academy! ☆”
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kuro curious %}
Hold on. You don’t need to add “‘sup” in there.[^8] Can’t you speak as you’re meant to?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora surprised %}
Hweh? Ah—! I’m real sorry! That was unintentional; it just happened on its own!

Yeah, you’re right— I shouldn’t ignore how my character is written in the script; that’d be rude to the person behind the script! I’m so sorry, Anzu-Anego!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kuro serious %}
Well, I don’t think you’d offend her with that small mistake. But just keep in mind that dependin’ on the client, it might make ‘em angry, yeah?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki frown %}
I know how you feel, Nagumo. I also tend to say and do odd things without meaning to.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki cry2 %}
Whenever there’s a photoshoot, I often get scolded and told, “Quit doing transformation poses! Your arms and legs are so loud!” — But it’s completely unintentional! Believe me!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori worried %}
So Morisawa-senpai’s mouth isn’t the only thing that’s loud, even his arms and legs are…

Doesn’t Sengoku-kun sometimes accidentally sing in a ninja-like way too, and then blush in embarrassment over it…?[^9]
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori sad %}
Is this a common thing in Ryuseitai or something… Well, I guess I’m not one to talk, considering I complain about how much I wanna die whenever my mind wanders…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora angry %}
Mm~ This is tricky. It’s chill for us since we aren’t actually gonna perform in the drama…

But Taisho’s got an actual acting job to do, yeah…?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kuro v2 %}
Yeah, it’s pretty nerve-wracking. I’m doin’ this for a paid job, so it’s a huge responsibility.

That’s why I gotta practice as much as I can ‘til I properly learn how to act. It’d be shameful of me if I can’t show the fruits of all your efforts to help me out.

Right, I’m gonna try actin’ now. Watch me closely and give me your thoughts.

…………
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora blushsquint %}
<th>(Ooh… Taisho’s got such a powerful aura! I kinda feel like he shouldn’t give off such blood-thirsty energy for a school drama, but he’s just so <em>cool</em>…☆)</th>

<th>(Just the sight of him standing silently is jaw-dropping~ I expect nothin’ less from Taisho!)</th>

<th>(Taisho’s so perfect as he is, that it almost feels unnecessary to make him act as a different character! He’s awesome…☆)</th>

<th>(Makes me wonder if the school drama director also thought highly ‘bout this part of Taisho…♪)</th>

………..
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora curious %}
……Taisho? You gotta start acting out your scene at some point, y’know~?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kuro v2 %}
Mm? Uh, I’m actin’ right now, though… You can’t hear my lines? Maybe I gotta say ‘em louder?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora surprised %}
Huh? I didn’t hear anything… I don’t think you even acted your part, as in like, you’ve just been standing there…?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kuro frown %}
Ah~h… Yeah, this is pretty hard.

If I try to say my line, my body freezes, but if I try to move, there’s no force in my voice. It doesn’t help that my voice ain’t loud in the first place.

I gotta be fired up and let out my voice, or it won’t be heard well when we finally shoot the scene. Uhhh…

“Ossu. I’m Kiryu Kuro, the chief of the Karate Club.”
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora surprised %}
Huhh!? I mean, yeah, Taisho’s the chief of the Karate Club, but!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora frown %}
In the script, we’re meant to be cheerleaders, right…?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kuro srsthinking %}
Ahh, right. Uhhh… Huh? I forgot everythin’ from the script.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora surprised %}
That was too fast! You forgot <em>way</em> too fast, Taisho!?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kuro sad %}
Ugh~… I remember how I’m supposed to act. I think.

Like this, right? I’m doin’ it, yeah?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora %}
Those’re straight punches, Taisho![^10] It’s mesmerizing to watch~
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora frown %}
But that doesn’t have anythin’ to do with cheering squads, y’know~?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kuro srsthinking %}
Mm~? If I’m movin’ my body while trynna remember my lines, I get distracted and start doin’ karate <em>katas</em> from muscle memory.

Damn, acting really is tough…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki scold %}
Hm. This is a harder adversity than expected, huh…?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki grin %}
But the more difficult the mission, the more it fires me up! This is starting to get even more fun~ Fuhahahaha! ☆
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Subaru %}
…What do you think, Sally~?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mao awkward %}
Mm~… Well, I guess everyone’s got something they’re not cut out for, don’t they?
