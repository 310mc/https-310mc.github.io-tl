{% bubble Chiaki fist %}
Takamine! Do you like gakuran!?[^1]
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori sigh %}
What’re you on about all of a sudden…?

Also, could you please not casually come to my classroom to hang out…?

I don’t get what you’re asking about, anyway… Like, are we gonna perform a live show in gakuran or something…?

My uniform in middle school was a gakuran, so I do have it at home…

But I grew tall really quickly, so I think it’d be waaay too tight for me to wear now…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki grin %}
Is that so! That’s truly wonderful! Keep on growing just like that! Become a man large enough to reach the sun…☆
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori v2 %}
Umm, Morisawa-senpai… I don’t get what’s up with you, but I’m busy right now, so could you save it for later…?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki curious %}
Hm? What are you busy with!? If there’s anything I can help with, just let me know!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki grin %}
Aren’t we comrades in Ryuseitai, Takamine!? *All for one, and one for all!*

That’s what Ryuseitai is all about! Fuhahaha!! ☆
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori frownshake %}
He’s <em>seriously</em> suffocating…

I’m so sorry, Anzu-san… If that guy’s being a bother, I’ll tie him up, tape his mouth shut, and lock him away in that storage room over there, okay…?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki surprised0 %}
Whaaa!? You’d store me away like a room heater only used in the winter!?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki grin %}
But that’s fine with me! Being tied up and confined is exactly the sort of predicament that an ally of justice would go through…♪

Anyway, so Anzu was here too, huh!? Ossu! How are you!? The seasons changing hasn’t been making you feel ill, has it!?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori v2 %}
I <em>just</em> said you’re being suffocating… Please quit hugging people over every little thing… You’re making things awkward for Anzu-san, too…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki curious %}
Hm? Takamine, what were you doing with Anzu? Is this a drawing…?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori serious %}
Ahh…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori grin %}
She’s making me mascot character designs. I’ve asked her to make a new one every time we have a Ryuseitai performance…♪

I’m always excited to see the next design, so it’s been motivating me to work hard in my idol activities lately…♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki grin %}
Ho<em>ho</em>, that’s amazing, Anzu! You’re getting good at handling Takamine! I really struggled to manage it, y’know!

As expected of our incredible producer! ♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori blushshy2 %}
Eheheh… Anzu-san’s really good at sewing, too… So she makes me plushies whenever she can…

My bed is full of Anzu-san’s handmade plushies…♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki grin %}
Really!? My bed is full of tokusatsu goods! We’re so similar, Takamine!

We Ryuseitai are brethren of the same soul! Fuhahaha…!! ☆
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori v2 %}
Uuu, please stop pestering me already… Just what did you come here for? You mentioned something about gakuran…?

The next job we have to do in Ryuseitai is the hero show that we regularly do at the park, right…

But are we doing something school-based this time…? You never mentioned this before…?

If we’re gonna perform on some school campus, then a mascot character based on stationary… or something else that matches a school, might be a nice idea… Is it possible to make one, Anzu-san…?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori blushsquint %}
Uwaah, Anzu-san’s designs are always so cuuute…♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki surprised0 %}
Takamine! Please listen to me! Show a little more interest in me instead of the mascot character, please…!

Ooh, you’ll listen to me, Anzu? Thank you, I love you! ☆
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori frown %}
This guy is <em>such</em> a damn pain…

Morisawa-senpai, you can’t just casually hug Anzu-san… Don’t come crying to me if you get sued for inappropriate behavior, ‘kay…?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki grin %}
Heh-heh-heh! This is wonderful timing; I’d love to get your help as well, Anzu! You transferred here from a normal school, right?

In that case, your thoughts on this matter may be useful…☆

For you see, the job in question is related to appearing in a school drama! ♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori worried %}
Huh? A drama…? What’re you on about… I can’t act at all, y’know…?

Plus, Sengoku-kun would probably get really flustered, so it’s not possible for us, is it…?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki %}
Ah, no, it isn’t a job for Ryuseitai. A friend of mine mentioned that he’ll perform in a school drama.

As idols, we can also get jobs like that! He’s a supporting role, though!

I work as a stuntman, and often go to various filming locations because of it, so…

My friend asked for advice about acting and such.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori serious %}
Ahh, that’s right, you were doing stunt work… Not that I really care, but is that why you’re injured so often, Morisawa-senpai…?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki grin %}
Yep! Would you like to give it a try? It’s really fun! ☆
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori frownshake %}
No way, it sounds dangerous…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori curious %}
But Morisawa-senpai, those filming locations you go to are just for tokusatsu shows, aren’t they…? Can you really coach someone on how to act in a <em>school</em> drama…?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki %}
There are tokusatsu shows set in a school, too.[^]

But as you’ve pointed out, I’m not really sure if I can give the right advice… I may have experience as a stuntman, but I’m no actor.

However! It’s my duty to fulfill any requests presented to me!

Plus, we may one day get a job like this, so I thought we could practice acting with all of us in Ryuseitai! ♪

That’s why I’ve come here for you! You’re fine with it, aren’t you, Takamine!? Let’s band together as one and conquer this hardship side-by-side…☆
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori sad3 %}
Ehhh, you’re just doing whatever you like… It sounds like a huge pain in the ass, so could I pass…?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki smug3 %}
Fuhaha, then I’ll throw that pass back at you!

If you don’t shoot, you won’t score! If you don’t score, you won’t be able to win! Whether it’s in basketball or in life! So, Takamine, it’s time! Show me your slam dunk…☆
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori frownshake %}
Morisawa-senpai, could you <em>please</em> stop saying whatever comes to your mind…? I don’t even get what that means… I wanna die…
{% endbubble %}

## We, the Rough and Tough 2

{% bubble Chiaki curious %}
Anyway, where are the rest of us? Nagumo is already with the friend I mentioned, Kiryu… but what about Sengoku and Kanata?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori curious %}
Mm~… I think Sengoku-kun was asked by a Student Council member to do some work, so he’s busy…

I dunno about Shinkai-senpai, but I’m guessing he’s gone to the beach again or something…?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki grin %}
I see! How nice, everyone’s busying themselves with something! That’s what youth is all about…☆

We should go off and live our lives with full vigor too, Takamine! First things first, let’s make this mission a success! Let’s rush on over with our heads held high…☆
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori worried %}
Woah— Please don’t drag me over with you by force…

I’m used to it by now, so I’m fine with it, but… It’ll be a bother to Anzu-san, y’know…?

…Haaah—!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki surprised0 %}
Dwoph—!? W-What’re you doing all of a sudden!? <em>(Cough, cough)</em>… Don’t tackle someone as soon as you see them!

That was so forceful, it felt like a traffic accident…! I thought I was going to die, y’know…!?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kuro v2 %}
Mm~… My bad, Morisawa. I was actin’ out one of those “cliche school drama scenes” based on Tetsu’s advice.
{% endbubble %}

{% img /img/es/scoutstory/toughguy/2_2.jpg %}

{% bubble Tetora fist %}
Kuuuh\~! That was awesome, Taishou![^] It was so exhilarating to watch\~!! That’s totally how it is in school dramas!

Running with toast in your mouth while saying “I’m gonna be late~♪” is a classic trope…☆
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kuro curious %}
That so? But I feel like somethin’s off, like we’re strayin’ from it…?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora %}
Woah, don’t stop now, Taishou! After crashing into him, you gotta straddle him! That’s how it goes…☆
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kuro v2 %}
Hm, I see. So I keep my position on top of him and beat him up, huh…?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki surprised0 %}
H-Hold on, stop right there! Let’s talk this out! Don’t you know that violence solves nothing…!?

Hey, Nagumo! What’s the meaning of this!?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki grin %}
*A-ha!* I get it now; you’re trying to get rid of me and become the commander of Ryuseitai, aren’t you!?

That’s the spirit! Fuhaha! That’s the way boys ought to be…☆
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora surprised %}
Uh, no, I’m not trynna do that at all.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora sigh2 %}
Sorry, Taichou.[^] I tried to rake up my brain with anythin’ I know of school dramas, and give advice to Taishou…

But I don’t watch dramas at all, so I don’t really know how it goes.

That’s why I took reference from the school life mangas I borrowed from the library.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki grin %}
Ho*ho!* How admirable, Nagumo!

But rather than a school drama, this is what you’d do in a mixed martial arts match! How did you manage to confuse the two for each other!? You’re such a clutz, Nagumo…☆
{% endbubble %}

{% img /img/es/scoutstory/toughguy/2_3.jpg %}

{% bubble Midori curious %}
Umm, Tetora-kun… What’s this whole ruckus about…?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora %}
Ah, Midori-kun! And Anzu-Anego, too! ‘Suuup, I hope you’re doing well! Thanks for coming all the way here — You’re here to help guide Taishou, right!?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori frownshake %}
No, Morisawa-senpai just forcibly dragged me here…

Umm… So that’s the person who’s gonna appear in a school drama…?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kuro v2 %}
Yo, thanks for always supportin’ Tetsu. I’m the chief of the Karate Club, Kiryu Kuro.

Sorry for dragging you into somethin’ so troublesome. Umm, li’l miss Anzu and…?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori serious %}
Ah— Um, hello… I’m Takamine, from Ryuseitai…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kuro v2 %}
Nice ta meet’cha. …You’re pretty well-built. And you’re a *first year?* Huh, you do martial arts or somethin’?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori worried %}
Um, no, erm…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori sad %}
I’m sorry…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora frown %}
Taishou~ Midori-kun’s pretty delicate, so you can’t pressure him like that!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kuro norsmile %}
Ah, that so? Sorry for scarin’ ya; I was born with this face, y’see… But you’re a friend of Tetsu’s, so that means you’re an important guest here. Make yourself at home.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori sad4 %}
Ah…Uu… Okay. I’m so sorry…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora nod %}
You don’t have to be so scared, Midori-kun~ Taishou’s real kind, trust me! ♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kuro norsmile %}
Haha. I’m not that kind or anythin’. But I don’t throw hands with honorable people, so you can rest at ease.

Anyways, sit wherever you want over on that side — You too, li’l miss Anzu.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kuro glare %}
And you too, Morisawa. What’re you still laying on the floor for? You gotta look dignified in front of your juniors, man.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki surprised0 %}
Erm, I can’t move after you slammed into me with so much force, though…?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki frownshake %}
Sorry, Kiryu. I looked all around, but these are the only people I could gather for you.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kuro v2 %}
Well, this ain’t somethin’ that’ll be fixed with more people, so it’s fine. If anything, knowing you did as best as you could for someone like me…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kuro smilesoft2 %}
It makes me feel so grateful, I could almost cry. ♪

I’m guessing Morisawa didn’t explain anythin’ to ya. Hmm, what to do… We don’t allow food in the dojo…

I’ll go change my clothes, so how about we settle down and talk somewhere where we can eat and drink?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kuro awkward %}
I’m honestly at a loss with what to do. I can’t think of any way to get through this on my own. So please, couldja all hear me out a li’l?

{% img /img/es/scoutstory/toughguy/3_1.jpg %}

{% bubble Mao northinking %}
Ohh~ You’re going to guide Kiryu-senpai’s acting?

It sounds like you’re doing another time-wasti— Err, I mean troublesom—… Mmm~ you’re doing another interesting thing again, huh?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki grin %}
That’s precisely right!

When adversity stands before you, it’s inexcusable to withdraw from it because it’s “impossible”!

Overcoming any and all predicaments is what makes a hero! Fuhahaha…! ☆
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mao smilesoft2 %}
Ahh, I sort of get what you’re trying to say. It’s better to expand what you can do, right?

If there’s any skill you need covered, I’ll do my best to teach it as long as it’s something I can do.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki grin %}
Mhm! I’d be glad to rely on you! Isara can do everything, after all! ☆
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mao frown %}
I can’t do everything~ I’m just a little dexterous, is all…

But it’s only Kiryu-senpai that’s appearing in the school drama, right? So why are you also in gakuran, Buchou?[^]
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki fist %}
Well, we Ryuseitai were already planning to practice our acting while we’re at it… And wearing the uniform would help motivate us, right?

So Takamine and I rushed over to his home to borrow his gakuran uniforms from when he was in middle school.

That guy kept growing bigger and bigger, so he often had to buy a replacement.

That’s how we were able to find uniforms fitting of all our sizes~♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Subaru frown %}
Huh… Takamin’s got it so rough; he always has to deal with all of Chi\~chan-senpai’s ideas\~
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mao %}
Woah, Subaru, you just nonchalantly joined our convo, huh?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mao curious %}
Where were you, anyway? Don’t just suddenly disappear on me\~ It’s lonely, y’know\~?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Subaru %}
Sorry, sorry! I saw something sparkling outside the gym, so I wanted to go pick it up.

But Daikichi got to it before me — and you just can’t win against a dog in a race, yeah~?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mao surprised2 %}
I’ve been wanting to say this for a while, but could you <em>not</em> let Daikichi run around the school? Make sure to give him a collar and keep him at home~

Lately I’ve been seeing other dogs on campus, maybe ‘cause they’re Daikichi’s friends or something…

But it’s been a real problem for us at the Student Council; in the worst case, he might get caught and taken to the animal care center, y’know?[^]

Anyway, that aside… Didn’t you have something you wanted to say to Buchou?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Subaru %}
Nhah? Me, to Chi~chan-senpai? What was it?

Do you know, Sally~? Tell me, tell me! ♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mao frown %}
How am <em>I</em> supposed to know…

Why do you forget everything after thirty minutes… How can you even survive life like that?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Subaru %}
Nah, I don’t forget the important stuff.

Ah! I remember now. Daikichi played with your ball, Chi\~chan-senpai\~
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Subaru awkward %}
So he got it a bit dirty! Sorry about that!

Here, I tried polishing it until it was sparkly clean… But there’s still some bite marks, so if it bothers you, I’ll compensate for the ruined ball, okay?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Subaru sigh %}
I seriously don’t like the idea of paying Chi~chan-senpai any money, though.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki curious %}
Mm? I don’t really mind; it isn’t like it can’t be used as a ball anymore, right?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki grin %}
If anything, wounds are medals! Ah, you’ve become so manly, my sweet ball! Theeere, there, there~♪
{% endbubble %}

{% img /img/es/scoutstory/toughguy/chiakiorigcg.jpg %}

{% bubble Subaru scold %}
Ahh~! Don’t touch it! I put so much effort into shining that ball sparkly clean! You’ll get your fingerprints all over it!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki smug2 %}
It’s <em>my</em> ball. It’s up to me whether I want to touch it, hug it, or eat it! Spin, spin~♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki norsmile %}
Anyway, that’s why I couldn’t show up to the club today. Sorry, you two.

You see, I owe Kiryu for something in the past… He has my utmost gratitude for it, so I’m really touched that he’s relying on me this time.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki smilesoft2 %}
That’s why I want to help him however I can.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mao curious %}
Huh… I’m just curious, but what sort of relationship do you and Kiryu-senpai have, Buchou?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Subaru %}
You two are at extreme ends of a spectrum, like, one’s an ally of justice and the other’s a delinquent. It’s a pretty unexpected combo~

Ah, but I’m aware Kiryu-senpai’s a good person, really!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki fist %}
Mm. He helped me out quite a bit in the past. It’s thanks to him that I was able to become stronger.
{% endbubble %}

## We, the Rough and Tough 4

{% bubble Chiaki %}
Anyhow, I don’t mean to interrupt your club activities, but… If you guys don’t mind, could you help coach Kiryu with his acting?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mao %}
It’s no problem, really. Kiryu-senpai and the Vice Prez have both helped me out a lot before.

I only came to the club to take a breather from work by playing a bit.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki curious %}
Ahh… That’s right, Trickstar is hard at work preparing for the SS happening at the end of the year, right?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki srsthinking %}
Hm, since it’s your day off, I feel like I’d much rather you take it easy then…
{% endbubble %}

{% img /img/es/scoutstory/toughguy/4_1.jpg %}

{% bubble Subaru grin %}
Wooah, Chi\~chan-senpai of all people is being considerate\~♪ Didn’t Sally\~ say it’s not a problem? It sounds fun, anyway.

What should we do?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki grin %}
Mm, thank you. I’ve really got such wonderful juniors.

Hmm, well… I also asked Anzu for help with this, but — I’d like you to judge his acting.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki sad %}
You see, Nagumo and I are too close to Kiryu to give an impartial evaluation, and Takamine seems afraid of Kiryu, so he can’t even look him straight in the eye.

We need someone to judge the good and bad of his acting, from an objective and clear standpoint. He won’t be able to improve without having the flaws pointed out to him.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki serious %}
Anzu seems to struggle to express her own thoughts, though, so… We need more people to judge.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Subaru %}
Ahh… She started off as a novice, so she’s got the habit of listening to other people’s comments first for judgement and observation, huh?

Even though she’s an incredible producer by now.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mao %}
I think so, too, but I guess it’s different what guys and girls focus on when it comes to acting…

And if we just have to give our thoughts, that’s not much of a burden… So I’d be glad to help.

I think it’s a great idea. With more judges, there won’t be a biased opinion.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mao awkward %}
That being said, we’re not really that experienced with acting or anything.

So please don’t expect too much from us~

If only Hokuto was here~… He’s in the Theater Club, so he probably would’ve been able to give some good advice.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki fist %}
I see. Knowing you’ll take on the role really reassures me.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki smilesoft2 %}
Isara excels on an outstanding level as an idol, yet that doesn’t make him forget how an ordinary person perceives the world. It’s a pretty balanced, rare trait.

As for Akehoshi, he can only judge things based on whether they sparkle or not, but his instincts are usually right.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki nod %}
That natural disposition of his is an irreplaceable talent.

I believe you two are the most suitable as judges.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mao norsmile %}
………
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki smileconfident %}
Mm? What’s wrong, Isara? Why’re you staring at me?

Heheh… You’ll burn if you fall for me, y’know?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mao curious %}
Ah, no… I was just thinking — You’re actually really observant of others, Buchou.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki fist %}
Fuhaha! ☆ That’s what a club captain — What a leader… No! What an *ally of justice* is all about…!

He never overlooks any evil deed, and is always on the lookout for strange phenomena! All so that he can rush to the rescue in an instant, and solve every problem in a flash!

That’s how Yumenosaki Academy’s hero, the Burning Heart Morisawa Chiaki, rolls…! Fuhahahaha! ☆
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Subaru grin %}
Uwaah… Every gesture he does is sooo flashy and obnoxious~♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mao awkward %}
Ahaha. You don’t have to repeat it so much, Buchou; nobody would ever say you aren’t a hero…♪
