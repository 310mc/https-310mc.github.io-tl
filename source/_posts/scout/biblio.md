{% bubble Midori %}
zz… zz…♪

…Mmm— H-Huh? Was I asleep?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Hajime %}
Good morning, Takamine-kun~♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
Hwa? Aah, umm…?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Hajime %}
Heheh, you’re still half-asleep~ Do you know where you are? Or could it be that you don’t remember my name?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
No, I remember… You’re my classmate, and everyone’s unique here so… Also my house is a home business, so it’s fundamental to learn people’s names…

Um, Shino-kun… Did I sleep through the whole class by any chance…?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Hajime %}
That’s right~ And then classes ended with you still sleeping, you sleepyhead.

You looked like you were having a good sleep, so I couldn’t get myself to wake you up. But I’m on day duty today, so I can’t go home yet if you’re still around.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
You could’ve woken me up then… I-I’m sorry, okay…?

Ahh, dammit… I’ve been so tired lately. Ryuseitai’s practice sessions are getting more and more severe…

I’m still not used to this idol stuff…

Um, Shino-kun… I’ll help you out with your duties as an apology…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Hajime %}
Ah, don't worry~ It’s all done with.

I’m usually doing part-time jobs in school, so I’m used to these trivial jobs, and I’m also good at them.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
I see… Uuu~ But I really do feel bad for this…

Oh, I know, I’ll give you carrots as an apology… I also have asparagus…♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Hajime %}
Huh? Why do you carry around vegetables with you? It’d help with my food expenses though, so I would be happy to take it~♪

<th>(Heheh, whenever Takamine-kun talks, he's usually mumbling like he's in a bad mood, and he's pretty big…)</th>

<th>(I thought he was a bit of a scary person at first.)</th>

<th>(But when I talked to him, he was surprisingly easy to get along with… like he has a soft-like feel to him…♪)</th>
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
<th>(Shino-kun really is a good kid… I wonder how you'd have to be raised to turn out this way…)</th>

<th>(He's kinda timid and gets startled over things at the very same time I would, so I feel a connection…)</th>
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Hajime %}
…Umm, what is it? I feel weird being stared at — You're good-looking, so it strangely makes my heart beat fast.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
Ah— Sorry, people tell me that often… Sometimes I get weird misunderstandings when I look at other people's bags with mascot plushies attached to them…

Heheh… There’s no point in chit-chatting like this, so how about we go home…?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Hajime %}
That’s true~ But I have nothing to go home immediately to do.

It’s raining heavily outside, right? Us Ra*bits scheduled to have practice on the roof, but had to hold it off in the end.

And it’s a scramble to get the indoor practice rooms on rainy days…

It looks like we couldn't get to rent one now. It’s times like these that I feel how tough it is being a frail unit.

But I can practice at home. I plan to do some independent training~

The walls are thin at home though, so I can’t really be moving around and singing so loudly.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
That so… Ryuseitai had just finished a big job, so we're on break now…

And if I go home I’ll just be told to help out in the store, so maybe I’ll go somewhere else to kill time…

Going to my Basketball Club for practice is also tiring… Maybe I’ll borrow a book from the library room and read it casually…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Hajime %}
Oh, you read books too? I didn't expect that~♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
Well, only sometimes… I like to read books at home rather than going outside… I’m pretty much an introvert, so~♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Hajime %}
Me too~ I like to read books, draw art, look at the stars…

I prefer that over sports activities, and I work with hobbies like that better.

Ehehe. If you’d like, how about we go to the library together?

I just remembered I have a borrowed book that I have to return soon, so I have to go there at some point anyway.

But only if it isn’t a bother, of course~♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
It’s not a bother at all… Just looking at you soothes me…♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Hajime %}
Really? That makes me happy\~ I’m Ra*bits, so I should be like a little animal who soothes you. Ehehe, bounce bounce\~♪

—Wah!?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
Watch out!

Be careful, okay? It’s raining today, so the floors are easier to slip on…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Hajime %}
O-Okay. Ahh, I was this close to falling over… I shouldn’t be frolicking around… Ehehe, thank you for holding me back up.

Ooh… Shino-kun, you're amazing… You got a 3.57 meter record.

{% bubble Hajime %}
Yaaay\~♪ A new record\~!

My turn now, huh… My steps are bigger so I should have an advantage…

Ahh nope, I get scared halfway that I’ll trip and immediately stop myself…

Oh! Did I make a new record again?

{% bubble Midori %}
Yep… You definitely passed over four meters; I think you may have a natural talent for this…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Hajime %}
Ehehe, sliding on the slippery corridor while on the way to the library is really fun.

Although at this rate, we won't reach it.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
It’s fine though, isn't it? It’s not like we're in a hurry… The book you borrowed won’t be due until a little later too, right…?

Besides, this is fun… You think up some great things, Shino-kun…

Hmm? Ryuseitai's Takamine and Ra*bits’… Shino, is it. Don't play around so much here.

It’s gotten slippery from the rain, so you could slip and hurt yourself if you aren't careful enough.

Hmph… I suppose you don’t seem to be actually violating any rule though, so I’ll let it slide this time.

The weather report says the rain's only going to get worse. Instead of fumbling around, go home immediately.

{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
I get it… Those people are kinda scary, aren't they…

Although, when you compare that glasses-vice-president to the person who carries a sword or the Karate Club person, he seems weak…

But I get nervous just remembering he’s an upperclassman or part of the Student Council…

Whenever Morisawa-senpai does something dumb, that person usually scolds him with a death glare…

So even though I haven’t actually done anything wrong, just encountering him makes me think I might get scolded viciously…

My big bro is also clever, and they’re pretty similar, so I cower back at encounter…

Ah, so you have an older brother? I’m also an "Onii-chan"~ I have a cute little sister and brother…♪

{% bubble Midori %}
Hey, let's go back Shino-kun, I have a bad feeling about this… This is scary, what'll we do if it’s some ghost…?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Hajime %}
Heheh, you believe in ghosts and such, Takamine-kun?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
Uuu… Of course not, but it being scary or not is a different story…

When I was young, I was told if I get picky about food then the Wasteful Ghost will come over, and it’s traumatized me since…

My parents or brother would go overboard and start throwing rotten tomatoes at me saying "What a waaaste\~♪ What a waaaste\~♪"… I hate it, I hate rotten tomatoes…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Hajime %}
Oh, I was told something like that by my parents, too. They didn't throw tomatoes at me though, that would've instead been a waste.

Heheh, this must be a thing in our area. You live nearby, right?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
Yep… In the greengrocers store in the shopping district…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Hajime %}
Oh, that's right. Then I might’ve bought things from there before.

But vegetables are usually cheaper when bought from a supermarket, so probably not that many times.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
I can’t even respond to that… We can't win against big companies that can make large amounts of their product and send it all over their branches… Small businesses are so tough…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Hajime %}
Ehehe, but from now on I’ll go to you, since it’s your store.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
Ah, then I’ll also sell you the average quality vegetables for cheap… Your home isn't that well off after all…

You're usually nibbling on bread crusts during lunch break…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Hajime %}
Oh, that would be a huge help. We're not so poor to the point of food being a problem, but since my siblings are still growing, I always prefer to use my food expenses on them instead, no matter what.

Ah— I ended up chatting away… I shouldn’t be relaxing like this.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
I ended up doing the same too… It's easy to talk to you, so it just happened on its own…

Eeek!? T-There's that scream again…!

{% bubble Hajime %}
Mmm… W-We really weren't imagining it then. It’s still scary, but it was the right choice to check what's going on.

If there’s a scream, then it must mean someone’s in trouble, right?

I don't really know what happened, but we have to save them.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
You're right about that… Ermm, where did the scream come from…? There’s thunder loudly booming outside so I can't really tell…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Hajime %}
Hmm… It has to be in the library though. But I don't see anyone here, do you?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
Shino-kun, can't you follow the trail of the sound…? You're a rabbit after all, right…?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Hajime %}
Eh? Well I *am* in Ra*bits, but I don’t have ears as good as one…

But I’m fairly good with scents, maybe I can trail it through smell like a doggie?

<th><em>(Sniff, sniff)</em></th>… Oh! I smell vegetables from you.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
Ahh, that’s 'cause I have them with me as emergency snacks… I’m still annoyingly growing up so I can get hungry easily…

Would you like to eat a carrot, Shino-kun…?

Heheh, you really do think of me as a real rabbit, don't you?

Umm… Sorry for interrupting your fun chatter, but pleeease help me.

{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Hajime %}
Ahh, um, he's the library committee member.

He’s usually there whenever I go to the library, and he sometimes helps me out in finding books, so that's how I’ve talked to him before.

Umm, Aoba-senpai, what happened? Were those screams we were hearing for some time now from you…?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tsumugi hidden %}
*Uuu*… That voice is Hajime-kun, right? P-Please lend me a hand!

Ah, hello… I’m Takamine, in the same class as Shino-kun…

Erm, Aoba-senpai, right? What are you doing over there…?

From what I can see, it seems you got flattened down by the collapsed bookcases…?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tsumugi mgn %}
Yes, that's exactly what happened~!! Please help me!

They all fell down one after the other like dominoes, I couldn't move away fast enough!

Ahhh, you really saved me! It really is good to have kind juniors~♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Hajime %}
I’m really glad you're safe~ But why were you trampled down by bookcases?

Takamine-kun had the physical strength to make it through, but I would have never been able to help you out of there if I were on my own.

I don't really understand how this happened, but please be more careful, okay?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tsumugi mgn %}
I got scolded by my junior…! Ughh, it’s not like I like being trampled by bookcases either!

I was organizing the bookcases as part of my duty as a committee member. During these times, the old books get moldy from the rain, so I was carrying all the valuable old books down to the underground archive where the humidity level is adjusted for preservation purposes.

In their place, I’d carry up books from the archive to put them in the blank spots of the bookcase.

In other words I’m, well, swapping books. It’s tough doing this when there aren't enough committee members.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Hajime %}
Um, before that, what is the underground archive?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tsumugi mgn %}
Ahh, there's something like a library downstairs. I also only learnt about it when a friend told me in my first year.

And because it’s underground, nowadays it has old books you can't get a hold of, and there's even prohibited-looking books collected from somewhere by Natsume-kun in there. It’s pretty interesting.

If you’re ever interested, I’ll show you around sometime.

But right now I don’t have my glasses and I can’t really see well. Just walking is difficult, so I can’t do it now.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Hajime %}
Ah… Now that you mention it, you really aren’t wearing your glasses today.

The impression you give off changes dramatically, you look like an elite from a prestigious school~♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
Yeah, you look like my big bro…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tsumugi mgn %}
Huh? In what way are you seeing me? I haven't looked at myself in the mirror without glasses for a while, so I really don't remember how I looked without them!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Hajime %}
Heheh, you look cool\~ I think you look more superb without glasses\~♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tsumugi mgn %}
Is that so? Ooh, you youngsters are making me blush!

But my glasses are my lucky item, so I don't usually want to take them off, you know~?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Hajime %}
Heheh. You really like things like fortune-telling, lucky charms, and Buddhist prayers, right? Even your book cover is somewhat mandala-patterned.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tsumugi mgn %}
Ahh, I got that from a friend long ago. It’s worn out by now, but it’s something that has memories to it, so I can't get myself to throw it away.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Hajime %}
I know what you mean~ I dried up a flower I received from Tomoya-kun and now use it as a bookmark.

Tomoya-kun saw it when he came to my house a few days ago, and I got pretty embarrassed…

He didn't seem to remember the flower, though.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
I think the conversation went way off track… Um, Aoba-senpai, like we asked, why were you trampled by bookcases…?

I feel uneasy not knowing the answer to things like that, so…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tsumugi mgn %}
Ahh, sorry. Erm, like I said, I was organizing books.

I lent my glasses to a friend for a little while, or well, midway at work they were taken away from me…

So I couldn't see very well and, um, an accident happened.

I lost my balance on the stepladder and collapsed on the bookcase…

The impact made it tip back over to me, like the bookcase was saying *"it’s my turn now"* as it toppled over me.

Ahh, I really thought I was going to die… And today's been raining heavily, so everyone’s already gone home or something — No matter how many times I yelled for help no one came over.

I was this close to thinking about giving up on this world and finding happiness in the next lifetime.

Not that there's any proof that you can be reborn again, though~ Even if I did reincarnate, I’d probably be a bug or something.

I’ve committed many sins, after all.

{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Keito %}
Aoba.  …What happened to your glasses?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tsumugi mgn %}
Ahh, I ended up lending them to Rei-kun.

He was saying something like he was bored because of the rain, so I suggested he borrow some books.

But it seems like he couldn't read small text, so he just took my glasses with him.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Keito %}
That's unfortunate. So that vampire is causing trouble to people as always, huh…

I was even thinking he was finally being more considerate to his surroundings, but people don't change that easily, it seems.

Well, it’s fine. Wait here a bit, Aoba. I’ve been keeping some spare glasses in the Student Council office, so I’ll bring them over. What's your eyesight?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tsumugi mgn %}
Hmm… I’m not sure. I haven't done an eye test in a while, so I don't know.

{% bubble Tsumugi mgn %}
Ahh, please spare me the lecture. I’m aware I’m hopeless, but if I’m constantly being told that I’ll definitely get mopey about it.

Besides, it isn’t like I don’t like it~

When I complained about my hair suffocating me from the humidity of the rain, he said he'd tie it up for me.

And then I ended up letting him do as he likes.

I can't do my work anyway since I can't see anything without glasses, so I thought of taking a break while waiting for you~
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Keito %}
I’ve said this far too many times, but if your hair irritates you, then get a haircut.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tsumugi mgn %}
And I keep telling you that no can do, it’s part of a Buddhist prayer so I can't cut it.

Though, during rainy days, it starts curling up from the humidity and feels ticklish on my skin.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Hajime %}
I know what you mean~ I also can't cut my hair due to how Ra*bits works, but during these days it’s really humid, so combing my hair is tricky.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tsumugi mgn %}
Ah, a buddy! Handshake~♪

Although I think your hairstyle suits you perfectly, so it's fine as it is.

But for me it doesn't seem like it suits me, doesn't have a single advantage, and only causes a great deal of pain~ Even Natsume-kun often gets angry at me for it.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
I think it's best to do your hair as you like though… Summer's coming soon, so if you keep it long, it'll probably get all the more suffocating…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Hajime %}
Heheh. Well, having long hair has its benefits too.

Whenever my sister wants to do a new hairstyle, she attempts it on my hair first.

Maybe it’s to release stress, but she usually makes it into an endless braid.

She likes my hair a lot, saying "Onii-chan, don't cut it!"

But my little brother says I look like a girl with long hair… He's too embarrassed about it, and we no longer have baths together.

There's no such thing as reincarnation, or at least I don't accept that idea. You work hard in *this* lifetime.

Not at all, you're really helping me out here~ If I can finish organizing the underground archive, it'll be one thing done with.

This place isn't like upstairs and hadn't been touched, so it's been an enormous amount of work.

Natsume-kun did as he pleased and made it sound-proof…

So you can play some music, or be noisy to an extent, so long as you make all the bookcases fixed in their place.

That's why, I’ve always thought about letting kids who can't borrow a lesson room come here instead whenever there’s heavy rain.

And so that I can do that, I’m taking all the valuable books to the Secret Room.

I don’t think anyone will steal them, but it’s just in case. There’s really no reason to rush, so please take your time.

Ahh, if you can make this room a place to practice that'd be helpful.

A frail unit like us can never rent practice rooms… So we end up having a massive amount of free time on days like these.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Keito %}
Huh, so you've thought of something like that, Aoba.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tsumugi %}
Eh? Is this possibly something I shouldn't do without permission?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Keito %}
Well, normally you *should* be getting permission. If you report it to us we'll accept it.

Lately the academy's been very lively with activities, and the insufficient amount of practice rooms and other has been a problem, so this is good timing.

This is only a suggestion, but you could make it so that as a reward for helping out with the library work, people can then use the underground archive as a practice room.

Your problem will be resolved in a swipe. How about it?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tsumugi %}
You're all about efficiency, aren't you~ Alright then, I’ll write the document with that notion.

But before that, I should at least get things done with to the barest minimum. With the speed it's going, I'll be done by dawn after an all-nighter.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Keito %}
Go home when you’re meant to.

…The same goes for you two. If the rain doesn't stop, I’ll prepare a car and force you to go home. If I ask my brother, he should bring a car over.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tsumugi %}
Your household’s car isn't a hearse or something, right?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Keito %}
We have a normal car, too. We have a lot of work at the temple that needs us to go around everywhere, so my brother put the benefit and the interest for cars together, and started collecting vehicles.

Kiryuu saw his motorbike and was incredibly impressed.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tsumugi %}
Hmm, your brother does seem the type to like that stuff. But I’m kind of bad at dealing with him~ He starts lecturing me whenever we meet.

Though, well, you were like that in the past, too.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Keito %}
It’s because *I* can't exorcise your darkness, since I’m a novice. I still need more training.
{% endbubble %}

## Bind and Unfold 7

{% bubble Midori %}
Umm… I have a small question; this book has a sequel, right…?

I really liked this story when I was young, so I wanna read it after so long…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tsumugi %}
Which book?

Ahh… I'm sorry to say this, but… the author of that book passed away, so it's forever a discontinued series.

I read it before too; it ended right at a really good part, didn't it? I really get how you feel about wanting to know what happens next.

Ah— But there's a fan work by a fan of the story who wrote their own sequel, and I know just where it is.

I think that fan was as curious as you and ended up writing it.

Keito-kun, Keito-kun, that book… Do you have the books by Mizuhanome-sensei around with you?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Keito %}
I almost want to say that I burnt them, but it’s probably somewhere in the storage room if I were to look for it.

I’m warning you now though, it's nothing compared to the original. Just an amateur fan work… It's nothing interesting.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tsumugi %}
Heheh, I thought it was really well written, though~ I liked it.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Keito %}
I’m not satisfied with it. Mizuhanome-sensei thought it would be impossible to convey the original author’s world view in a manga, so they[^2] uncharacteristically put together a text-only work instead, but…

It just went to show how inexperienced they were as a writer, and that they’d been using their art to compensate for it.

I got a lot of advice from you on how to write… Aoba.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
…? Mmm, I got mixed in with some conversation…?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Keito %}
Don't worry about it. It has nothing to do with you, it's only a story of the past.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tsumugi %}
Heheh, you see Takamine-kun, Keito-kun may not look it, but he really likes to think up stories—
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Keito %}
Aoba! Stop saying needless things!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tsumugi %}
Ahaha, you don't have to be so flustered~♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Keito %}
You really make me want to punch you sometimes. No wonder you were Eichi's biggest friend; you even rub me the wrong way just like him.

You better come over to my temple once for training, that way I can beat you up without needing to hold back.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tsumugi %}
I don’t like being hurt~ I keep telling you I’m not an animal, so you don't have to hurt me for me to understand. Just words would be enough.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Keito %}
Hmph, anything said to you is just wasted effort.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Hajime %}
Ehehe, you two get along well~ I didn't expect it.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Keito %}
That's how you see it? As you can see, this guy's the type you can't leave alone, so I end up severely lecturing him, that's all.

We're absolutely *not* friends.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tsumugi %}
Ehh~ We're friends though, aren't we? We were both bookworms since long back, and ended up meeting each other often in the library, and that's how we ended up talking.

We even lent each other our favorite books and stuff.

If only I could have aaalways had friendships that were easy-going like that but… Life doesn't go as you always want it to, does it?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Keito %}
That's why I think it's interesting. That's how I’ve started to think lately.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Hajime %}
I can feel the implications behind all that~ Ehehe, even though we're only a few years apart… Third years really do have a mature feel to them.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tsumugi %}
We're only putting up a front, you know~? We're all just sensitive delicate teenagers, after all.

Don't think of us as adults who can take in anything; please go easy on us too, okay?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Keito %}
Don't say something so pathetic. Shino, it's fine, alright? If you ever have anything to say, go ahead and say it. Even if it’s hostile or hatred, feel free to hit it at us.

Although I’d rather you don't hit me with a book. I'll die if you hit a critical spot, and the book might dent, too. You’re so damn rash.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Hajime %}
Like I said, that wasn't on purpose, really! …I-I’ll be okay next time! I’ll do my best, I’ll definitely do it right!

Here I go~ Heave-ho! ☆
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Keito %}
Oh, you did it perfectly this time, good job, good job~♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
Shino-kun's a real hard-worker…

Umm, I’ll do some work too… I look like I'm the only one who's slacking off while everyone's doing their best… It feels all wrong…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tsumugi %}
Heheh, alright then, please help me out a bit. We're going to be pasting barcode labels onto old book collections.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
Ah, I kinda like doing small work like that…♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tsumugi %}
I thought so~ Just because you're well-built doesn't mean I should assume you like manual labor, right?

Ah, that's right… I’m changing the subject but… I just remembered Natsume-kun asked me to think about a live show that's enticing exactly because it’s on a rainy day.

It's fine if you keep working, but if it's alright, I’d love to think up ideas with you all.

If you think up something that can be used as material, then telling me about it is good enough.

Three people together have the wisdom of Manjushri[^3], so with four people, we'll think up something even greater.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Keito %}
By the way, Manjushri is a bodhisattva that governs wisdom—
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tsumugi %}
Ah, we really don't need that kind of trivia~

I’m sure we’d all love to talk more, but talking around so many books might make the mold and dust get in your trachea and hurt your throat.

That's why I didn't want help from idols, since it might be a problem to have that happen… But I was lonely all by myself too, so I’m a little conflicted with my feelings.

But it's more or less a happy feeling, so I want to think this was the right choice.
{% endbubble %}

## Epilogue

{% bubble Keito %}
Alright, we sorted most of it out.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tsumugi %}
Great work~ You really are amazing at this, Keito-kun. Ahh, I'm sooo thankful for all the help.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Keito %}
Hmph. You don’t have to keep thanking us. It’s my duty to assist, that’s all.

We killed enough time until the rain showers passed, and I got to move around without needless thoughts for once, so I also feel thankful.

I have to think a lot when doing my Student Council work, and I’m the vice president so I can’t be shoddy with my work.

But since the library work is your job, even if I do make a mistake it'll be under your responsibility in the end.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tsumugi %}
Wha— You're cruel! Are you saying you don't care what happens to me!?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Keito %}
If I did, I would've never helped you in the first place… If you need it, I’ll give the library committee some budget and get some new members. Do you?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tsumugi %}
Oh, no~ Actually, other than a special job like this, I usually have way too much free time, so it's enough with only me more or less.

Most of the big work that used to be for the committee was taken by the Student Council, anyway.

Like managing the budget of the school's funds like a bank, or the supervision over the school's social media.

Next year onward, the library will be like a sub-section of the Student Council and merge with them, right? So until then I’m here.

I’ll make sure to make it possible to hand it over in a way that won't let our juniors suffer, so please do help me out on that, Keito-kun.

Thank you so much for today.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Keito %}
Like I said, stop thanking me… Hm?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tsumugi %}
Oh, Anzu-chan! Good evening~ Do you have something you need at the archive?

You want to borrow books or materials? You've come at the right time\~ I just finished organizing the books\~♪

What kind of book are you looking for?

—Wh—AHH!?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
That was close! Please be careful, Aoba-senpai…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tsumugi %}
I-I'm sorry. I was this close to falling down… I’m not used to these glasses so my perception is all wobbly…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Keito %}
Do you have a *problem* with the glasses I lent you?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tsumugi %}
Nooo, that isn't what I—…

Wait, Takamine-kun, what are you doing sitting down here?

If you aren't feeling well, I’ll help you to the infirmary, okay?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
Ah, no, I’m used to labor work, so I’m feeling alright, but… It looks like Shino-kun got so tired out he ended up sleeping…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Hajime %}
zzzzz…♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
See… He's sound asleep while leaning right on my shoulder, so I can’t move… Sorry, I tried to help since I wasn't doing anything, but…

One of the books I picked up looked interesting and I ended up reading it only to sleep midway into it, and I ended up being no help at all…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tsumugi %}
Ahaha, it's fine~ It’s the thought that counts. I’m happy with that, enough for tears to come out.

You're all still kids after all, I’m not asking for end results.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
Please don't treat me like a kid, our age doesn't differ that much… But I guess I can't say anything when this is how things turned out…

C'mon, Shino-kun, wake up… It's dark outside, we should be going home now…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Hajime %}
Mm~ <th><em>(fumble)</em></th>…… <em><th>(nibble nibble)</th></em> ♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
Ughh, don't eat my uniform… Eh, I’m gonna keep getting bigger and need to buy a change of uniform anyway, so I guess it’s fine…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tsumugi %}
Heheh, you two get along~ I’m jealous.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Keito %}
Hey, you've left the transfer student all alone without a follow-up, respond back properly.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tsumugi %}
Aahh…? I'm sorry about that, so what really brought you here… Anzu-chan?

Eh— You brought back my glasses?

I see… Looks like stuff happened on that side. So Rei-kun lost my glasses, and tried to look for them all over school?

Then he finally found them, but he was up all day so he got tired and ended up sleeping in his coffin…

And as substitute, you came to bring back the glasses instead, right?

It really would've been fine if you had given them to Rei-kun… But that person surprisingly gets worried over things like this, huh.

Heheh, yep, I got them. It's been a while, my glasses~♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Keito %}
Hold on Aoba, you're already wearing glasses so don't try to put another pair on top of them. The frames will get damaged, and the lens will get scratched up too.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tsumugi %}
Glasses this, glasses that, so annoying~ Mmm… My glasses are a bit dirty, so until I clean them up I’ll wear the glasses I borrowed from you, Keito-kun.

Since the friendship I feel from you is warm and makes me happy.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Keito %}
Hm… You've said a prayer with those glasses, right? It's unusual of you to keep aside your "lucky charm" like that. What's with this change of mind, Aoba?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tsumugi %}
I’m changing too, bit by bit, you know? Changing ever so slowly alongside this academy…

And I'm deeply hoping this change will be a good thing.

I can't stay as I was in the past, but I’m a dunce so I’m not changing all that well either…

But this should be much more delightful than halting myself in one place.

There's no such thing as a rain shower that won't stop, and if it rains, then you also get to see a lovely rainbow.

I look forward to things like that and hope that they'll be that way, and so… Today, tomorrow, and even the day after, I'll keep living.

## Translation Notes
[^1]: Specifically, a monk who practices austerity to the point of death and mummification.
[^2]: Keito doesn’t use any pronouns when talking about the fan work author until he says this line. But in English I needed to add a pronoun and went with “they”.
[^3]: i.e two heads are better than one.
