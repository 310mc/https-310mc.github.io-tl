Ah, the weather is quite lovely today. Despite the lingering summer heat, it’s the perfect day to go to school.

Having graduated, I can’t help but feel somewhat nostalgic watching those who commute to school as summer vacation ends.

Putting that aside—Yuzuru. Keeping quiet won’t get you anywhere.

You probably want to give me your report and head to school as soon as possible, don’t you? There’s no need to put it off, you can go ahead and tell me.

About that certain *phenomenon* involving you all, that is.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Yuzuru %}
My apologies. I did mean to inform you; However, it became difficult to summarize, and I myself am somewhat disoriented as I am not quite sure where to start.

Since I can’t seem to find a way to put it shortly, I suppose I will tell you the story from beginning to end.

This is how the state of affairs at the Starmony Dormitory came to be.

<div class="msr-narration">
    <p>Immediately following the MDM, in the old Starmony dorms, ALKALOID’s room…</p>
</div>

{% bubble Yuzuru %}
Good morning, esteemed members of ALKALOID. Have you finished your preparations in order to move out?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Hiiro %}
Indeed, I don’t have many belongings to begin with, so it did not take long.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Yuzuru %}
It does all appear to fit into a single cardboard box. Fufu. By the looks of it, you’re a minimalist quite like myself.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Hiiro %}
Minimalist…? What does that mean?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Yuzuru %}
It refers to an individual with a principle not to carry around more than that which is indispensable. Since the dormitories are quite small in comparison to our residence, I had been trying to educate the Young Master on the concept…

From now on, the four of you belonging to ALKALOID will live in the new Starmony Dormitory building alongside the rest of your fellow idols.

As the old building will become unoccupied, I must advise you to please ensure that you do not leave any of your belongings behind.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tatsumi %}
Fufu, so this day has finally come.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mayoi %}
I feel as if a weight has been lifted from my shoulders… It’ll be lonely to live in separate rooms, but I’m so glad we didn’t get fireddd…♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tatsumi %}
Indeed.

I’ll miss all of you dearly as well, but whenever there is a parting, a meeting shall follow.

I’d like to express my thanks to the old building for taking us underachievers in our time of need, and let us look forward to the next chapter of our lives.

Now then, shall we take our things and go our separate ways?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Aira %}
Huh, you guys are ready to leave already!? Am I really the only one who hasn’t finished packing yet?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Hiiro %}
You still aren’t finished yet, Aira?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Aira %}
Watch your mouth Hiro-kun! That isn’t very nice of you…

I have a lot of items to pack so it takes time. Someone with so few things like yourself wouldn’t understand!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Hiiro %}
Indeed… If that’s the case, you should become a minimalist like Fushimi-senpai. It takes a lot of time to pack up if you have a lot of stuff, after all.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Aira %}
Hey, don’t think I’ll just let you get away with saying that!? My ‘stuff’ isn’t just stuff! It’s treasure! My treasured idol merch!

Idol fans are totally the opposite of minimalists!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Hiiro %}
Is that so? The antonym of ‘minimalist’ is ‘idol fan’. I understand now.

It’s amazing how many treasures you have, Aira!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Aira %}
That’s not what I’m trying to say at all!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tatsumi %}
Fufu. You two get along so well.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mayoi %}
Ummm, Aira-san, would you like me to help you? If you don’t mind, that is…

I tend to sweat the small stuff since I’m so nervous, so I’m quite good at organizing important items— if that makes sense…!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Aira %}
No worries, I got this! I’m gonna live under the same roof as idols I totally look up to― so I have to take care of myself!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tatsumi %}
You do have a point Aira-san.

From now on, you will be living with other people. Living with a stranger will require you to be more independent.

Yuzuru-san, I apologize for the fact that you had to come all the way out to the old dormitory. Would you kindly give us a bit more time to vacate the room?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Yuzuru %}
Please, do not fret. You mustn’t worry for me.

This job was assigned to me by Eichi-sama, which grants us a certain lenience in terms of schedule. Furthermore, I have enlisted the assistance of a few more helpers from StarPro.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tatsumi %}
Helpers…?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Yuzuru %}
Indeed. I had them wait outside for a moment in consideration of your privacy, yet I believe it is about time to call them in.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tori hidden %}
Yuzuru? Can I come in already?

I’m *tired*, I seriously can’t deal with Morisawa-senpai anymore!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Yuzuru %}
Oh, my. Speak of the devil.

Yes. Young Master, Morisawa-sama, you may come in.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki %}
Fuhaaahahaha~! I’ve kept all you good kids waiting!

Ryusei Red is here to aid you in your cleanup!

Now then! Which luggage should I carry first? It’s always sad to say farewell, but our passionate hearts can blow those feelings away! Come, let’s move all your luggage with high spirits!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tori %}
All this energy’s got me exhausted by now…

It’s not like I wanted to show up in their room uninvited, but think about how I feel being stuck with this guy!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki %}
Oh, what’s up, what’s wrong!? I don’t sense any energy from you, Himemiya!

We can’t be like that! It’ll make it harder for ALKALOID to part ways, you know!?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tori %}
No, no, it’s not that kind of vibe at all here. They’re still gonna be close enough to see each other whenever they want anyway, it’s not really that serious.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Yuzuru %}
…As you can see, the Young Master is acting as a supervisor. We requested Morisawa-sama’s help with the transportation of the luggage.

A baggage handler could have been contacted, yet Eichi-sama considered us qualified as “no one would be as understanding as a fellow idol”.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tatsumi %}
I see. Communal life necessitates communal work.

Thank you for taking time out of your busy schedule to help us. The lord will surely take note of your good deeds.
{% endbubble %}

## The Cursed Ox Statue 2

<div class="msr-narration">
    <p>A few hours later…</p>
</div>

{% bubble Aira %}
Phew, all done~! I finally got everything packed!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Yuzuru %}
Good job. All that is left to do now is to carry these boxes to the new building.

The sun may have set, but fortunately, we will be able to finish moving by tonight.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tatsumi %}
It seems I’ll be sharing a room with Koga-san. He seems rather difficult to get along with, I’m a bit concerned I may accidentally upset him.

As for everyone else, who do you all share your new rooms with?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Hiiro %}
I’ll be with 2wink’s Aoi Hinata-kun, and Crazy:B’s Shiina-san. Fufu, so Crazy:B are also moving out of the old dormitory.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mayoi %}
I… I ended up with Mashiro-san of Ra*bits.

Oh no. I wonder if we can live together without any problems… Now I’m getting nervous…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tatsumi %}
You’re a very compassionate person, Mayoi-san, you should have no trouble. You love thy neighbor as thyself.

…And Aira-san, who are you sharing your room with?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Aira %}
I’m… with Tenshouin-senpai and Sakuma-senpai…

*No way*! I can’t, I can’t! *Ohmygosh* I’m gonna dieeee!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Hiiro %}
Well, if you’re unhappy, I’ll switch rooms with you?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Aira %}
That’s not what I mean, you idiot! I’m so happy it feels like my heart is gonna stop! I’m gonna die because I’m so happy― that kind of feeling!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Hiiro %}
…? I don’t really understand that feeling, but, I suppose things are fine as is.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tatsumi %}
Now then, please leave the remainder of the work to me. I’m sure you’re quite busy with the new semester starting tomorrow, so allow me to complete our moving paperwork.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Hiiro %}
You have been such a great help to us, Tatsumi-senpai. Even today, you’re taking care of us as the eldest in ALKALOID.

Just thinking back on it, the time spent in this room is full of precious memories.

Even though it has only been a month, it feels as if more has happened here than in the decade or so that I spent in my hometown.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Aira %}
Yup, I agree.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mayoi %}
I feel the same.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tatsumi %}
And I as well. I feel as if I’ve been saved, and I have you three to thank. I must give my thanks to this room, the place where I was able to live together with you all.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Hiiro %}
Then I shall also say thanks! And now we press onward― to Starmony Dormitory!

We’ve taken our first step as idols, and I can only hope this new building will treat us well.
{% endbubble %}

<div class="msr-location">
    <p><span><b>Location:</b> Starmony Dorm Common Room</span></p>
</div>

{% img /img/es/scoutstory/ushimairip2/2_1.jpg %}

{% bubble Tatsumi %}
Yuzuru-san, I’ve filled out the paperwork, will that be all?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Yuzuru %}
Let me see.

…Yes, there are no mistakes here. That concludes the procedure of moving into the new building. Thank you all for your hard work today.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tatsumi %}
I should be the one saying that to you― thank you for staying here so late. Your classes will start tomorrow as well, won’t they? I truly do appreciate all you’ve done for us.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Yuzuru %}
Oh, there is no need to worry about me at all.

Besides, the members of ALKALOID aside from yourself have classes tomorrow as well, do they not?

I truly hope that everyone will be able to rest well, although the new environment may cause a certain uneasiness.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tatsumi %}
Fufu, after overcoming such an ordeal as they have, they should be fine.

In any case, there seem to be many Yumenosaki students in their new rooms. I think they’ll fit right in.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tori %}
Fufu. Tomorrow, the Student Council is gonna give a speech to the whole student body, so you’d better be excited for it ♪

It’s a shame that it’s gonna be the new prez giving the speech and not me, but we’ve gotta show those guys still holding onto summer vacation the power of the Student Council!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Yuzuru %}
Indeed. This is an opportunity for Isara-sama to prove himself.

Oh, come to think of it, before we part—there was a forgotten item in the old building, so I must ask you as a final request to please take it with you.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tatsumi %}
Forgotten item…?

That’s unusual. I don’t recall seeing such a thing while we were cleaning.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Yuzuru %}
I was surprised myself. I found it while I was checking the old building as we were about to leave. Does this ox statue ring any bells, by chance?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tatsumi %}
Hm…?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki %}
Huh, this is one strange-looking object, isn’t it?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tori %}
Ugh, so tasteless… Does this belong to someone in ALKALOID?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tatsumi %}
I’ve never seen such a thing while I was residing with them… How about I reach out to them over Hold Hands and send a photo?

…Ah, it appears they’re just as lost as we are.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tori %}
Hmm… Then what was this thing doing in the old building? It seems pretty unlikely that those Crazy:B guys would’ve left it there as a joke.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki %}
That’s true. Crazy:B would always go for tactics that make them stand out— Plus, one of them cares deeply about his brother. I can’t imagine them going for such a subtle kind of joke.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tatsumi %}
I don’t think they’re responsible either. We all lived in the old dormitory together, but they hardly interfered with us.

Given the circumstances prior to MDM, I wonder if something was left behind in the room after all…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Yuzuru %}
But in that case, who should it be returned to…? I haven’t got the slightest idea.

For the time being, I believe we should leave this statue at the Starmony Dorm as a lost item.

It does not appear to be expensive, and if it is placed in the common room, its owner may eventually find it.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tatsumi %}
Indeed, that seems like a suitable course of action.

O ox statue with nowhere to go, may you find your rightful owner in the end― Amen.
{% endbubble %}

## The Cursed Ox Statue 3

<div class="msr-location">

<div class="msr-narration">
    <p>The next morning…</p>
</div>

{% bubble Yuzuru %}
<th>(Fufu. Reading in the morning turned out to be surprisingly enjoyable.)</th>

<th>(Since I no longer reside in the mansion, I have no use for the time I spend awake after waking up at sunrise…)</th>

<th>(Fortunately, I discovered the joy of reading through my participation in the filming of *Fist of the Shangri-la Idol.*)</th>[^1]

<th>(In this way, I can make use of my spare time thinking of and envisioning lives vastly different from my own. By learning of the world that surrounds oneself, one can also gain knowledge applicable to their own life.)</th>

<th>(To be a proficient butler for the Young Master, I should keep in mind the various teachings and philosophies that I have learned and put them into practice myself.)</th>
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tori %}
Hmm… *<th>(mumble mumble)</th>* …Yuzuru, I can’t eat that many manjuus…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Yuzuru %}
What is he dreaming of, I wonder…?

It is about time. Young Master, please wake up. The second school semester will start today. As part of the Student Council’s leadership, we cannot afford to be unpunctual.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tori %}
Ugh… five more minutes…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Yuzuru %}
If I were to give you five more minutes, we would be late. Is something as disgraceful as arriving late to the Student Council’s speech truly the impression that you wish to give to the entirety of the student body?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tori %}
Okay, okay, I’ll get up…

Look! I got up, Yuzuru~ Help me with the usual routine.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Yuzuru %}
Of course. First, you must attend to your appearance. Please wash your face in the bathroom.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tori %}
Alriiight.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Yuzuru %}
Young Master, here is your towel.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tori %}
<em><th>(scrub, scrub)</th></em>…♪

There. Now it’s time to get dressed, and after that we’ll go to the kitchen for breakfast, right?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Yuzuru %}
Right. I have prepared your clothes for you. Everything has been cleaned spotless.

Despite how you proclaimed that you would "take care of the unpacking yourself", the uniform was still in the closet, so I took it upon myself to clean it up ♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tori %}
That’s our Yuzuru. Number one in thoughtfulness ♪

…I mean, I would’ve done it if you just told me! I said I’d take care of my own matters by myself, didn’t I?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Yuzuru %}
Sigh. Your unceasing stubbornness is quite troubling.

I am more than aware that you wish to become more self-reliant, but you cannot go to school wearing a uniform covered in lint and dust.

Furthermore, you postponed washing your uniform to the point that there was no choice but to order a new one, did you not?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tori %}
Hmph. Well, I don’t *want* to go to school looking all shabby…
{% endbubble %}

<div class="msr-narration">
    <p>Time passes…</p>
</div>

{% bubble Tori %}
…There. I’m done changing. This is fine, right?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Yuzuru %}
No. Your tie is crooked.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tori %}
S-so you noticed. You see, I was actually testing you!

Anyways. Now that we’re ready, let’s go have breakfast in the common room!

Hm\~hm\~hm ♪ Today starts\~ the new semester\~♪ Let’s have fun this new semester\~♪

Gyaah!?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Yuzuru %}
Young Master!?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tori %}
T-T-T-T-Th…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Yuzuru %}
What is the matter? Pointing your finger—

Hm. That is the ox statue from last night. I cannot fathom why on Earth it would be in front of our dorm room…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tori %}
Hey, Yuzuru! Can we cancel today’s plans? Someone definitely has it out for us!

Someone who fears the Student Council’s authority put the statue here as a warning to cease all Student Council activities!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Yuzuru %}
Where did you get that idea…?

In any case, be at ease. If anything were to happen, I would protect you, so let us head to the dining room without a worry.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tori %}
Even if you say I shouldn’t worry, I’m still worried! Waaah!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Yuzuru %}
Y-Young Master, please calm down. Even if this truly was an act of malice towards you…

There would be no need for such a warning to be expressed in a manner as roundabout as an ox statue placed in front of our room.

If you think about it rationally, does it not make much more sense for it to be a simple coincidence?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tori %}
B-but, I’m scared! Yuzuru, do somethiiiing!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Yuzuru %}
Sigh. This is quite the elaborate prank.

Was there any particular motive to put the statue here, I wonder…?
