{% bubble Tomoya yawn %}
…*Yawns.*
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Hajime %}
That was a big yawn~♪ Did you stay up late last night?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tomoya frown %}
No, I’m sleeping properly.

Summer holidays just ended, so I might’ve relaxed my mind a little too much. I’ve gotta get a hold of myself.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Hajime %}
Fufu. Isn’t it fine to stay relaxed for the time being?

You’re a hard worker, Tomoya-kun, and you’re always giving your best efforts. You should let yourself rest whenever you can, okay?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tomoya %}
It’s alright, I really am resting properly.

Plus, I can’t push myself so hard that I potentially lose all strength at a crucial moment.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tomoya frown2 %}
But resting and relaxing your mind are two different things, yeah? So I’ll try my best to improve my focus.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Hajime smile %}
Focus… Oh, I know.

We still have time before afternoon classes begin, so would you like to go to the Garden Terrace?

There should be some herb tea stocked up in the Tea Club, and it helps improve focus. Let’s drink it together~♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tomoya %}
You sure? Alright, I’ll gladly take that offe— Huh?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Hajime idle %}
What’s wrong, Tomoya-kun?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tomoya idle %}
Look over there… It’s Mitsuru. What’s he doing, crouched down near the hedges?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Hajime %}
Is he looking for something…? Let’s go and ask him.

Hello, Mitsuru-kun. What are you doing here?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mitsuru smilesoft %}
Me? I’m looking for litter!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tomoya curious %}
Litter? I could understand if this was last year, but you doing a school part-time job nowadays is kinda unusual, isn’t it?[^1]
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mitsuru fist %}
Nah, this isn’t for a part-time job. I’m doing it ‘cuz I wanna!

I felt super energetic after eating lunch, so I went dashing around… But then I stepped on litter and almost tripped on myself.

So I’m picking up the litter to make sure that nobody trips on themselves when dashing!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tomoya curious %}
I think you’re the only one who’d run around during breaktime, though…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tomoya norsmile %}
But it’s pretty admirable of you to pick up litter all on your own, Mitsuru~♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mitsuru grin %}
Really? Ehehe, it’s not every day I get praised by Tomo-chan! ♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mitsuru curious %}
But I’m just picking ‘em up ‘cuz I wanna, y’know? Is it really something to be praised for?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Hajime nod %}
Of course. Picking up litter is a good deed, after all.

They say that “To pick up litter is to pick up fortune.” I’m sure something good will happen to you.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mitsuru idle %}
Picking up fortune? What’s that mean?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Hajime %}
It comes from the concept, “Those who throw litter are throwing away their own fortune and integrity as well.” So by picking up other people’s litter, your own fortune increases.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mitsuru %}
It’s got that sorta effect!? Picking up litter is *amazing!*
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tomoya awkward %}
It’s just superstition, so don’t expect too much, okay~?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tomoya northinking %}
But it doesn’t change the fact that it’s a good thing to do, so maybe I should pick up some litter too.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mitsuru worried %}
No, no can do! I’m gonna pick up all the litter around here, so you can’t snatch any of ‘em!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tomoya awkward %}
Snatch…?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mitsuru frustrated %}
The litter here is all mine~!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tomoya smile %}
Whaat… Alright, alright. Just make sure to sort them in the right bin when you put them in the trash, ‘kay?

See ya then, Mitsuru.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Hajime smilesoft2 %}
Good luck with picking up all the litter.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mitsuru grin %}
Mhm! Byebye, Hajime-chan, Tomo-chan~! ☆

“To pick up litter is to pick up fortune,” huh~… First time I’ve heard of it.

My fortune will increase if I pick up litter… Which means this button and this candy wrapping paper are also scraps of fortune!

So maybe something good will happen if I collect some more? Aaalright, let’s do this!
{% endbubble %}

    <p>Same day, after classes are over…</p>
</div>

{% bubble Mitsuru %}
I think I picked up all the litter in the connecting corridor, so I came to the Garden Terrace!

There’s fallen leaves and fruits all over, so I can pick up as much as I want here!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mitsuru northinking %}
But those kinds of things weren’t dropped by someone…? Does that mean my fortune won’t increase, then?

Mm…?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mitsuru smile %}
Well, don’t gotta worry about the details! It’ll feel good to make the place clean, so I’mma pick ‘em all up!

♪\~♪\~♪ *<th>(Humming)</th>*
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mao smilesoft %}
—There you are. I’ve been looking for you, Tenma.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mitsuru %}
Ah, Stuco Prez Nii~chan! Didja need me for something?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mao %}
I heard what you’ve been doing~ You picked up the litter in the connecting corridor all on your own, right?

It was bugging me how much was littered around, so I was thinking of cleaning it up after classes today… But you saved me a bunch by doing it instead.

This is my thanks to you. You can have it.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mitsuru grin %}
Yaaay, stuffed bread!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mao curious %}
But I’m surprised you’re picking up litter here, too. Is it a hobby of yours?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mitsuru %}
Nah, I’m just picking them up ‘cuz I wanna!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mitsuru smug %}
“To pick up litter is to pick up fortune” — Doing good things will increase my fortune! Ehen~♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mao smile %}
Oh? Maybe I should learn from you and pick up the habit~♪

—Ah, it’s already this hour, huh. I should get back to the Student Council office.

Right, see ya then, Tenma.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mitsuru grin %}
Bye-bye! Thanks for the bread!

Ehehe. I got stuffed bread~!

…Ah! So this is what “your fortune increases” means? If I pick up litter, will something good happen again?

Alright! I’ll keep picking up more and more and increase my fortune by a whole ton~!

{% bubble Chiaki serious %}
Looks like nobody’s here yet. I guess I’m the first to come, then.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki curious %}
…Mm? I hear humming coming from the flowerbed.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mitsuru nod %}
\~♪\~♪ *<th>(Humming)</th>*
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki smile %}
Oh, Tenma-kun. Good morning! What are you doing here?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mitsuru %}
Ah, Chia-chan-senpai! As you can see, I’m weeding!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki idle %}
Weeding? Did someone ask you to do that?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mitsuru grin %}
Nope! I’m doing it ‘cuz I wanna!

I actually wanted to pick up litter, but the courtyard is already clean, so there’s nothing on the ground.

That’s why I’m weeding insead! The flowerbed’ll be spotless if I pluck out all the weed! ☆
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki smilesoft %}
Devoting yourself to clean-ups is really admirable of you. I really respect that! ☆
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mitsuru fist %}
Picking up litter is amazing. Everyone praises me, it makes the place clean, and my fortune goes up!

It’s just getting me more and more into picking up litter~☆
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki smileconfident %}
Oh yeah, is that so? There’s still a little time to spare before our appointed gathering for Sports Survivors, so I’ll help you out, too.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mitsuru curious %}
You’ll help out, Chia-chan-senpai? Mm\~… M\~m…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki idle %}
Is there a problem by some chance…?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mitsuru srsthinking %}
I wanna have all the litter on the ground for myself, but I feel like I’d be too greedy to have all these weeds for myself, too…?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mitsuru smile %}
Okay, I’ve made up my mind! Chia-chan-senpai, let’s do weeding together!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki fist %}
Got it! Let’s do our best until everyone arrives!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Subaru %}
Oh— It’s the Dash-Dash Kid and Chi~chan-senpai![^2]
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Adonis norsmile %}
Doing volunteer work is truly admirable.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mitsuru blushjoy %}
Ehehe. I got praised again! Picking up litter is amazing~
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Subaru curious %}
Picking up litter…? Ah, is this to do with the rumors I’ve been hearing about?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Adonis serious %}
Picking up litter?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Subaru norsmile %}
I heard it from Shinonon. Apparently, if you pick up litter, your fortune increases.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Adonis norsmile %}
Hm, how intriguing. I’ll try to put it into practice, as well.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Eichi %}
Why hello there, everyone. I see you’re all here.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Eichi curious %}
…Why are you weeding? Is that what we’ll be doing today?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki %}
Ah, no, we were just doing it while waiting for everyone.

Tenma-kun. Everyone’s arrived now, so let’s stop here.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mitsuru %}
Wait a sec. I’ll put all the weeds into the garbage bag… There!

I’ll go throw it at the garbage dump, so go ahead and decide what we’ll do ‘til I’m back! See ya soon!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki smilesoft %}
Mhm, be careful not to trip over yourself!

Right then. Any ideas or activities you’d all like to try for today?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Eichi grin %}
I certainly do. I’d like to play ‘tag and kick the can’ game with this empty can.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Subaru idle %}
‘Tag and kick the can’? What’s different about it from the usual ‘kick the can’ game?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Eichi smileexplain %}
Fufu. That truly is the first thought that comes to mind, isn’t it? I believe I asked the same question to Wataru when I first heard it.

The rules are simple. First, someone kicks the can, then everyone has to hide somewhere before the person who’s “it” brings the kicked can back to its original spot.

If the person who’s “it” finds and tags all the hidden players, they win. If the empty can is kicked again while they’re searching for everyone, they lose.

It’s like a game that mixes tag, hide-and-seek, and can-kicking and then divides them into three.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Adonis northinking %}
Hm… Setting aside the players who hide, the person who’s “it” would have their stamina put to the test. I worry about Tenshouin-senpai’s physical condition.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Eichi %}
I appreciate your concern, but I was fine when I played it with everyone in <em>fine</em>, and I’d rather you don’t treat me like I’m a sick patient.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Eichi srsthinking %}
Still, all of you have far too much stamina compared to the ordinary person, and I tend to accidentally overdo it whenever I try to match up to your pace.

So I don’t want to strain myself, either. What should we do…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki smilesoft %}
It just means you shouldn’t be “it”, Tenshouin. I think you’ll still be able to have fun without any problems if you only have to hide.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Subaru nod %}
Mhm, mhm. And even if we take turns being “it”, that still makes it four rounds of fun. Sounds good to me!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Adonis norsmile2 %}
I have no objections. We just need to hear from Tenma now—
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mitsuru smileconfident %}
I’m back! Heyhey, so what did you guys decide to play?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Adonis norsmile %}
‘Tag and kick the can’ game. The winner is decided based on whether the person who’s “it” finds everyone, or if one of the people hiding kicks the empty can in time—
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mitsuru sad4 %}
Empty can…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki idle %}
What’s wrong, Tenma-kun?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mitsuru worried %}
Empty cans are litter, so I’m kinda against kicking ‘em. It feels like we’re making more litter, and I don’t want that.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki norsmile %}
Hm… I’m not sure if we can assume it’s litter just yet. Even empty cans can be turned into a Sentai Robot model with enough creativity, and what’s more—

It can be used as a tool to play, like for the ‘tag and kick the can’ game. As long as we collect it afterwards, it won’t be as if we left litter around.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mitsuru %}
Ohh… I keep picking up empty cans so I just assumed they were always litter. My bad!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mitsuru fist %}
I’ll play the ‘tag and kick the can’ game too! Tell me more about the rules!
{% endbubble %}

<div class="msr-narration">
    <p>Several minutes later…</p>
</div>

{% bubble Chiaki smile %}
—Alright then, we’ll decide on who will be “it”. Rock, paper, scissors!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mitsuru grin %}
I win! I’ll be the first “it”!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki curious %}
Who will kick the can? Tenma-kun can run fast, so I think we’d have an exciting game if it’s kicked as far away as possible.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Subaru grin %}
Then Occhan’s the best for this, right? He’s in the Track &amp; Field Club, so I bet he’d be good at it! ☆
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Eichi curious %}
Well, I could understand if he was in the Soccer Club, but I don’t feel like that skill has much to do with Track &amp; Field.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Adonis smilesoft %}
That’s true. However, I’m confident in my leg muscles. I’ve been training my body, after all.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Eichi snicker %}
I see. Then let’s see what you’ve got, hm?

I’ll place it on the ground… Right, go ahead.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Adonis norsmile %}
Got it. Tenma, are you ready?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mitsuru smug %}
Mhm! Bring it on!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Adonis %}
Then here goes—

Hn—!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Subaru surprised %}
Woah— It was sent flying out of Seisoukan Dorms like a shooting star!?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mitsuru fist %}
Aaalright, I’m gonna go find it and come back! Dash, dash~♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Eichi curious %}
…I didn’t think it’d be sent flying that far. You’ve got an outstanding level of leg strength, don’t you?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Adonis worried %}
I’m sorry. Maybe I should’ve held back my strength…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki fist %}
No, this is Tenma-kun we’re talking about, so he should be back in a flash.

Now then, let’s all hide wherever we like! Commence: Sports Survivors activity time…☆
{% endbubble %}

## Happy☆Cycle 3

<div class="msr-narration">
    <p>Ten minutes later…</p>

{% bubble Chiaki northinking %}
<th>(Mm~ Tenma-kun’s taking quite some time… Is he still looking for the empty can?)</th>

<th>(He could just come back if he’s genuinely struggling to find it—)</th>
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki frown %}
<th>(…No, then the empty can really <em>will</em> become litter. He’s been so eager to pick up litter all this time, so I’m sure he’s been doing all he can to find it.)</th>

<th>(In that case, another reason he’s taking a while could be—)</th>
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Adonis idle %}
…Morisawa-senpai, may I speak to you for a moment?

I’m worried about Tenma, since he still hasn’t returned. I’d like to go and see if everything’s alright, considering I’m the one who kicked the can.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki idle %}
Mm. I was just thinking about that too.

Our only clue is the direction the can flew towards. Maybe we could split up and look for him…?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Adonis sightired %}
It’s all because I kicked the can too hard. I’m so sorry.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki smilesoft %}
Don’t worry so much about it. You put your all into it, and nobody will blame you for that.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Eichi smile %}
Yes. This is fun in its own way; it’s like a game of tag where we chase after a moving target.

Right then, how shall we catch Tenma-kun? ♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Subaru %}
Ah, you’re all here! Are you guys thinking of looking for the Dash-Dash Kid?

I had a feeling we might, so I brought over a teammate! Well, more like team-dog? Anyway, tadaaah~☆
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Adonis norsmile2 %}
Ah, Daikichi?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Subaru nod %}
A dog’s sense of smell is ten-something times stronger than a person’s, after all~ Daikichi should be able to find him in no time! ♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki grin %}
Ah, I see. You’re so clever, Akehoshi, bringing a dog over on such short notice!

We’re counting on you, Daikichi! ☆
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Eichi idle %}
I heard police dogs need to rely on scent to trace criminals, but does Daikichi-kun not need a clue like that?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Subaru shocked %}
Ah, I almost forgot about that.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Subaru curious %}
Does anyone have something that has the Dash-Dash Kid’s smell on it?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Adonis %}
Scent… How about sniffing the place where he did the weeding?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Subaru sighfrown %}
…Mm~ It’s not clicking to him, I think. Sorry that this isn’t coming to so much use.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki grin %}
Akehoshi, Daikichi, don’t look so sad. It’s reassuring enough to have more allies!

Plus, even if it’ll be impossible for us, a dog should be able to catch up to Tenma’s fierce dashing! ☆

The can flew over that way. Let’s all head over to that area first.
{% endbubble %}

    <p>Thirty minutes later — The roadside of trees near the ES building…</p>
</div>

{% bubble Adonis serious %}
Hm… We reached the roadside with no sign of anything.

I just hope we didn’t pass by him on our way here…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Eichi northinking %}
This place has a wide clear view, and since four people with a dog are scouting the area, I would say the likelihood of that is low.

If we haven’t found him by now, then I can’t help but suspect something may have happened.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Subaru curious %}
Daikichi~ You can’t tell where the Dash-Dash Kid is? …It’s impossible without his scent?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Subaru sigh %}
Man, if this was a TV drama, this would be the exact moment when a clue like a handkerchief or socks would be found lying around here~…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki srsthinking %}
A clue…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki smileconfident %}
Ah, I know; what if he tries to search by using the scent of our practice outfits?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Subaru %}
Ohh, yeah! We’re all using the same detergent, so it might work.

C’mon, c’mon, Daikichi! Look for this scent! ☆
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Adonis norsmile %}
Oh, he’s already found a sign. Let’s follow him.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Eichi %}
…Found him, he’s over there.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki grin %}
You’re right. Heeey~ Tenma-kun! ☆
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mitsuru shocked %}
Ah, you guys…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki %}
You’re picking up litter here, too? Impressive, truly admirable!

But you shouldn’t leave without telling us, y’know? You’ll have everyone worried.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mitsuru worried %}
Uuu, sorry. I saw some litter where I found the empty can, and couldn’t ignore it…

All the litter everywhere kept bugging me, so I got caught up in picking ‘em all up.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Adonis curious %}
Is all the litter in that trash bag what you picked up, Tenma?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mitsuru %}
Mhm. I’ve been keeping garbage bags in my pocket so I can pick up litter any time.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Subaru curious %}
I didn’t really think much about it but… There sure is a lot of litter around, huh.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mitsuru nod %}
Yeah! It makes it worthwhile to pick ‘em all up!

Here’s the empty can for the ‘tag and kick the can’ game! I wanna pick up litter, so you guys play together for today.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Subaru awkward %}
I mean, even if we could, that’s kiiindaaa~?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Adonis norsmile %}
I’m not very much in the mood to play right now, it would feel as though I’m ignoring the litter everywhere. I’ll pick them up with you.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Eichi smileexplain %}
Shall I arrange for a cleaning service? That way we wouldn’t have to dirty our hands, and it would make the place spotless in a reliable fashion.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki smilesoft %}
Haha, that’s just like you, Tenshouin. But that’ll be unnecessary.

I want to treasure Tenma-kun’s feelings of wanting to clean the place.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mitsuru fist %}
Yeah! I wanna pick ‘em up by myself!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Eichi curious %}
Huh, I see. Well, cleaning up is good conduct, and it helps give a good public impression, so I have no objections to picking up litter.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Eichi frown %}
However, I find it a little unfortunate that our private circle activities could become something like a job.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mitsuru sightired %}
Uuu… I’m sorry for wasting our circle activity time on this…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Subaru norsmile %}
It’s not your fault, Dash-Dash Kid. The ones who’re most at fault are the people who throw litter on the streets.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Adonis smilesoft2 %}
Yeah. Those who should be ashamed of their actions are the ones littering — Tenma’s deeds are actually wonderful.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mitsuru worried %}
Thanks, Suba-chan-senpai\~, Ado-chan-senpai\~
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki norsmile2 %}
…Hey, Tenshouin.

If picking up litter turns into something sports-like, wouldn’t it be alright to consider it a circle activity too?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Eichi norsmile %}
Oh? Do you have an idea by any chance?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki grin %}
Yep. I remembered the perfect sport for this.
{% endbubble %}

## Happy☆Cycle 4

{% bubble Mitsuru curious %}
The perfect sport?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki fist %}
Yeah. It’s called “litter-picking sport”!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki smilesoft %}
I participated in a variety program the other day, and I learned about it there. It was part of the program as a new-generation sport, and—

There’s a movement to promote making a habit out of a healthy lifestyle and recycling by looking at litter cleanup as a form of sports.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki grin %}
Not only do you get to move your body, but you also keep the neighborhood clean. The perfect two birds with one stone…☆
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Adonis norsmile %}
Ohh. Because of all the bending down, picking up litter would also act as a stretching exercise, so it would be good for the body.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Eichi norsmile %}
I’m intrigued. Could you explain the rules?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki smileconfident %}
It seems the points are determined pretty specifically, based on the weight and type of litter you pick up, but…

Let’s split into two teams for today, and make it a match to see who can collect the most litter by the evening. That’s more simple and clear! ☆
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mitsuru nod %}
Mhm, mhm! I prefer something easy to understand!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mitsuru shocked %}
Ah, but splitting into two teams with five people is tricky. One team will be bigger.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Subaru grin %}
Then, then! Let’s make Dakichi a temporary Sports Survivors member!

How about Daikichi joins the same team I do? It’ll be a group of three that way! ☆
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Eichi %}
That’s fine by me. Including a dog in the headcount sounds like a fun idea.

Since Subaru-kun and Daikichi-kun will be on the same team, that means one more person has to join.

In which case, let’s decide through rock-paper-scissors who that will be.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mitsuru smile %}
Let’s go~! Rock, paper, scissors! ☆
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki grin %}
Looks like it’s going to be me with Akehoshi. Let’s do our best, you two!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Subaru fist %}
Mhm! Let’s do this, Chi~chan-senpai!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mitsuru grinsoft %}
Ado-chan-senpai, Ei-chan-senpai, let’s do our best!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Adonis norsmile %}
Yeah. It calms my heart to see public spaces clean.

Since we’re competing, we can’t avoid having a winner by the end, but still — I’d like to put my efforts into making the area beautiful without fixating too much on winning.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Eichi norsmile2 %}
True. If we simply wanted to win, we could pick up only the large pieces of litter, but that would be trivializing our true task of cleaning up the neighborhood.

As Otogari-kun says, let’s focus on making the place beautiful.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mitsuru nod %}
Mhm, mhm! It’s the tiny litter that nobody pays attention to that should be picked up most! Let’s gather lots of ‘em and get our fortune up~!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki smileconfident %}
We’ll meet back at the Seisoukan Dorm’s courtyard. Right, time to split up…☆
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki smilesoft %}
Aaalright, Akehoshi, Daikichi! It’s time to pick up litter!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Subaru northinking %}
Looks like the Dash-Dash Kid picked up all the litter here. There’s not even a scrap of paper around.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki norsmile %}
Sounds like we need to go someplace else. How about the shopping district?[^3]
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Subaru curious %}
Eh~? I feel like the store clerks there would be the type to clean that place up diligently, though…?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Subaru grin %}
Hey, hey, what about the park? It’s pretty spacious there, and Daikichi will get to do his thing as much as he likes! ☆
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki fist %}
Yeah! Let’s run over to the park then!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Subaru smileconfident %}
Chi\~chan-senpai, Daikichi! Let’s have a race to the park\~! Woosh\~☆
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mitsuru nod %}
Suba-chan-senpai and Chia-chan-senpai look like they’re having so much fun! I’m gonna run with them too!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mitsuru surprised %}
…Woah!? Mm, Ado-chan-senpai lifted me up like a mikoshi…?[^4]
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Adonis %}
You can’t go after them. You’re in our team, aren’t you, Tenma?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mitsuru grin %}
Ahaha, woops! ♪

Alrighty! Suba-chan-senpai said this already, but I already picked up the litter here, so let’s go someplace else.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Eichi %}
Right. While we head somewhere else, let’s pick up the litter the other team failed to notice by running off.
{% endbubble %}

<div class="msr-location">

<div class="msr-narration">
    <p>A while later…</p>
</div>

{% bubble Subaru grin %}
We’re here\~! Righty, let’s pick up loads of litter\~☆
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki northinking %}
Straws, paper cups, and this here’s a paper bag…

It’s likely because this spot is used a lot for resting, but there’s a lot of fast food litter around, huh.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Subaru %}
Yeah, there’s a lot of families on days off especially.

There’s a garbage bin here, and I’ve seen it piled up to the brim before.

…Oh, Daikichi? What’s up?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Subaru nod %}
You picked up a plastic bottle? Great job\~! Pat, pat, pat\~♪

I sometimes notice it when I take Daikichi on a walk, but now that I’m paying attention to it, I realize just how much you can find~
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Subaru yare %}
But I feel kinda conflicted somehow… Y’know, being happy about finding so much litter.

I mean, wouldn’t it be better if I *didn’t* find any at all?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki norsmile %}
True, an area with no signs of litter would be the ideal. But the reality is that there’s plenty all over.

That’s exactly why *we’ll* pick up all the litter and make the park clean. We’ll make it so that it’s an ‘area with no signs of litter’ with our own two hands.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Subaru norsmile3 %}
Huh. So I guess it’s fine to be happy about finding litter, yeah?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki grin %}
Yeah. It’s really so admirable of you to notice every single piece of litter here~
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Subaru worried %}
Jeez~ Don’t hug me outta nowhere! So suffocating…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Subaru norsmile2 %}
I picked up all the litter on the grass area. Let’s try going to the woods now.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki smilesoft %}
Could we go to the convenience store before that? I think we’re about to run out of the garbage bags we just bought, so I’d like to stock up on more.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Subaru smileconfident %}
Yupyup, sure~
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki curious %}
It’s not as bad as the turf area, but there’s litter here too, huh…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Subaru grin %}
Yeah, I guess no one really cleans up around here? I can see pretty old litter around.

Look, look! There’s a Potenap bag here! The herb flavor!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki idle %}
Herb flavor?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Subaru %}
You don’t know it, Chi~chan-senpai? Potenap was a popular snack when I was in grade school, and it had a bunch of different flavors.[^5]

And the herb flavor ended its sales immediately~
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki smilesoft %}
Oh? I know about Potenap, but I didn’t know an herb flavor existed.

I would’ve loved to try it.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Subaru awkward %}
I think it’s a good thing you didn’t, actually…? The smell was way too strong, and it had a unique taste to it.

It may have been cheap, but to a grade schooler, just buying one snack was a huge expense, so~
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki smileconfident %}
It’s *because* it wasn’t enjoyed by anyone that makes me wish I could’ve tried it. The people behind the snack released it in hopes of making a profit, right?

Everyone has their own tastes in snacks. It’s possible that the flavor someone doesn’t like would be one that I would…☆
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Subaru norsmile %}
Huh, I see. You’re a pretty strange one after all, Chi~chan-senpai.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki grin2 %}
Fuhaha! I’m happy for the compliment!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Subaru awkward %}
Is that really a compliment…? Well, anyway. It brought back memories, but it’s time I pick up the Potenap bag—

Daikichi, why’re you tugging on my pants? Did you find something?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Subaru norsmile %}
Seems he wants us to follow him. Let’s go, Chi~chan-senpai!
{% endbubble %}

<div class="msr-narration">
    <p>A few minutes later…</p>
</div>

{% bubble Chiaki northinking %}
…Hm. Seems the roots of this tree caught his nose?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Subaru curious %}
Daikichi’s whining to dig here… Maybe something’s buried under there?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki norsmile %}
This reminds me of Hanasaka Jiisan.[^6] Maybe there’s buried treasure.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Subaru nod %}
Treasure? Daikichi’s a sucker for sparkly things, so maybe we’ve struck gold! ☆
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki smile %}
Alright, I’ll do the digging!
{% endbubble %}

{% img https://f005.backblazeb2.com/file/reitoouji/ro_1CMLx6767184dWF5.webp?timestamp=1734809686819 %}

{% bubble Chiaki smile %}
I’ll just tweak the plastic bottle we picked up and… Now we’ve got ourselves a scoop.

I hope we find something in here\~ Dig, dig\~♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Subaru %}
Ooh, amazing, amazing! Dig it up, Chi~chan-senpai! ☆
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki curious %}
…Mm? The scoop hit something.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki serious %}
I think it’s best I gently dig the rest out with my hands. I have to be careful not to injure myself—
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Subaru yare %}
Ehh, it’s just a rusted tin can~

This sucks, you went through all the effort to dig it out, and it just ended up being litter! ‘Kay, here’s the garbage bag.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki norsmile %}
…No. I’ll bury it back in.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Subaru idle %}
Mm, why?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki norsmile %}
It’s hard to tell, but… Look, you see a date with next year written at the bottom of the can, right?

This must be a time capsule someone buried. We can’t just throw it away under the assumption it’s litter.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Subaru curious %}
Mm~ But what if it isn’t a time capsule, and it really is just some random litter?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki smilesoft %}
Then I’ll be sure to collect it. I don’t have an idea in mind how best to approach that, but…

For now, I’ll note down the date on my phone. I’ll check over it again next year.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Subaru norsmile2 %}
…You really do always look out for others, Chi~chan-senpai.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki idle %}
Mm, did you just say something?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Subaru grin %}
Nope! C’mon, c’mon! Let’s head on to the next piece of litter to pick up…☆
{% endbubble %}

    <p>Meanwhile, in Season Avenue…</p>
</div>

{% bubble Mitsuru blushjoy %}
Yaaay, Ei-chan-senpai’s prediction was super duper right on the mark!

The downtown area has loads of litter! It’s like a mountain of treasure in my eyes~!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Adonis norsmile %}
I was worried there’d be a crowd of uproar to seeing idols picking up litter, but—

It seems that worry was unnecessary. Everyone is watching us with consideration.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mitsuru grin %}
Even better, some people are helping us pick up the litter! I’m super duper thankful beyond words~!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mitsuru smilesoft %}
When I learned that “to pick up litter is to pick up fortune”, I wanted to keep it all to myself at first…

But picking up litter with everyone is so much fun! It feels so good to see the town become sparkly clean!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Eichi %}
Mhm. We can accomplish so much more if we work together with a great number of people, and a clean town means a place that anyone can feel happy in.

This sense of accomplishment is possibly something that wouldn’t be attainable all on your own.

Oh? I see something…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mitsuru curious %}
A news camera…? Is someone reporting right now?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Adonis serious %}
It must be a street interview. I see them a lot around this time of day.

…It seems that they’d like to interview us about why we’re picking up litter. What should we do?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Eichi srsthinking %}
Mm~… Considering my position, I’d rather refrain from making a comment on camera…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Eichi norsmile %}
Is it possible I leave this to you, Tenma-kun? You’re the one who’s most enthusiastic about picking up litter, after all.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mitsuru fist %}
Got it! Then I’ll talk on behalf of all of us!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mitsuru northinking %}
<th>(If I mention who I am and the unit I’m part of, it might be seen as promotion…? So I should just do it normally, like—)</th>
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mitsuru grin %}
Hello! This is just a personal thing, so it’s nothing special to introduce myself for! ☆

Yep yep, this isn’t for a TV program, we’re just picking up litter ‘cuz we wanna!

…”How admirable of you”? Ehehe, thank you!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mitsuru smilesoft %}
The reason the town becomes clean is ‘cuz people we don’t even know the names of pick up the litter for us.

That’s why I’d be so happy if everyone else picks up any litter they find. Even if each of us picks up just one piece of litter, the town will eventually turn sparkly clean, and it’ll feel so good!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mitsuru fist %}
Everyone will be smiling by the end! That’d be the best “fortune pick up” ever! ☆

The Tenma, Otogari, and Tenshouin team! Congrats!

Yaaay, we did it!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Subaru grin %}
Dash-Dash Kid, Occhan, Eichi-senpai! Congrats, congrats, congrats…!! ☆

{% bubble Adonis curious %}
…Is it really alright for us to be seen as the winners?

Unlike the two of you who worked hard with a dog in your team, we had the help of the pedestrians in town. Wouldn’t that be unfair?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki smilesoft %}
Don’t sweat the details! In the end, we managed to pick up this much litter.

While victory and defeat were decided here, in reality, everyone won the championship…☆
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mitsuru nod %}
Mhm, mhm! Everyone worked hard, so everyone is so admirable!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mitsuru curious %}
…Ei-chan-senpai, was today fun?

I’m worried we pushed you to do something you didn’t wanna do~
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Eichi smilesoft2 %}
Not to worry. I had plenty of fun, as well.

I was able to approach it at my own pace, and it <em>is</em> a pretty nice sport in my opinion.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Eichi smile %}
It’s time for dinner, and there’s been growling of stomachs for a while now. As for Daikichi-kun, I’ll give him delicious hotdogs as a present at a later date—

So how about we all change into our casual wear and go have a meal? ♪

Keep in mind we can always order more if it isn’t enough, so for now, make whatever order you like.

{% bubble Chiaki idle %}
…Tenshouin, are you sure about treating me to something, too?

I’m also an adult here. I can pay for myself, y’know?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Eichi grin %}
Fufu. It’s repayment for letting me experience something wonderful. I’d love you to be frank and accept the offer.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki worried %}
Still…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Subaru smilesoft %}
Take him up on his offer, Chi~chan-senpai. Eichi-senpai is super rich, so he wouldn’t feel a thing from this!

Let’s have fun getting ourselves a treat~♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki srsthinking %}
Hm… I suppose that’s true.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki smile %}
Then I’ll accept your offer without hesitation! ☆
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Adonis norsmile %}
They brought over our food. Everything looks so tasty.

I see that Tenma’s having the same hamburger steak meal as me. Meat is superb. Eat lots and grow strong.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mitsuru nod %}
Mhm! I’ll grow big just like Ado-chan-senpai!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mitsuru curious %}
Mm? They brought over juice, but I didn’t order that…?

Excuse me~! I think there’s been a mistake in the order!

…The juice is on the house? You knew about us picking up litter from the evening news?
{% endbubble %}

…“Thank you for making the town clean”? Ehehe, you’re welcome!

Yaaay, I got treated to juice! That “to pick up litter is to pick up fortune” phrase really is true after all! ☆
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Chiaki norsmile %}
There’s also that, but — In this case, isn’t it virtue being rewarded highly?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mitsuru idle %}
What’s virtual being rewarded highness…?[^7]
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Adonis northinking %}
Highness… Wasn’t someone called that?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Subaru smileconfident %}
You’re thinking of Ohi\~san! Barry\~ calls Ohi\~san “your Highness”.[^8]

So you mean virtual beings rewarded Ohi~san? It’s so cryptic in suuuch a funny way…☆
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Eichi smileexplain %}
Virtue being rewarded highly. It means that good actions will always bring forth good outcomes.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mitsuru fist %}
Ohh~ It’s amazing that the things I did can bring back such big loads of happiness!

Aaalright, I’ll keep doing more of that virtual being rewarded highness from here on out, too…! ☆

## Translation Notes

[^1]: In their first year of school, Ra*bits would often take up part-time school jobs.
[^2]: Subaru calls Mitsuru <em>daze-daze-kko</em> (Daze-daze Kid), based on Mitsuru’s speech quirk to typically end sentences with <em>-daze</em>. I changed it to “Dash-Dash” as an English equivalent, since it’s also a unique trait of Mitsuru.
[^3]: The shopping district is a strip of shops near Yumenosaki Academy, and it's where Takamine Greengrocer is located.
[^4]: Mikoshi, also known as a portable shrine, is typically carried by the shoulder. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mikoshi" target="_blank">See here</a> for images.
[^5]: Potenap was first mentioned in <a href="https://enstarsmasterlist.github.io/scoutevent#Little-Kings" target="_blank">Little Kings</a>, including more context about the several flavors. 
[^6]: Hanasaka Jiisan is a Japanese folktale, where a couple's dog digs up in the garden and finds a box of gold coins. The folktale is summarized on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hanasaka_Jiisan" target="_blank">the wiki page</a>, and fits the theme of this story! 
[^7]: Chiaki says <em>zenin-zenka</em> (善因善果), an idiom that lit. means “good deeds, good results”, but Mitsuru mishears it as <em>zenin-denka</em> (全員殿下), lit. “everyone highness”. I tried to translate it with an English equivalent of the same misunderstanding!
[^8]: This is referring to how Ibara calls Hiyori.
