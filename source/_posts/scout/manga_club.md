{% bubble Mao %}
Ahh~! Crap, crap, crap! I’m gonna be late for class!

Why’s this the one day I forget to set my alarm!? I’m <em>never</em> the type to make this sorta mistake…!

And we <em>just</em> started our week to reduce late arrivals! What’s the point if the Student Council President himself is late!?

Not to mention, we’ve got a really naggy kid who’d rip me a new one if I arrived late…

If I’m ever late — even for just one day — I’ll never hear the end of it for the rest of the year! I can’t let that happen…

Anyway, I need to get to school as fast as possible…!
{% endbubble %}

<div class="msr-location">
    <p><span><b>Location:</b> School Route</span></p>
</div>

{% bubble Mao %}
*Huff… Huff…* O-Okay, I should make it on time…! I’m so gla—

Gaahh!?

Owww… I wasn’t looking ahead of me before turning, and crashed into someone…

Wait—! Enough talking to myself! Is the person okay…!?

Ah! They’re over on the ground there! —A-Are you okay!? I’m so sorry!
{% endbubble %}

{% img /img/es/scoutstory/mangaclub/1_2.jpg %}

{% bubble Keito %}
Guh… This is truly unfortunate…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mao %}
…Umm, Hasumi-senpai… What are you doing?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Keito %}
Incorrigible. Why on <em>earth</em> were you running here!? You have to look before you turn!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mao %}
I’m very sorry about that, I really am… And I know I’m being rude talking like this to a senior, but please let me ask again… <em>What</em> are you doing…?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Keito %}
Huh? “Senior”? *Me?* What have you been on about… Also, I believe it’s quite obvious what I’m doing here.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mao %}
Umm… But I’m asking you <em>because</em> it isn’t obvious…?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Keito %}
<em>Sigh</em>… Very well then, I’ll explain it to you.

I’m clearly on my way to school right now, what else?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mao %}
Eh…?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Keito %}
Mm—! Shoot, I shouldn’t be standing around talking. The first bell is going to ring soon — I have to get to school immediately. I can’t be late on my first day.

Neither of us were injured thankfully, but you better be careful next time. Understood?

Right, good day to you.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mao %}
…………

Did he hit his head? And why did he mention going to school…?

Didn’t he graduate…?
{% endbubble %}

<div class="msr-location">
    <p><span><b>Location:</b> Classroom 3-A</span></p>
</div>

{% img /img/es/scoutstory/mangaclub/1_3.jpg %}

{% bubble Mao %}
*Huff… Huff…* W-Whew, I managed to make it…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Hokuto %}
Good morning, Isara. It’s not like you to be late.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mao %}
Hahh, g’morning… I’m so tired… I haven’t ran this much in a long while…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Makoto %}
Ahaha. But I’m glad you made it just before the class bell.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Subaru %}
Sally~ G’morning! ☆ What happened to you today? Weren’t you trying to be a lot more careful since you became Prez?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mao %}
Ah, well… I forgot to set my alarm, so that’s why I woke up late, but… Honestly, the main reason is ‘cause of something else…

I got caught up with something weird on my way here, y’see~
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Subaru %}
Something weird…? What do you mean?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mao %}
Mm… What <em>was</em> that? How do I even begin to explain what I saw…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Jin %}
Heyy\~ The bell rang, y’know\~ It’s about time you all sat down.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Makoto %}
Hm? Oh, the teacher’s here.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mao %}
Oh, you’re right. Aight, I’ll talk to you guys about it later.

<th>(…Huh? Wait, has Sagami-sensei always been our homeroom teacher this year…?)</th>

<th>(Well, whatever. If he’s here, it obviously means he’s the homeroom teacher, so…)</th>

<th>(Hmm… It feels like weird things just keep happening today…)</th>

<th>(Or I guess, it’s more like an odd feeling has been nagging my mind…)</th>
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Jin %}
We’ve got an important announcement to make today. We’re gonna have a transfer student~ Make sure to get along with her.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mao %}
<th>(Transfer student? Is that about Anzu? …Huh? Who’s Anzu…?)</th>

<th>(No, no, wait. Anzu’s our *producer!* How could I forget who she was for a second there…)</th>

<th>(This just keeps happening… Something’s clouding my head, and it doesn’t feel right…)</th>
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Jin %}
Alright, come on in, transfer student.
{% endbubble %}

{% img /img/es/scoutstory/mangaclub/1_4.jpg %}

{% bubble Keito %}
Nice to meet you all. My name is Hasumi Keito; I’m a new student here. I hope to get along with all of you.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mao %}
Ahh~! It’s the weird Hasumi-senpai I crashed into this morning!

Why’re you enrolling in school!? Didn’t you graduate!? Why’re you back here…!? And why are you cross-dressing; did you lose in a game and end up forced to wear that or something!?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Keito %}
You’re that guy I met this morning…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Jin %}
Oh? You know Isara? Great, then I’ll put you next to him.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mao %}
Please don’t just continue the conversation like everything’s normal! Does nobody realize how weird this all is!?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Keito %}
It seems like it was fate to meet you. I hope we can get along.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mao %}
Huuhh!?

…Actually, now that I think about it, this situation…

Isn’t this just like that trope in romcom manga, where the protagonist crashes into the… girl…? on his way to school, and then finds out she’s the transfer student…?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Keito %}
…♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mao %}
N-No, please! I don’t wanna be in a cliche like thaatttt~!!
{% endbubble %}

## Chapter 2

<div class="msr-location">
    <p><span><b>Location:</b> Dance Room</span></p>
</div>

{% img /img/es/scoutstory/mangaclub/2_1.jpg %}

{% bubble Mao %}
Mm… Mmm~… N-Noooo…!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Eichi %}
My, my, he sounds like he’s having a nightmare. I wonder what he’s witnessing…

Takamine-kun, I’m starting to pity the boy. Could you wake him up for us?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
Fweh? Ah, um, okay.

Isara-senpai, Isara-senpaaai\~! Are you alright\~? I’ll remove the device on you, okay? Please come back to us\~?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mao %}
…Ha—! W-What!? Where’d the classroom go…!? Where’s Hasumi-senpai!?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
Are you still feeling disoriented? Did it feel *that* real? Please snap out of it, we’re in a dance room in ES.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mao %}
…Ah, right. Tenshouin-senpai called us here, and—
{% endbubble %}

<div class="msr-narration">
    <p>One hour ago…</p>
</div>

{% bubble Jun v3 %}
Why did all of us from the Manga Club get told to come here outta the blue…?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tori %}
I’d personally never refuse any call from Eichi-sama, but… I really do wonder why he wanted us here.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mao %}
Would you happen to know why, Hasumi-senpai?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Keito %}
No, I haven’t heard anything myself. Well, I don’t believe it’ll be anything strange, though…

No, never mind; this is him we’re talking about. He might be getting himself carried away with something again.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
Well, as long as it isn’t to do with scolding us… Not that I can even think of anything we could get scolded for.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mao %}
Yeah, no, that can’t be it~ We haven’t done anything wrong during our circle activities—
{% endbubble %}

<div class="msr-narration">
    <p>Door opens</p>
</div>

{% bubble Mao %}
Mm? Ahh, Tenshouin-senpai’s here. Let’s just ask him instead.
{% endbubble %}

{% img /img/es/scoutstory/mangaclub/2_2.jpg %}

{% bubble Eichi %}
Hello, everyone. I’m sorry to ask for your time all of the sudden.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mao %}
No, it’s fine, but… What did you want to tell us? Since all the Manga Club members are here, does that mean it has something to do with our Circle?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Eichi %}
Indeed. I won’t waste our time with casual talk; let’s just head straight to it.

Do you know about the event called “Manga Expo” that’s happening in a month’s time?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mao %}
Manga Expo…? No, this is the first time I’m hearing about it.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Keito %}
I only vaguely know of it. It’s a large-scale manga festival, right? I heard that it’ll be held for three days at the international exhibition.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tori %}
Yeah, I know about it. They wanted to secure funding from my household, but since manga and toys ask for a different type of clientele, my family rejected it.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mao %}
Ohh\~ Feels like a story of the life of a rich household\~ Just like something you’d find in a manga.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tori %}
Yeah, that’s because I <em>am</em> from a rich household. Anyway, my family may have rejected investing in the event, but I’m personally interested in it. I was hoping to check it out.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
There won’t be any mascots at the event, and I don’t really like to go to places with way too many people, but…

I’m kinda interested… I’d also like to check it out, maybe…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Eichi %}
I’m pleased to hear that all of you are interested. ♪ Takamine-kun is typically slow to act, but if he also wishes to go, then I think I can hope for a successful story here.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
Huh?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Eichi %}
You see, the Tenshouin Zaibatsu has invested in Manga Expo. I’d like to make it as successful as possible, for the sake of future plans.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tori %}
Wait, really? Ahh~ I wish my household also invested in it, now…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Eichi %}
Fufu. I think your father’s decision was correct. The sort of customers your household usually deals with are far too different, so I don’t think he would’ve made a profit.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Jun v3 %}
A manga festival is right up my alley, personally. What kinda events do they have?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Eichi %}
Hmm, let’s see… The most notable ones would be the key frame exhibition of popular manga, and an exhibition of all of the old manga magazines.

There’s also a cafe you can hang out in while enjoying all the oldest and latest mangas.

Oh yes, and there’s even a booth to experience how it feels to be the protagonist of a manga in real-time. ♪ Everyone has imagined themselves in that position before, haven’t they?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mao %}
Huh? Experiencing what it’s like to be the protagonist of a manga…? Yeah, I’ve daydreamed of that sorta stuff before, but how will they make that work…?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Eichi %}
Do you all know about SSVRS? It’s a device that allows you to enter a virtual reality.

We made a revised version as an attraction for the event.

Oh, yes. How about all of you try it out? I was planning to do a beta test after our meeting, so I have the prototype with me here. You could attempt a trial run.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mao %}
Huh!?
{% endbubble %}

<div class="msr-narration">
    <p>Mao and Jun exchange glances in silence</p>
</div>

{% bubble Mao %}
Yeah, I’d like to try it out.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Jun v3 %}
I’m also curious~
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Eichi %}
Mhm, seems like everyone’s interest has been piqued.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Jun v3 %}
It’s not every day you can experience the life of a manga protagonist~ So is any manga possible?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Eichi %}
Not every manga per se, but we’ve made sure to compile all sorts of genres people could try out.

I believe I brought my tablet— Ah, yes, here it is.

Right then, choose the genre you’d like to experience through this tablet. Then you simply need to wear these goggles, and you’ll become the protagonist of that genre.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mao %}
Ohh? Let’s see here.

<th>(There’s action, comedy, sci-fi, sports, health, romance, social issues… Oh, even horror. There’s niche genres along with the popular ones, huh~)</th>

<th>(I’d like to be in an action manga… You can’t help but daydream about being in a shounen manga as a guy, so~ Ah, but a romcom sounds fun, too.)</th>

<th>(Mm, I really can’t decide… Which do I go for…?)</th>
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tori %}
Isara-senpai, are you still choosing? We all chose something, so it’s only you left.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mao %}
Wha— You’re all done!? Sorry, sorry…! I’ll choose something now.

Erm, let’s just go with the romcom protagonist. *<th>(presses button)</th>*

Now to wear the goggles…

Mm? I can see text popping up…? Erm…?

“PLAY START”
{% endbubble %}

## Chapter 3

{% bubble Mao %}
…Ahh, right. Tenshouin-senpai called us here, and then we tried out what it’s like to be a manga protagonist.

Whew~… I’m so glad that wasn’t real…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Eichi %}
How’s the refined SSVRS? I’m sure it was fun—

Is what I’d like to say here, but you didn’t seem to enjoy it much, did you?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mao %}
It was more like torture… I felt like I was having a nightmare. I think like, the story gets weird fast when you’re awful at being imaginative or something…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Eichi %}
Oh? Interesting.

Since this trial is part of the beta testing, I’d love to know what sort of story you experienced in order to further improve the technology.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mao %}
Umm… I was going to be late to class, and then—
{% endbubble %}

<div class="msr-narration">
    <p>Time passes…</p>
</div>

{% bubble Keito %}
What on *earth…!* How incorrigible! Don’t involve me in such a ridiculous plot-twist!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mao %}
Nonono! It’s not like I <em>wanted</em> to involve you! I don’t even know why it turned out that way!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tori %}
Eww… Hasumi-senpai cross-dressing sounds groooss…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Jun v3 %}
Hasumi-senpai also suffered from this, huh~… I know it’s just in someone’s head, but I’d hate to know someone was imagining me in a dress.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mao %}
I swear it was outta my control! I hate the thought, too! Also, *I’m* the biggest victim here, ‘kay!?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Keito %}
Quit laughing already, Eichi!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Eichi %}
……<em><th>(Laughing so much that no sound comes out)</th></em>

—Ha, hah… hah… My stomach hurts…

Ahh~ I thought I was going to laugh until I suffocated to death… Hahaha, I’m so envious, Mao. I want to see something as bizarre as that with my very own eyes.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mao %}
Um, I only feel like I experienced torture, though…?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Eichi %}
Well, I suppose that isn’t a terrible way to put it, yes.

However, from what I understood, your experience turned out to be quite peculiar, which I find very interesting.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Keito %}
That’s true. Personally, I experienced something normal.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Eichi %}
Oh? What sort of story did you experience, Keito?
{% endbubble %}

{% img /img/es/scoutstory/mangaclub/keitoorigcg.jpg %}

{% bubble Keito %}
Me? I was a spy infiltrating various facilities, changing disguise at every location until the mission was cleared.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mao %}
Oh! Hasumi-senpai, you chose <em>that</em> manga?[^1] I love it, too! It’s really fun, right? It has all the popular tropes in the best way!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Keito %}
Yeah, I really got to experience something valuable. It truly feels exhilarating to be the protagonist of a story.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mao %}
But I’m surprised; I thought you’d choose something more niche.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Keito %}
I did think to do that at first, but I thought it would be best to go with a popular story to get a feel of the world of a manga.

Plus, with a manga like this, I can experience all types of jobs.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Eichi %}
That’s Keito for you; he treats it like an internship. So? How did the climax of your story go?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Keito %}
Mm, I don’t know if there was anything like that… It was pretty normal, actually.

It was quite a realistic mission to have in that world’s standards, so there was no huge plot-twist anywhere.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Eichi %}
I see. What about the others? Did you experience anything strange or out of the blue in your storylines?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tori %}
Nope, nothing weird from mine, Eichi-sama.

As for me! I was a super experienced radiographer, working on the job in the coolest fashion! Everyone kept asking for my help day in and out~ I had so much to do!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
Radiographer…? I mean, that’s definitely impressive, but… It’s not the first job that comes to mind, I guess? Wouldn’t a doctor have been a better choice…?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tori %}
You’re so naive, Takamine! What if I had to perform a surgery!? I’d have to look at <em>blood</em>, y’know! That’s terrifying! I’d faint if I had to do that!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
Ahh, that’s why you avoided being a doctor… I feel you there. I’d also be way too terrified to use a scalpel…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tori %}
Right? Anyway, what genre did you choose, Takamine?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
If I were to put it in one word, it’d be “heaven”…?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tori %}
Wha? The heck kinda genre is that? I’ve never heard of it…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
I think the genre is “mascot characters”…? I was with three cute, small animals, taking out weeds, subjugating others, eating snacks, and having a relaxing life.[^2]

Well, I did freak out when they suddenly told me to go on a subjugating spree with them…

But once we went off to do the deed, the scary monsters were all so strange-looking that they also wound up looking cute.

I was in a world filled with cute stuff everywhere — Ahh, just remembering it feels like I’m back in heaven…♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tori %}
Another mascot character-related manga? You really never change~ You’re always typical ol’ Takamine.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
Haah~…♪

I wanted to bring them back with me, but I couldn’t, since it’s just VR… It’s a shame…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tori %}
That’s just kidnapping, y’know. That’s really bold to say…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mao %}
Ahaha… What about you, Sazanami? What did you choose?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Jun v3 %}
Me? I chose a popular one like Hasumi-senpai.
{% endbubble %}

## Chapter 4

{% bubble Jun v3 %}
I was a soldier training to fight against these huge aliens that were invading the country.[^3]

It’s nice to train as a team~ Feels like everyone gets to help each other grow, and it’s lotsa fun.

I used to always just train all on my own when I was young, so I never really had any fun doing it—

Mm? Why’s everyone looking at me like that?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tori %}
I can’t <em>believe</em> you’d wanna work your butt off in a dream world. I’d never go for that sort of thing.

Actually, if that’s something you already experienced when you were young, you should’ve gone for a different manga.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Jun v3 %}
Oh, but this is one of my favorite mangas, y’know~? Ever since I read it, I always wondered what it’d be like to train the same way the characters did in the manga.

And anyway, what’s wrong with that? I enjoyed it a lot in the end.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mao %}
Hold on! Objection!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
Wha—!? Why’d you yell out of nowhere…? Please don’t do that, you freaked me out…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mao %}
Why did everyone get to enjoy such a normal manga scenario when I got <em>that</em> for mine!?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tori %}
How should I know…? Umm, maybe it has to do with the sort of person each of us are…?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mao %}
But I’m always a highly moral guy, aren’t I!? Right, Tori!?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tori %}
W-Woah! Don’t whine to me just because you didn’t get what you wanted!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Eichi %}
Hmm… Perhaps the refined SSVRS I gave you has a malfunction in it, Mao.

That may be why it glitched and added real-life elements in.

I’ll do a thorough check-up on yours, just in case.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mao %}
Ugh, I’m really dumb out of luck if that’s the case…

Oh well, I’ll just consider it a valuable experience and move on. I guess I’ll try it again when the real thing comes out if I’m that curious.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Jun v3 %}
Yeah, it’d be nice to check out the event as part of our Manga Club activities.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mao %}
Yeah, you’re right~

Alright then, Tenshouin-senpai, thank you for today.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Eichi %}
Hold on a moment. I haven’t finished with the main topic.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mao %}
Huh? Didn’t you want us to test your refined SSVRS?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Eichi %}
Didn’t I clearly mention that there will be an official beta test once we’re done here?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mao %}
Oh yeah, you did…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Keito %}
Then why did you really gather us here?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Eichi %}
I’d like you, Manga Club, to participate in the Ultimate Manga Quiz Showdown. It’s going to happen at Manga Expo.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Keito %}
“Ultimate Manga Quiz Showdown”…?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
What’s that…?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Eichi %}
It’s as the name stands: You answer a quiz about manga.

Your opponent will be a Quiz Master Club from a prestigious university. The management team wishes to hold a showdown to see who would win between quiz enthusiasts and manga enthusiasts.

I’d like you all to participate as the manga enthusiasts team.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
Wha…? This is so sudden, though…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mao %}
It really is. Plus, we’re just a bunch of guys who like manga, we’re not actually specialized in it or anything…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Jun v3 %}
Yeah, those types of people know the dialogue by heart… Isn’t it more appropriate to make <em>actual</em> hardcore fans participate?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
I like reading manga, but there’s no way I could do a quiz on it in front of a whole audience…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Keito %}
Indeed… I feel as though this is too burdensome on us, Eichi.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tori %}
Wh— Hey! Why’re you all refusing his offer just like that!? He asked us so kindly, y’know!?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mao %}
Yeah but, do <em>you</em> feel confident that you can win against quiz enthusiasts, Tori?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tori %}
Uu— Um… well… No, but…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mao %}
Yeah, that’s not surprising.

Tenshouin-senpai, I know it’s a big opportunity and all, but I think we’ll pass — It doesn’t seem possible…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Eichi %}
I see… What a shame. Even though the winner can receive <em>such</em> a huge, grand prize…

I suppose you’ll just throw that chance away all over a lack of confidence… Ahh, what a waste.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mao %}
Huh? A prize?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
Now that you’ve mentioned it, I’m really curious to know what it is…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Keito %}
Eichi… Enough with the roundabout way of speaking. It’s unfair to hide information from us in a negotiation.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tori %}
What’s the prize, Eichi-sama?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Eichi %}
Fufu. You see, we plan to invite a certain manga artist to the stage as a guest. The winners will receive an autograph signed first-hand by the artist.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mao %}
Wha—!?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Eichi %}
It’s a very popular artist, actually. He apparently draws a manga about pirates.

I don’t really know much, but surely you folks would know?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Jun v3 %}
Whaaa!? Are you *serious!?*
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tori %}
O-Oh gosh…! Really!? I’m a huge fan of that manga~!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mao %}
Do manga fans who *aren’t* a fan of his even exist!?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
Anyone who’s read manga has definitely read that story before.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Keito %}
I see… So he’s going to come as a guest. Just being able to greet him would be a valuable experience of its own.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Eichi %}
Ahh, I see you all have a fire lit in your hearts now. What a relief. I ask again just to be sure, but—

—You’ll all participate in the Ultimate Manga Quiz Showdown, won’t you?
{% endbubble %}

## Chapter 5

<div class="msr-location">
    <p><span><b>Location:</b> ES Hallway</span></p>
</div>

{% img /img/es/scoutstory/mangaclub/5_1.jpg %}

{% bubble Keito %}
I feel as though Eichi had us in the palm of his hand, but…

Oh well. Now that we’re participating in the competition, we need to do our absolute best. First, we need a plan.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Jun v3 %}
That means training then, right~? Like, the test play reminded me of this, but… It’s the standard way to face hardships in a shounen manga, isn’t it?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
*Sigh…* That sorta overbearing stuff is a <em>pain</em>, though… But it’s better than going on stage without preparation and embarrassing ourselves, I guess.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tori %}
Training sounds good, but where could we do that? We need a place that has manga, right? Do you wanna do it in the dorm’s library, then? Only problem is that there’s not a lot of manga there.

{% bubble Jun v3 %}
Mmm… The library only has new manga series, so it won’t help us much, will it? A quiz is gonna have trivia questions from all generations.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mao %}
Then let’s do it at my house~
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
Huh? Isara-senpai’s home?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mao %}
Yep. I’ve got a bunch with me, even the older ones. And my li’l sis has the shojo manga with her.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tori %}
Ohh? Sounds good to me. We could just do it at Isara-senpai’s house then.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Keito %}
Is that really alright, though? Won’t we be a bother to your family?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mao %}
Ritsu would always come over and chill at my house more than anyone, so you don’t have to worry about that!

But my room isn’t that big, so please bear with the tight space.
{% endbubble %}

    <p>Next day…</p>
</div>

{% bubble Mao %}
I know it’s cramped with this many people here, but still, make yourself at home.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tori %}
Sure~ Ooh, so this is your room, huh? It’s even smaller than my house’s bathtub.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mao %}
B-Bathtub!? How big is that bathtub…? Your house is seriously way too big, dude! This is what a normal house is usually like, okay?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
Ohh, you really do have a lot of manga on your bookshelf.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Jun v3 %}
As expected of Isara-san~ There’s a lot here.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Keito %}
Yeah, and there are various genres to choose from, as well.

However, it’s still too little for the quiz. How can we make up for that…?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mao %}
Oh, I actually have way more than this. I couldn’t fit them in my bookshelf, so I stored the rest in the closet.

I’ll bring them over. Wait one second.
{% endbubble %}

<div class="msr-narration">
    <p>Time passes…</p>
</div>

{% bubble Jun v3 %}
Woah… Yeah, with this many, even quiz newbies like us could stand a chance.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mao %}
Right? Let’s work through all the manga I have first, then we’ll think of other manga we could study up on if we still have time before the quiz.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Keito %}
That sounds good. We can do this the same way you would with efficient studying — Let’s thoroughly read the manga, and answer questions at the end.

That’s how we can learn best. I’ll prepare the questions for the quiz.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mao %}
Aaalright! Let’s do this! Let’s win the quiz championship, and get that autograph! Hip-hip-hurray~! ☆
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble JunTori %}
Hurray~! ☆
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
H-Hurray~… Uuu, please be gentle on me… I hate studying enough as it is…
{% endbubble %}

<div class="msr-narration">
    <p>Time passes…</p>
</div>

{% bubble Jun v3 %}
—Aight! I got through ‘em~
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tori %}
C’mon, you gotta ask the questions *now!* I feel like I’m gonna forget all the information any second now~!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mao %}
Alright then, please lay it on us, Hasumi-senpai!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Keito %}
Right, first question—
{% endbubble %}

<div class="msr-narration">
    <p>Time passes…</p>
</div>

{% bubble Keito %}
This is the last question.

What is the title of the 21st volume for Pirates of Treasure?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
Ehh!? I don’t remember *that…!*
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tori %}
Titlee~..!? I remember that volume, but there’s no way I’d remember a specific *title!*
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Jun v3 %}
I do remember seeing it, though… Umm, what was it… “Desire,” or something…?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Keito %}
Unfortunately, that’s incorrect.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mao %}
I think the “Desire” title was for the 22nd volume. Hmm, what was it~… I feel like I saw it too…

It had a pretty cover and everything… And considering the plot of that volume, I’m guessing it’d be… “Shangri-la”?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Keito %}
You were close, but still incorrect. The correct answer is “Utopia”.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mao %}
Wha? Really?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tori %}
Gimme the 21st volume for a second… Umm, we should see the title in the table of contents, right? —Ahh, here it is.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mao %}
Lemme see — Ohh, it really does say “Utopia”.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tori %}
Gosh, this is *impossible~!* How are we supposed to remember that kinda stuff!?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
*Sigh…* This is way too tough…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Keito %}
Hmm, we got through the whole quiz, but… The answer rate was about 30%. And this was just practice, too. We’re likely to only get around 17% in the actual quiz.

I noticed this while we were doing the quiz, but it feels as though our accuracy lowered as we were reaching the end.

Which means the information hasn’t stuck in your head. You all kept making careless mistakes, too.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tori %}
That’s not our fault! I may love manga, but there’s no way I could learn all this info in such a short amount of time…!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Jun v3 %}
I think we needa think up another way to do this. Trying to master all these different genres at once doesn’t seem to be working well in our favor.
{% endbubble %}

## Chapter 6

{% bubble Midori %}
But… What are we supposed to do then…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mao %}
Mmm…

<th>(Ah! Wait, that’s right… The competition’s rules had something to it—)</th>

Hasumi-senpai, do you remember the quiz’s rules?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Keito %}
Rules? If I recall correctly, two teams of five will compete against each other. If one member is correct, you gain one point; if all members are correct, you gain five points.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mao %}
Okay, good, I wasn’t misremembering. Right, then let’s just throw away those five points.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tori %}
*What!?* That’s so not like you. Are you saying to give up on winning?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mao %}
Nah, just hear me out for a sec.

The only reason we’re trying to remember trivia about every kind of genre is ‘cause we were trying to aim for a five-member correct answer. And that’s making us not remember <em>anything</em>, right?

We won’t have any chance to win then.

So let’s split the workload instead. How about we all get really good at our best genre or manga, and try to get a lot of correct answers individually?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Jun v3 %}
So in other words… We should aim for solo points over five points at once?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Keito %}
Oh, that would be a good plan… We could definitely work with split roles based on our speciality. It’s a much better plan than forcing ourselves to remember everything.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
It’d be way easier on me to remember stuff about what I like… so this would help me out, I think.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mao %}
Right? So it’s settled then!

Let’s fill our brains up with info ‘til the day of the event! We can do this~!
{% endbubble %}

<div class="msr-location">

<div class="msr-narration">
    <p>Day of the Manga Expo…</p>
</div>

{% bubble Keito %}
Excuse me— Mm? All of you are here — Ah, except for Isara, it seems.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Jun v3 %}
Ah, hello. Isara-san went to have a meeting about the event along with the staff.

It’s a simplistic meeting, though, so he’ll be back soon enough.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Keito %}
I see. We can consider ourselves all here, then. How admirable of you all — You’re early to our appointed meeting.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Jun v3 %}
Well, I wasn’t sure what sorta event we’re gonna be in, so I came earlier just in case.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tori %}
I came earlier to sneak around the place and check it out~

Except it’s waaay too crowded to do that in a rush… There’s lines everywhere, so I wouldn’t make it in time for the quiz if I queued up.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
Me too… I was hoping I could check out all the booths I researched. I even planned out which ones I’d go to first… I didn’t expect this to be such a large-scale event…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mao %}
Man~ It’s so crowded… You can hear the noise from backstage… Are we seriously gonna have a quiz in front of all these people?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Keito %}
Hm? Hello, Isara. Good work.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mao %}
Oh! You’re here too, Hasumi-senpai. Good morning.

Heeey, I got the script right here, so let’s go over it before the real thing starts.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Keito %}
I asked a staff member on my way here, and the seats are apparently all sold out. There are a lot of people here just for this quiz.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
Wh—? Crap, that’s so nerve-wracking… I really thought I’d be able to check the place out, go to the quiz, and that’s that…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Keito %}
There’s no need to be so nervous. You aren’t competing alone, are you? We’re all comrade-in-arms here.

Also, as the one who guided all of you throughout your training, I can confidently say that you’ve all worked really hard to be capable of putting up a good fight.

Now you only need to remember your training and go all out.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tori %}
We’ve come all the way here, I don’t wanna lose now! I wanna go home knowing we won big!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mao %}
Yeah! Let’s give it all we’ve got so we can head home with the big prize~!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble JunTori %}
Yeah~!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
Uu… I’m not good with this stuff, but I worked so hard training for this, so… I’ll do the best I can…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mao %}
Right then, it’s about time we go!
{% endbubble %}

<div class="msr-location">
    <p><span><b>Location:</b> Manga Expo Stage</span></p>

{% img /img/es/scoutstory/mangaclub/6_2.jpg %}

{% bubble Mao %}
<th>(Woah…. Hasumi-senpai wasn’t kidding, the audience is <em>huge</em>…)</th>

<th>(Are the others doing okay?)</th>

<th>(—Mm~ Takamine and Tori are as nervous as ever. They’re frozen in their seats.)</th>

<th>(To be fair, I’m pretty nervous too…! What now… Maybe I should talk to them first?)</th>

<th>(Mm? Hasumi-senpai is telling us something…?)</th>
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Keito %}
*<th>(whispering)</th>* We may have a large audience here, but it’s nothing compared to our audiences for our live shows. There’s no need to be so frightened.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mao %}
<th>(Ohh~! Hasumi-senpai’s amazing. He’s right, we’ve performed on stages with way bigger audiences. Yeah, that does give me some confidence that I can do this…!)</th>

<th>(Takamine and Tori seem calmer now, too — We should be able to compete against the other team just fine like this.)</th>

<th>(Alright, let’s get a point right from the first question!)</th>
{% endbubble %}

## Chapter 7

{% bubble Jun v3 %}
Umm, that’s… erm…

Ah! Pink pickled garlic and fried chicken!

—Hell yeah\~! I did it\~! I remembered it just on time!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mao %}
Nice one, Sazanami!

We totally got this! We’re managing the one-point per person plan just fine! We’re able to keep up with such strong competition…!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Keito %}
There’s a three-point difference between us and the other team… It’s good that we’re catching up, but we’re going to fall back at this rate.

We’re on the last stage of the quiz, too. The final question could be right before us, so we may not be able to close the gap in time.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mao %}
Uu… We made it so far, but it’s still tough to try and win through the one-point per question method…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tori %}
Wah!? Oh gosh, the last question really <em>did</em> end up happening~! What’re we gonna dooo!?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
Uuu, we’re done for… How’re we supposed to close the gap with a three-point difference… There’s nothing we can do anymore, right…? We did the best we could, right…?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Jun v3 %}
—Mm? Huh? The question is—
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mao %}
They asked for the title of the 21st volume of Pirates of Treasure, right?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Jun v3 %}
—! That’s…! Ah, crap, I need to write it *now!*

<th>(Gah, my hand is shaking. It’s so hard to write…! I’m so nervous— No, more like excited…!)</th>
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tori %}
<th>(I know what you mean! Isn’t that from our first quiz!? Who would’ve thought we’d get the same question!)</th>
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
<th>(Umm… Calm down, me, you know the answer. T-This is it, right…? Mhm, it should be fine…)</th>
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Keito %}
<th>(Heh… to think Buddha would smile upon us like this.)</th>

<th>(It is said that Buddha comes to help you <em>because</em> you worked so hard. I’m sure these kids’ hard work is what made this opportunity strike.)</th>
{% endbubble %}

{% img /img/es/scoutstory/mangaclub/maoorigcg.jpg %}

{% bubble Mao %}
Alright! I wrote it! We all wrote our answers, so I’m pressing the button…!

<th>(Ahaha, everyone’s looking so excited~ I get it, man! It’s a question we <em>all</em> know the answer to, after all!)</th>

{% bubble Tori %}
No, no, Takamine! It’s way too far to the right!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
Huh? Then… like this…?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tori %}
No~! Now it’s way too far to the *left!*
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
Ehh…? This is starting to be a pain…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tori %}
Gosh, you don’t get it! It’s gotta be centered or it won’t look as good! C’mon, go back to the right a little.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
Alright… Mm~… Like this?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tori %}
Mhm! Perfect! ♪ It’s right in the middle. Great job!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
*Sigh…* It’s finally over. It’s so depressing whenever I’m put in this position just ‘cause of my height…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Jun v3 %}
We prepared the other side, too. How’s it going over on yours?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mao %}
Ohh~! It looks perfect! Wow, that’s totally Sensei’s autograph! And we won it with our very own hands!

It really <em>does</em> have a different air to it when it’s in a pretty frame~ Hasumi-senpai, are you sure it’s okay for us to use one that’s so expensive-looking?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Keito %}
Yeah, it was bound to just lay stored in my family’s storage. It’ll find better use residing somewhere where people can see it.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Jun v3 %}
I still didn’t feel like we’d won when the quiz was over, but…

Now that we’re decorating the library with it, it’s really starting to sink in\~ We really did win, huh\~?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mao %}
Yeah, I feel ya! It all starts to hit you once time passes!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Jun v3 %}
Plus, we were all correct together, whereas the other team went for a solo point — so we ended up winning with a one-point difference! It felt exhilarating~
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tori %}
I was shaking when the last question was something we already covered. I wanted to yell, “Hey, it’s that question we practiced!”
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
Miracles really do happen, huh… But I seriously don’t think I can handle another nerve-wracking event like that ever again.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Keito %}
Oh? But you managed to answer just fine. I believe you’re quite suited for quizzes.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
Huh!? No, no, it’s fine! I already forgot everything, since we were just cramming so much in a short amount of time. Also I’d just feel depressed if I had to experience that nervousness over and over again…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mao %}
Umm, <em><th>(coughs)</th></em>… Well, I’m sure we all have a million things to say, but this isn’t the right place for it, so…

How about we move to the common room and talk all about it while eating snacks? Like a party to celebrate our victory…♪
