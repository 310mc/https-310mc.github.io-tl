Hey, hey, Yuuta-kun! Regarding our next job, what do you think about the plan that the Vice Prez proposed?

A radio program with you and me as the main MCs! Provisional title: “The Aoi Twin Talk” — doesn’t that sound super interesting?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Yuta %}
Hmmm, does it?

I don’t mind if that’s what you wanna do, Hinata-ku— Aniki. But haven’t you kinda been too on board with the Vice Prez’s ideas lately?

Thanks to that, we’ve been accepting work willy nilly, and we ended up doing an intense whirlwind of a tour, too — that was a real shock…

I also wanna make sure our steps synchronize, you know? But I’d prefer it if we accepted work more systematically~?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Hinata %}
Mmm, but the Vice Prez went through all the trouble of giving us this job; we're newcomers to CosPro, so we should really appreciate that.

Remember how the Vice Prez said, “At Yumenosaki Academy, you got a lot of work where you were just the opening act, so I’ll give you lots of different kinds of jobs from now on,” and stuff?

If we improve our portfolio, 2wink’s worth is gonna rise… You agreed with that, didnt’ cha, Yuuta-kun?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Yuta %}
I *did*, but… You accept jobs without thinking them through enough way too often, Aniki.

You say this is for our sake and stuff, but you want us to work as *radio MCs*. How many people can even distinguish us from our voices?

People already have trouble telling us apart based on how we look, so the results will probably be even more disastrous when it comes to how we sound~?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Hinata %}
What you’re saying is reasonable, Yuuta-kun. But I think there’s value in trying *because* no one will be able to do it ♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Yuta %}
No, no, don’t you think radio work is seriously out of the question?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Hinata %}
I’m telling you, it’s *in* the question! Geez, you’ve been going through your rebellious phase lately, huh~?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Yuta %}
You’re just too docile, aren’t you, Aniki~? Put yourself in my shoes — I’ve gotta keep up with you, you know?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Nagisa %}
…You two from 2wink.

…You appear to be rather unsettled. Did something happen?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Hinata %}
Ah, Ran-senpai. Sorry for being all noisy in the office. We’re just having our normal meeting, so don’t worry about it, ‘kay? Salute~☆
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Yuta %}
We’re just having something of a brotherly quarrel, so there’s nothing to worry about! Salute~☆
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Nagisa %}
…Is that so. Then it’s fine, but. Are you imitating Ibara?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Yuta %}
Ahaha. We’re not really imitating him. We kinda just picked up his habit, maybe ‘cause he’s been greeting us pretty often lately. If I had to give it a name, it would be… yeah! The CosPro Hello!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Hinata %}
We don’t really feel super at home here in CosPro, so we at least wanna have this little ritual ♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Nagisa %}
…Mirroring. A psychological technique, I believe.

…By imitating someone’s mannerisms, one is able to easily foster a feeling of amity within them. Could it be that you two are trying to get along better with Ibara by mirroring him?

…In any case, I believe that developing a relationship is a good thing to do.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Hinata %}
A-Ahaha… We’ve never really thought about it that deeply?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Yuta %}
Aniki, it’s leaking into your expression, it’s leaking.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Hinata %}
It’s not, it’s not! See, I look just the same as I always do, right?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Yuta %}
Wah, it’s a face that looks just like mine! You really are my Aniki!

…Okay, that’s enough twin jokes.

By the way, Ran-senpai, are you not with the other members of Eden today?

I feel like you do things together pretty often. You didn’t *actually* have a falling out during Conquest, right?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Nagisa %}
…Fufu. Of course not.

…I simply have plans to meet Anzu-san here.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Hinata %}
Anzu-san? That’s rare~ Eden’s essentially getting produced by the Vice Prez, so it feels like you two don’t really interact that much.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Yuta %}
And the Producer’s Association was established, so it’s even harder to request stuff from her now.

But this *is* Anzu-san we’re talking about; she would probably accept anything we ask of her anyway.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Nagisa %}
…Yeah. I feel quite bad for doing this to her when she’s so busy, but this is something I wanted to request of her no matter what.

…Those who are spoken of do appear — it seems that she has arrived.

…On that note, see you later. Hinata-kun, Yuuta-kun.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Hinata %}
He left so gallantly. Even when he’s just walking, Ran-senpai kinda has this amazing aura to him.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Yuta %}
As expected of the Vice Prez’s treasure. But I wonder what he meant when he was talking about something he could only request of Anzu-san?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Hinata %}
Mmm, yeah. Normally he leaves pretty much everything to the Vice Prez, so if it’s something that he could only request of Anzu-san, then —

Ah, don’t tell me he really did have a falling out during Conquest, so now he’s trying to leave CosPro? If he’s transferring agencies, there’s no way he could ask the Vice Prez!

Could he be going to check out the other agencies with Anzu-san…?!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Yuta %}
You’re probably overthinking this. Like, the ones who fought at Conquest were Adam and Eve.

If *anyone’s* moving, wouldn’t it make more sense that Eve does?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Hinata %}
Alllright, I’ve understood what you’re trying to say, Yuuta-kun. Let’s bet on who’s gonna move, then!

The one who loses has to imitate the winner and work as them for a week!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Yuta %}
No, no, no gambling! We’d *both* lose out if we did that sort of punishment game, anyway!

Hmm, it’s not good to stick your neck into other people’s business, but if this really is a serious problem, we’d be in a dangerous position. Ran-senpai’s pretty much the face of CosPro, after all.

I’m his roommate, so I can try subtly asking him stuff later?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Hinata %}
Yup, yup, I agree! Since this is an important matter that’s related to our contract!

If this turns out to be the worst case scenario, we’ve gotta seize our chance, okay~? Our strength is having that kinda nimbleness, after all ♪

{% bubble Nagisa %}
…We’ve arrived, Anzu-san.

…Taking the train here was a very novel experience. I normally just use a CosPro courtesy car.

…Fufu, my disguise also worked well. It was quite interesting; I felt as if I was on a secret infiltration mission ♪

…“Do you feel nostalgic, coming back to Yumenosaki,” you ask?

…Yes. When I’m back here, I feel like I can remember everything as if it were yesterday.

…I do not know whether you are aware of this or not, but in the past, this place was a battlefield.

…We, as members of *fine*, reformed the corrupted Yumenosaki Academy.

…The four of us — Hiyori-kun, myself and Tsumugi-kun, with Eichi-kun acting as our leader from the shadows — realized a great cause.

…Many people were victimized by our actions, but Yumenosaki Academy was able to regain its legitimacy as an idol training school.

…However, just before our objective was achieved, we left *fine*. Our contract was fulfilled — just like that, we ran away from facing the onus of our war crimes.

…In every age, it is the winners who write history. Even if we were to have remained in *fine*, we most likely would have been able to maintain our position and continue controlling history.

…At least, Eichi-kun would have been able to. But we didn’t.

…In the end, Hiyori-kun and I transferred schools.

…Regrets? No, I don’t have any.

…I left and was subsequently able to become happy.

…However. Perhaps I was guided back here once more precisely because I feel that way.

…Back to this school I once attended — to Yumenosaki Academy.

Hey hey, gimme the ball! Sally~, I wanna play more ☆
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mao %}
Alright, alright, I’m passing~☆
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Subaru %}
Oooh, atta boy Sally~! There’s not a single pass you can’t do, Archmage of the Court!

…Hold up, you didn’t pass to me?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
Y-You’re passing it to me…? Ummm…

I might be able to make the shot from here… Here goes…☆
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mao %}
Oooh, so close. Almost tipped in, huh~?

Nice try, Takamine ♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Subaru %}
Heeey, Sally~! *I* could’ve made it if you passed it to me! C’mon, I’m right here, pick me more!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
Uuu, sorry I missed it…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mao %}
There’s nothing to apologize for, Takamine. Subaru’s just a ball hog.

Anyway, it’s hard to pass if you *ask* for it, you know~? In a real game, you’d be boxed out.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Subaru %}
Heheh! Wouldn’t stop me, I’d just slip through their defense like the star player I am! I wanna shine even more during basketball…☆

Put me in, Coach!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mao %}
Come on~, you know basketball’s pretty much a team sport, right? Try and understand that every now and then.

Well, it’s not like we’re aiming to go to Nationals or anything like that, so I *guess* it’s fine for you to just play around.

But we won’t win any games if we leave it all on your hands, Subaru. Though, we *did* have Morisawa-senpai with us last year, so our positions *were* split just perfectly back then…

This year, I’m gonna have to make Takamine come out of his shell and get more aggressive with his plays so he can become a regular. I’ve got great hopes in him thanks to his height.

There’s only so much a one man team can do. Even *you* know that, don’t you, Subaru?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Subaru %}
Yeah, it’s bow wowzers!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mao %}
It’s one *man* team, not a one *dog* team! …Yeah, why did I even try to reply to that.

{% bubble Midori %}
Isara-senpai, sorry for saying this right after you said you had hopes in me, but… this practice game’s tired me out — Could I take a rest…?

I much prefer doing small tasks and stuff, so I’d rather watch you guys play…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mao %}
Hm… Maybe I put too much on your shoulders, then. For now, since you’re exhausted from playing, why don’t we take a little break?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Subaru %}
Okay~. Alright everyone, attention please! You heard what the captain said, take a ten! ☆

Ahaha. It feels kinda weird to manage the club since we don’t really get the chance to come often, but I’m real glad that everyone listens anyway~♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mao %}
For real~. But as it stands, we really *can’t* show up much.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
Something about how you guys used up a ton of money in BIGBANG, and now have to work hard to compensate for it…?[^2]
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Subaru %}
Ahaha, yeah, you could say we’re really drowning in debt. And Sally~’s got Student Council work pouring in too, y’see?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mao %}
Yeah. Thankfully we had a day off to show up today, but in the meanwhile I’ve been leaving it up to the other basketball club members for the most part. I've gotta do something about that.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Subaru %}
There’s not enough time in a day, huh? Sally~, can’t you just use magic to put more hours in the day?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mao %}
You’re definitely putting too much faith into magic, there. Even fiction doesn’t go that far with it, you know?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
Um, Isara-senpai. Your phone’s been ringing for a while now, y’know…?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mao %}
Oh? I was so busy talking, I didn’t even notice. Thanks~♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mao %}
I wonder who it is… Is it about a job?

Oh, it’s Anzu. What’s up?

Mm? Where am I right now? Today’s my day off, so I’m in the Gym with the club.

You’re heading here now, so I can keep playing?

Ahh, gotcha. Then I’ll keep practicing with the team in the meantime. See ya soon~♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Subaru %}
What, what? Did Anzu call about work?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mao %}
Well~… It seems like we’ve got someone interested in the Basketball Club, according to Anzu.

I wonder who it is~. Maybe she found a promising first year or something?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
Whaa~? We’re getting a new member…? Ugh, please no… I’m too awkward and shy with people to handle *another* member…

What kinda guy is he gonna be…? I really hope he’s not scary…

{% bubble Nagisa %}
…………
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
Huh…?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mao %}
Huh?

Uhh, I’m not seeing wrong, am I? What’s Nagisa-san doing here?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Subaru %}
Look, Anzu’s here too! So Nagisa-san’s the one who wanted to see us in action!

Heeey, Nagisa-san! Welcome to Yumenosaki Academy~☆
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Nagisa %}
…Ah, Subaru-kun. Pardon my interruption.

…It’s been a while since I’ve visited my alma mater, but it hasn’t changed at all. Although it appears to be a bit more orderly.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Subaru %}
That’s riiight, you’re an alumni of Yumenosaki… In that case, I should be saying “Welcome back” instead, right?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Nagisa %}
…Yeah. Either is fine — thank you for the welcome.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mao %}
When I heard someone was coming to see the club with Anzu, I never would’ve thought it’d be Nagisa-san. What’d you come here for?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Subaru %}
That oughta be obvious, right~? Nagisa-san wants to play basketball!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mao %}
There’s no way that’s right. It’s gotta be for a different reason, right?

Look, think realistically. Nagisa-san came back with Anzu to the school he once attended. Don’t you think there’s definitely something else to that?

Nagisa-san doesn’t seem like the kinda person who’d be interested in club activities and stuff like that. He might just wanna try dabbling in basketball a little ‘cause he got a job related to it — something like that.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Nagisa %}
…No. I simply wanted to play basketball.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mao %}
Seriously?!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Subaru %}
Told you so~♪ Aaand to the person who got that answer right, ten points!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
Since when was this a quiz show…?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Subaru %}
Nice one, Takamin!

But like, it *is* weird that Nagisa-san wants to play basketball.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mao %}
Why basketball, though? I thought you weren’t interested in anything except idols…

You called me a flashlight that mistook himself for a star back then too. ♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Nagisa %}
…Are you perhaps still holding a grudge because of what I said to you in the past?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mao %}
Ahaha ♪ I’m just joking, don’t worry about it. ♪

I just wanted to see if I could check how you feel about that perspective. I mean, I dunno, it really is strange to see that you wanna play basketball, y’know?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Nagisa %}
…I am not good at reading the subtleties in what people say.

…As you all know, I do not wish to be involved with this secular world.

…However, there is meaning to my visit. I would be happy if you could accept that without asking about my circumstances.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mao %}
Hmm… Then it’s a matter of probable liability in case you’re injured on court, and I definitely don’t have a waiver on hand that you can sign…

But since you came to Yumenosaki expressly, there’s no way I could send you away empty handed either…

It might be a good experience for the basketball team to go against a Top Idol, anyway. That alright with all of you?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Subaru %}
I wholeheartedly welcome the challenge! Let’s get right to it after he does his pre-stretches, like pronto!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Nagisa %}
…I’ve already made my preparations, so we may begin. What should we do first?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Subaru %}
Let’s do 1v1! Me against you, Nagisa-san! ☆
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mao %}
Hey now, don’t just start without us like that\~. I get that you wanna play with him, but c’mon\~.

*Sigh*, seems like those guys seriously can’t wait a sec. I’d better get everyone ready fast.

Alright, gather ‘round! I’ve got something I wanna say!

Ran Nagisa-san came here today to experience a bit of basketball for his own personal reasons! Seems like he’s a first-timer, so let’s go easy on him!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Subaru %}
No problem~☆ Lemme be the one to take gooood care of Nagisa-san!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mao %}
Alright, alright. I’ll leave him to you.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Subaru %}
Hurray! Lookin’ forward to teaching you, Nagisa-san!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Nagisa %}
…Thank you. Best regards, Subaru-kun.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Subaru %}
Alrighty, let’s get started right away! First off, let’s take this ball from the center court and get closer to shoot it.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Nagisa %}
…Like this?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Subaru %}
Stop, stop! You can’t just walk it over there, okay? That’s traveling!

If you hold the ball for more than three steps you’ll get a penalty, so you gotta dribble it!

I’ll show you what I mean, so watch and learn. You take the ball and bounce it against the court, and it’s gotta hit your hand for it to count as a “dribble”. You keep that up as you move!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Nagisa %}
…Could you show me what to do next?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Subaru %}
Let’s see, what else…

Once you’ve dribbled, you can pass to a teammate or take a shot at the goal up there.

Sally~, Takamin! I wanna show Nagisa-san what I mean, so do you mind giving me a hand?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mao %}
Sure! It’s a little sudden, but I'm always ready to go.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
I-I gotta help, too…?

Don’t wanna… I’m bad at making plays.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Subaru %}
Everything’s just another experience! ♪

But y’know, Takamin, if you’re gonna be a big baby about it, then I’m just gonna hafta coach you veeery closely~.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
Ughhh… You’re so overbearing, it’s reminding me of Morisawa-senpai…

Fine… I don’t want Akehoshi-senpai anywhere near me, so I’ll do what I gotta do.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Subaru %}
Alright, that’s the spirit! Let’s go offense right off the bat! Is everyone good to go?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mao %}
You bet!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
G-Go ahead…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Subaru %}
Alright, and… Start! Sally~!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mao %}
Nice pass, Subaru!

Then I’ll return it back to him… Psyche! Takamine, heads up!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
U-Umm… Then I slip through the defense and— Akehoshi-senpai!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Subaru %}
Totally awesome~! And without missin’ a beat, dunk it…☆
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mao %}
Nice one, Subaru!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
What a clean goal.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Subaru %}
So how about it, Nagisa-san? This is the kinda sport basketball is. ☆
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Nagisa %}
…Yeah. I believe I’ve more or less grasped it.

…Well, then. I’ll try it immediately. Is this a dribble?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Subaru %}
Huh? That move just now… What? He’s already overtaken me?!
{% endbubble %}

{% img https://f005.backblazeb2.com/file/reitoouji/ro_2z67673c08XU2s62.webp?timestamp=1734818833680 %}

…I’ll pull a feint. And, like that, I’ll slam dunk ♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Subaru %}
Whoa, that’s amazin’! Looks like the fruits of my labor showed themselves right away…☆
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
H-Hold on a second, Akehoshi-senpai! Don’t you think something’s clearly off here!?

T-There’s *no* way that a real amateur would play like that…!?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mao %}
Ahaha… Maybe Nagisa-san’s got a knack for basketball?

Nah, can’t be. If that were true, it’d really knock me down~.

Alright, we’ll end shooting practice around here. Let’s take a short break.

<th>(…Phew. It’s been so long since I actually acted as Captain, I almost forgot what to do. There’s way too many things I gotta do as one… but looks I’ll be making it through somehow.)</th>

<th>(Now, let’s see. What’s goin’ on at the other side of the court?)</th>

<th>(Nagisa-san picked up things extremely quickly, so Subaru and Takamine are playing against him 2 on 1 right now.)</th>
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Nagisa %}
…Here I go.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Subaru %}
Takamin, Nagisa-san’s going on the offensive! Don’t let him slip through!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
*Hah, huff*… I-I can’t go on anymore…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Subaru %}
Oooh, that all you got? Then we’ve got no choice, let’s put a stop to him together by combining!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
Combining…?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Subaru %}
Yeah! Lemme up on your shoulders, big guy! Then we’ll become an impenetrable iron wall…☆
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Nagisa %}
…Shoot.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Subaru %}
Whoa?! It went in!

Ugh, Takamiiin, you’ve gotta actually *block* his shot and then pass it to me!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
Uhh, I’m pretty sure it’s *you* who has to block it, though…?

I’ve been a benchwarmer for years — why would you try and get me to do the blocking…?

If you’re just gonna start ragging on me, then why don’t you direct that frustration on the game itself or something, please…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Subaru %}
So how about we beat Nagisa-san and get some confidence in you instead~! ‘Cause idols like us grow best through battle, y’know? ♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mao %}
*Hey*, you’re asking for the impossible from him, Subaru.

Seriously, the moment I take my eyes off you, you’re doing some weird combo thing~. Just *who* do you think’d have to deal with the fallout if someone gets injured?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Subaru %}
Mm~, it’ll be fine! We’re not slamming into each other, and we aren’t getting as heated up as we usually do during a real match, you know?

Don’tcha think so, Nagisa-sa—…Mm? What’re you squatting for?

Did you hurt yourself somehow? Are you okay? Can you stand?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Nagisa %}
…Subaru-kun. What exactly is this line?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Subaru %}
Line…?

Ooh, that’s the three-point line! If you score from there or outside it, then you’ll get a lotta points!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Nagisa %}
…So I should shoot from here, I suppose.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Subaru %}
Whoa, it went in! Awesomesauce~♪

You’ve gotten seriously good in just a day! Why not start playing basketball seriously from here on?

You could totally go pro if you keep it up like this! We could go to the *Nationals* together!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Nagisa %}
…No. I am an idol.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Subaru %}
Ahaha, I was just joking! Things would go crazy around here if we just snatched you off the path of being an idol, right? I think it’s the same way for me, probably.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Nagisa %}
…Fufu. You *are* that person’s son, after all.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mao %}
Mmm~, I wasn’t really sure how this’d turn out, but I guess I was worried about nothing at all, huh?

By the way, you said you visited the Basketball Club because you had some business to take care of, right? Did you get what you came for?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Nagisa %}
…Yeah. More or less.

…I wanted to learn about Yumenosaki Academy’s current condition. That mission of mine has been completed. Thank you.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
Current condition…? Oh yeah, you used to be in this school, right?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Subaru %}
Ooooh, I get it. It’s that “alumni comes back to check on their old school” kinda feel, huh.

That’s why you asked Anzu, who’s going here right now, to bring you over.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mao %}
Huh, so that’s why… And then she contacted me, since I’m the Student Council President.

If I remember right, Nagisa-san was a member of *fine* in the past.

So I guess now that he’s gotten over that time, he got curious about Yumenosaki Academy’s state of affairs.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Subaru %}
Huh? What’s up, Anzu? That’s not all?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Nagisa %}
…Yeah. That’s correct. There is one more thing I must do.

…I left behind a lost article in the Record Room.

…That is why I would like the current Student Council President’s permission to enter it.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Subaru %}
Oh, okay. Then I’m goin’ too! Since it’s rare for you to visit, Nagisa-san, I oughta show you some proper *hospitality*!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mao %}
Hold on, don’t just go off on your own without permission, Subaru!

*Sigh*. Well, it’s not like we’ve got anything to hide anyway, so go ahead.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Subaru %}
Ohhh yeah, Sally~, you always get the gist of it! ♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mao %}
You’re way too over the moon… Yeesh, you can’t treat Student Council stuff the same way you treat Trickstar stuff.

Mm~… Still, if you really wanna do it that much, I guess I’ll let you be the one to escort him.

It’d be bad if something happened while someone from CosPro was in the school, after all, and I’ve still gotta manage the Basketball Club.

You two’re both geniuses in your own rights, so you’ll probably have an easy time talking to each other. I’ll leave it in your hands, Subaru.
{% endbubble %}

Sweet~☆ Consider it done! Let’s go, Anzu, Nagisa-san!

So what’re you looking for anyway, Nagisa-san? You’re always reading, so is it a book you treasure or something~?

Or maybe it’s something to do with idols… An old outfit of *fine*’s maybe?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Nagisa %}
…There is no need to rush. You’ll soon understand.

…To me, it is something of a memento.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Subaru %}

{% bubble Subaru %}
Here’s the Record Room, Nagisa-san!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Nagisa %}
…Subaru-kun. And Anzu-san. Thank you for leading me here.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Subaru %}
No problemo! I don’t really use this room that much myself, but it’s got a ton of idol-related things in it.

So what’re you looking for anyway, Nagisa-san? Gonna tell us anytime soon?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Nagisa %}
…Before I tell you that, allow me to ask you a question. Are you the type to reflect on the past?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Subaru %}
What’s with this all of a sudden, some kinda psych test?

We~ll, I don’t really like to think about the past or the future, I guess.

What I mean is that they’re not the “now”. Living each day to the fullest is the best ☆
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Nagisa %}
…Then, is it fine to disregard your past?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Subaru %}
Huh~? What the hell, Nagisa-san, are you tryin’ to trick me into saying something?

Of *course* the past’s important. Everything that happened back then is what makes me *me* now.

But if I keep looking back at the past too much, then I won’t be able to make the most of the days I have right now. I won’t be able to grasp the future I want – that’s what I think, anyway.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Nagisa %}
…That’s right. It is just as you say.

…History repeats itself. That is why we humans record events in books.

…Of course, such history is merely what the winners have decided it to be.

…A great number of victims were created as the result of our revolution.

…That is most likely why Hiyori-kun did not wish to come to Yumenosaki Academy with me.

…He is kind, so he feels responsibility for his past actions.

…He could have believed that he was taught fake doctrines, that he was deceived — he could have made such excuses, but he didn’t.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Subaru %}
Mm? What do you mean?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Nagisa %}
…Fufu. You are just like me; you are an optimist.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Subaru %}
Whoa, Nagisa-san? Why’re you petting my head all of a sudden~?

Did I say something praiseworthy or what?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Nagisa %}
…The truth is, the reason I came here is also because of what happened in the past.

…Having undergone Conquest recently, Adam and Eve experienced internal discord.

…That was the scenario we were given, and we executed a performance that could even be called an instantaneous disbanding.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Subaru %}
Ohh yeah, the bigwigs at CosPro just played it up like that or something, right?

Then it was a fixed match from the start, huh? Like how wrestling is.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Nagisa %}
…Both of the things you said are correct. We actually did conduct ourselves so as to convince the audience that it was such a show.

…In any case. There were repercussions for Conquest, and it was decided that the members of Eden will produce a feature television program.

…We will describe the sequence of events that led to the formation of our unit to a certain extent, as well.

…Of course, discussion of my father and the revolution that occurred in Yumenosaki will be omitted, even though the program is meant to be acted out as the telling of a youthful story.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Subaru %}
So *that’s* why you wanted to come to the Record Room.

If you’re gonna talk about how Eden got together, then there’s no way you *can’t* talk about the old *fine* – you and Ohii~san used to be part of it, after all.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Nagisa %}
…Yeah. It looked like Hiyori-kun didn’t want to remember such things, so I came to retrieve things in his place.

…Because the activity records of the old *fine* should still be here.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Subaru %}
A memento, huh. Is it really gonna be that easy to find, though…? If it’s about *that*, then I feel like Eichi-senpai or someone might've hidden it somewhere ‘cause it’d be bad if anyone found it.

Anzu’s looked through two years worth of documents too, and she hasn’t found anything either.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Nagisa %}
…If you want to hide a tree, you should hide it in a forest. This is Eichi-kun we are speaking of; he would most likely venture to leave them in the Record Room.

…Documents are gathered here semi-automatically. It should be a logical choice to leave them in such a place.

…Worrying about a special hiding spot would become a burden. Considering him, he’d surely have thought something along those lines.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Subaru %}
Yeah, the revolution that old *fine* began was, like, necessary in Eichi-senpai’s eyes, after all. I guess he wouldn't wanna act like it was something that never happened then, right?

I wonder if it’s tucked away in some corner of this Record Room. Maybe it’s in one of these old cardboard boxes?

Mm~. There’s a lotta stuff in here. Nagisa-san, Anzu, mind givin' me a hand?

Since we don’t get to do this often, how about we have a little fun? The first person to find what we’re lookin’ for gets a soda~. That sorta thing!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Nagisa %}
…Yes, you’re right. By giving someone recompense for their accomplishments, their ambition will further rise. I believe this is a psychological approach that shows a good understanding of animals’ reward systems.

…We humans have spun the tale of history by finding purpose in our deeds and regulating our actions.

…The actions we execute in our lives are surely affirmed by such emotions that are present within each and every one of us.

…Even though, considering the scale of history, we may merely be tiny, brief, single-volumed stories.
{% endbubble %}

## Remains of a Dream 6

<div class="msr-narration">
    <p>A few minutes later…</p>
</div>

{% bubble Subaru %}
Hmm~. Doesn’t seem like we’ll be striking gold anytime soon in these documents either. Maybe it’s ‘cause everyone worked suuuper hard last year, but there sure are a lot of DreamFes proposals here, huh?

Whoa, take a look at this…

How nostalgic ♪ Isn’t this the S2 we planned together, Anzu?

We started training for the SS right before we could do a DreamFes in the school though, so in the end the proposal fell through.

We talked about if we could maybe do something in autumn instead, right?

Speaking of, we did a live with Adam around that time last year, didn’t we? The Autumn Live, right?[^3]

But since our battle at the SS, we haven’t really had much to do with each other, huh?

I wanna have another live sometime with you, Nagisa-san! I had looooots of fun back then ♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Nagisa %}
…Yeah. I want to, as well.

…After all, I'm connected to you, Subaru-kun. And the scandal involving your father occurred during SS, so that wasn’t a good time to do so.

…I have a feeling the continuation is being postponed.

…Your father often taught me, too.

…Just like how you taught me basketball today.

…As well as the reason why idols exist.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Subaru %}
Talk about a blast from the past~. That’s something I learned during the finals of the SS– Man, it’s been *half a year* since then.

Fufu. I think you mentioned before that Dad’s performances live on within you.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Nagisa %}
…I wonder. I am not your father’s successor.

…However, he was an idol who built up an age.

…I believe he lives on within not only me, but so many other idols.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Subaru %}
Ahaha. If that’s true, then I’m happy…♪

But I still can't really, *fully* believe this is happening.

Like, how am I actually getting to talk about Dad like this when he just… *vanished*?

Ah, uh– S-Sorry, I think I’ve got something in my eye!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Nagisa %}
…Are you alright?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Subaru %}
Peachy keen, don’t worry! I just got unbearably happy, that’s all!

I never thought I’d get that excited talking about my Dad though, like, I dunno…?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Nagisa %}
…Subaru-kun, relax.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Subaru %}
Eh?! Um?! Why’re you huggin’ me?!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Nagisa %}
…Because I thought your father would do the same.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Subaru %}
Y-Yeah, I’m sure, but this is more embarrassing than a normal hug!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Nagisa %}
…Sorry. It appears that I have failed to keep an appropriate distance.

…However, I also empathize with you.

…He disappeared so abruptly. Under normal circumstances, your father would have continued to be broadcasted on television or on the radio, but he received disparagement for crimes he didn’t commit and was erased instead.

…The light of a star that had brightened its surroundings vanished and was lost so suddenly.

…My father also tried not to leave any traces of himself on the front stage as he lived. He was in charge of the darkness of the entertainment industry, so there are barely any remaining records of him.

…I initially thought that you and I were the exact opposites of each other. However, as people with similar circumstances and who have chosen similar paths, we are able to understand one another.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Subaru %}
That’s really something else, huh?

I dunno, like, talking about my dad is always such a gloomy and dark topic, so I’d always try avoiding it.

I tried telling myself not to cling to the past, and yet…

For some reason, I felt like it’d be fine to talk to you about it, Nagisa-san.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Nagisa %}
…That’s right.

…Humans are creatures that are incapable of completely understanding each other. That is precisely why I believe being able to walk side by side and empathize with one another is a miracle.

…Come here, O twin soul of mine.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Subaru %}
Ahaha. It’s way too embarrassing to be called that, you knooow?

Thanks, Nagisa-san.

…Huh? What’s up, Anzu?

You found the documents about the old *fine* that we were looking for? Ahh, so it was in the very back of the boxes… What was it doing lying back there?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Nagisa %}
…Thank you. It truly was the right decision to ask this of you, Anzu-san.

…You were even so kind as to search while we were talking, I see.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Subaru %}
Sorry, Anzu. We just got too into it, I guess?

So, so? What’s the memento?

Oooh, it’s a picture of the four of you from the old *fine* smiling together. When did you guys do this?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Nagisa %}
…Fufu. When we first banded together, Tsumugi-kun said we should take a photo to commemorate.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Subaru %}
Ahaha, of course it was Blue-senpai who did!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Nagisa %}
…Yeah. That is one of his strengths.

…He knew the importance of whittling down and preserving the moments of the past.

…Remaining stagnant in the past may not be desirable.

…But going into mourning and learning from what has happened are necessary functions.

…Humans are not such rational creatures that we are able to discard those abilities and still continue progressing.

…By coming to terms with your past, you are finally able to walk forward.

…Yeah, it’s a good picture ♪

Man, it’s been *way* too long since I got to have fun with the club~! Every part of my body hurts. ♪

I’m really glad I got to play basketball with you, as well. Don’t ya feel the same, Takamine? ♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
I’m so depressed…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mao %}
…Takamine?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
Urghh, I never once expected the club to be so exhausting with you around, of all people…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mao %}
I couldn’t help it, y’know~. The juniors kept saying they wanna work hard and push their limits, so the right thing to do would be to keep up with them. ♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
You *really* didn’t have to follow Morisawa-senpai’s footsteps when it comes to that…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mao %}
Wha\~? I’m gonna tell him to come over if you keep saying stuff like that, y’know\~?

He’s been real busy with work lately, but I bet Morisawa-senpai wants to come back and visit Yumenosaki sometime. Subaru and I can’t come by as often as we’d like, so maybe I’ll ask him to come and see the club. ♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
Eep— No, that’s the worst idea ever…! That guy's graduated already, but he *still* torments me…

I had a nightmare about him just the other day, y’know…!? I even sweated through my blanket in my sleep… I really don’t want him to show up anywhere outside of work…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mao %}
I’m just joking. Well, I really haven’t been able to visit the club that often, but at least play basketball with us sometime, will ya?

You’re soooo slow. How long’re you gonna make me wait?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mao %}
Oh, hey. Were you waiting for us, Subaru?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Subaru %}
Sorta. It’s pretty rare that we get to go to the club together, so it’d be pretty lonely if we just went our own ways home, don’tcha think?

Also, Anzu and Nagisa-san said they wanted to go home with us too.

Right, Nagisa-san?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Nagisa %}
…………
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
Ran-senpai seems to be asleep…?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Nagisa %}
…I’m awake.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Subaru %}
Are you really, though~? Aren’t you tired enough to doze off?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Nagisa %}
…I was simply nodding off a little.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Subaru %}
Mmm? How’s that any different from what I said?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Nagisa %}
…What an interesting view.

…The dreams that we idols see when awake may be no different to the dreams we see when we are asleep. Essentially, they are the same.

…Idols can also be defined as ideals — the perfect embodiment of a concept — after all.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Subaru %}
That’s right! We’re in the middle of living our dreams! We’re dreaming whether awake or asleep…☆

But for some reason, you kinda have a soft air about you right now, Nagisa-san.

Before, you always seemed to be thinking too hard about what original sin was and stuff like that, like you were feeling suffocated by something.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Nagisa %}
…Is that so?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Subaru %}
Ah–. Is it because you had a good dream or something? It’s got you suuuper pumped, hasn’t it~?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mao %}
Mm~, I don’t think that Nagisa-san of all people would have that kinda post-dream energy, though.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
Maybe he got infected by Akehoshi-senpai or Isara-senpai’s overbearing attitude during our club practice…

Ughhh… I seriously can't stand that kinda infectious enthusiasm…

I wanna be a senior like Ran-senpai, ‘cause he isn’t overbearing…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mao %}
Ahaha, you’re being really cheeky for a junior\~! In that case, I'll just be extra obnoxious and show you exactly what you *shouldn't* do, you li'l brat\~♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
No thank you! I’ll resign if you do…!!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Subaru %}
Then I’ll just sign you right back up! You can’t escape the Basketball Club, Takamin…♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
Whaa… Please don’t do that without considering how I feel…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Nagisa %}
…Fufu. Things are very lively when I’m with you all; I never get bored.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mao %}
Ahaha, it’s always like this. ♪ Subaru’s keyed up on the regular, and Hokuto always tells him off for it…♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Subaru %}
Yup yup! It’s like there’s a festival every day!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Nagisa %}
…I see.

…I’m glad. You are all able to smile cheerfully now.

…I had thought that the flowers that bloomed on the battlefield would all wither.

…But new flowers appeared once more from the depths of the Earth.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
Ummm…? What do you mean?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Nagisa %}
…It means that my past was saved by the actions and smiles of Trickstar, I think.

…The battle that we waged, which wounded so many, wasn’t in vain.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
Battle…? You’re not talking about the revolution Trickstar did last year, right…?[^4]
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Nagisa %}
…That’s right, to you, the revolution was simply Trickstar itself.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
……?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mao %}
Ahh, just some old stuff. Nothing you need to know about~♪

There are now idols who can smile brightly, without worrying about anything or having anyone get in their way. And that’s proof that the battle for that cause has come to an end.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Subaru %}
That’s right! It’d just worry you if you learned what happened back then, Takamin, so that’s about all you need to know about it, okay~?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
Whaaa… But now I feel like I’m being left out, and I don’t like that…

And Morisawa-senpai’s always been pretty secretive about the stuff that’s actually important… Is it because I’m not trustworthy…?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mao %}
Mmm~, I doubt anyone really likes talking about the past, that’s all…

But, well, this is as good a chance as any. If you really wanna hear it, Takamine, then why don’t we tell you on the way back?

I only know bits of it myself, but Nagisa-san here’s a living piece of history. ♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Nagisa %}
…I wonder if that is true. I am only able to narrate history from my personal perspective, if that is alright with you.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Subaru %}
Then it’s decided! Let’s head to a family restaurant right now!

That means you too, Nagisa-san, ‘cause I wanna keep on talking to you. And people in different units don’t usually get the chance to get to know each other, right?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Nagisa %}
…Thank you.

…By virtue of you all existing, my dream self will surely be able to realise that everything wasn’t in vain.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Subaru %}
Huh? I knew it, you *did* dream of something!

Well well? What was it? Tell me~?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Nagisa %}
…You see, that is…

…Fufufu. A secret. ♪

{% bubble Eichi %}
…………
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Nagisa %}
…Eichi-kun?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Eichi %}
…Cough, cough.

I’m truly in dire straits. My physical condition has been poor ever since the live we had the other day.

I wonder if they’re no longer in Yumenosaki Academy… This may be our final parting, so I had it on my mind — what a shame.

No, this may be for the best. I used them as mercenaries. For the sake of the revolution, I invested my funds in them and made them fight.

For the sake of my ideals, I turned Yumenosaki Academy into a blood-stained battlefield — a place with an indelibly dark history. There will surely be repercussions for that.

A battlefield… No, perhaps it would be more appropriate to say that I turned it into a wasteland.

The plump, domesticated animals — the idols of Yumenosaki — needed to lose weight. And yet, they were still coddled.

The educational institute of spoilt idols who had lost their market value was in such a wretched state that I couldn’t even bear to look at it.

— That’s why I made them recover their ferality, the instincts they once had.

Natural selection must occur in order for life to progress. I don’t believe that is inherently bad.

I couldn’t get them to empathize with me, though.

Even so, I’d be so happy if a miracle occurred and we could walk together once more — if they could understand that my ideals also had righteousness to them.

And yet the person most aware of the fact that such a dream is nothing more than a futile wish is none other than me, myself.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Eichi %}
…Goodbye. Hiyori-kun, Nagisa-kun.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Nagisa %}
…It’s the Eichi-kun of the past. Is he an inhabitant of my dreams, as well?

…At that time, Eichi-kun was exhausted.

…He was so overwhelmed, he shouldn’t have been able to even spare us a thought.

…Perhaps this scenery before me is the dream I wanted to see.

…I understand now. This place, this scene is —

…The events that took place a few days after I left *fine*.

…I was in despair about everything and had just submitted the documents necessary to take a leave of absence from Yumenosaki Academy. It was the day of parting.

…At that time, I recall sitting in front of the fountain.

…I’ll go. To see the me of the past.

…I also. Killed them with my own two hands. The innocent. Pure. Idols.

…You are now able to regain happiness. You, who had lost everything back then.
