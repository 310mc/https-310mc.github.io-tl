Wonderful work, everyone~♪ Whew, the first half of our recording is finally over.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tomoya norsmile2 %}
Yeah, and we’re getting through it quicker than scheduled, so it looks like we have a lot more time to rest.

Let’s relax during our break, and do our best in the second half.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mitsuru blushjoy %}
Woohoo~! There’s soooo many sweets I’ve never seen before! ☆ They all look super duper tasty!

I dunno which to eat, so I’m just gonna go for all of ‘em! I’ll try this chocolate with a drawing on the wrapping first! *Nom, nom*…

Mmm~!! It’s so good that it gets me right back on my feet! Okay, time to try this one!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Nazuna surprised %}
Woah— You’re gobbling them all up. Were you that hungry?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mitsuru niyaclosed %}
Heh! I have a separate stomach for bread and tasty food~♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tomoya glare %}
No need to brag… Jeez, I can’t believe you’re gobbling up all those expensive sweets like they’re just junk food…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tomoya awkward %}
I’m so sorry, Tomoe-senpai. We don’t mean to look so ungrateful for all the refreshments you brought.

{% bubble Hiyori grin %}
No need to worry about that. It’s quite refreshing to see his manner of eating!

Come now, eat as much as you like. Go ahead and eat them up like a starving puppy…☆
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Jun glare %}
Why do you always have to say unnecessary stuff… Which one are you going to eat, Ohii-san?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Hiyori grin %}
I’ll have the quiche! I need my black tea with it too. ♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Jun yare %}
I just knew you’d say that. I was right to bring quiche with me.

It’s gotta be warmed up in the microwave, so I’ll brew the tea first.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Hajime %}
Shall I prepare the tea for him? I’ve already brought the boiled water from the kitchen~♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Jun v3 %}
Are you sure…? Aight, I’ll gladly take your kind offer, then.

I’ll be back shortly, so Ohii-san, please behave yourself, okay?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Hiyori hmphleft %}
I know that! Come on now, Jun-kun, just go already!

Good grief… I’m always well-behaved. *Jun-kun’s* the one who says unnecessary things!

{% bubble Nazuna awkward %}
Woah, Hajime-chin, don’t yell.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Hajime worried %}
Ah— I’m so sorry, I was just so surprised…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Hiyori %}
Whatever are you talking about? I’m curious now, so you should let me in the loop!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Nazuna %}
Oh yeah, Eve was in that program too, right?

Remember that special program about idols experiencing life in the countryside, that was requested by the local government?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Hiyori smug %}
Of course. Why, I’m even the one who named the spring water in that countryside’s mountain “Aqua of Hiyori”!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Hajime smile %}
Ahh, I know about that. It seems like it’s become a tourist spot now.

When we had a photoshoot around that location, we also helped with making the pathway to the spring water. ♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Hiyori nod %}
Oh? I see I contributed to renovating the area without my knowing — All the more proof that I’m a true professional…♪

So what happened to that rural area? You sounded very surprised earlier…?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Nazuna srsthinking %}
Yeah, well… I heard about this from the staff who worked on the program, but—

The family farm that took us in for a while… Apparently, the cabbages they grew are in critical condition.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Hiyori curious %}
Eh? What do you mean? Was it a bad harvest? Even though <em>I</em> helped with planting all those seeds? What terrible weather!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Nazuna frown %}
Actually, it’s the direct opposite. They’ve got the largest harvest of all time.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Hiyori smileconfident %}
Oh, you had me worried for a second. It’s actually excellent weather. ♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Jun serious %}
No, no, we can’t say that for sure… Anyway, Ohii-san, I brought you your quiche~
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Hiyori hmphleft %}
You’re late! You’re so cheeky, Jun-kun, making me wait this long!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Jun frown %}
It’s not my fault, there was a huge queue for the microwave. I can’t cut the line to get back here faster, that’d just be bad manners.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Jun serious %}
Anyway, back to the topic at hand. It sounds like you think an abundance of crops is a good thing, Ohii-san—

But apparently, there’s a limit to that sorta thing. Once you exceed it, it’ll cause a price drop ‘cause of an oversupply, which means a negative profit to the farmers~

In the worst case, they’ll have to destroy their crops before shipping ‘em.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Hiyori %}
My, it isn’t like you to say something so smart, is it? Even though you can only name four prefectures.[^1]
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Jun frown %}
I saw a photo of a tractor crushing cabbages when I was young, and it was a real shock to me. Like, “what’re they doing to all those crops that took so long to grow”…

But I’m aware by now that there were actual reasons to doing that, ‘course~
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Hiyori srsthinking %}
Mm~… Even so, it’s cruel to dispose of all those crops that were nurtured with care.

I still remember how delicious all the vegetables in the family farm’s meals were; you could feel the love poured into them.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Jun frown2 %}
But there’s nothing we can do about it, is there? Produce only stays fresh for so long, so they can’t leave ‘em around forever.

If I was in their position, I’d get rid of ‘em too. I wouldn’t risk going in the negatives ‘cause of an abundance of crops…

Even stores wouldn’t bother with products that can only be sold for dirt cheap, so~?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Hiyori srsthinking %}
…………
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Hiyori smile %}
…Oh, I know! If stores won’t sell it, <em>I</em> will!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Jun curious %}
Hah?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Hiyori smileconfident %}
It’s a noble’s duty to show pity and guide the citizens suffering in anguish, you know!

And most importantly, those crops grew thanks to <em>my</em> efforts of planting them! It would be a loss to the whole world if they didn’t make it to the market!

Mhm, mhm, I have to be the one to rescue them. ♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Jun frown %}
Except the seeds you planted were for <em>turnips</em>, and then you immediately lost interest and put the rest of the work on me, didn’t you~?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Jun snicker %}
Besides, *Ohii-san* selling <em>cabbages</em>… Haha.

That’s just impossible, it’s beyond anyone’s wildest dream~ You’ve never done typical manual work before, have you?

You literally pushed even the field work onto me. So all this just sounds like a complete joke to me.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Hiyori frustrated %}
You’re just saying whatever you like, aren’t you! So annoying~!

I <em>will</em> rescue those crops from their critical condition with my own power! I’ll make sure you eat your words, Jun-kun!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Hiyori smile %}
Our break hasn’t ended yet, has it? I’ll first start by contacting a commoner who might know more… Ah, I’ll call Anzu-chan!

Hello, Anzu-chan? Mhm, it’s me! I’d like to speak to you about something!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Jun frown2 %}
…Jeez. As soon as he said “own power”, he went straight to relying on someone…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Nazuna sighdrop %}
Sorry, it’s all ‘cause we started talking about the family farm.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Jun awkward %}
Please don’t worry about it. It’s nothing new.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Jun northinking %}
…Nah, actually, maybe it’s a little different this time. ‘Cause it seems like he’ll be taking on this job without me.

I just hope he doesn’t cause anyone trouble by acting recklessly, is all~
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Nazuna %}
Yeah.  …I’ll watch over him in your stead, Sazanami.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Hajime %}
I’ll help out, too. I can’t stand the thought of all those vegetables being disposed of, after we all went through the effort of growing them.

The family farm has done so much for us; I want to do something for them as well!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Jun v3 %}
Thanks, I appreciate it. Please contact me if he gets out of hand. I’ll come rushing straight away.

Ohii-san’s a pain in the ass and real tough to handle, but he doesn’t mean any harm… Please take good care of him, you two.

There’s the mug, the key-strap, the sports towel, T-shirt, stickers, thermo flask… Plushies in all size options: large, medium, small, and even the jumbo size one—

That’s not all…!? There’s even the tiny palm-sized plushie that sold out immediately, the same one I thought I dreamed up…! It wasn’t just impossible to get, I practically gave up on even *looking at* the thing, yet it’s *right here* before me…!

{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori awkward %}
I-I was looking at the plant. Like, wow, the store this is from uses really good mulch……?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori idle %}
A-…Anyway. Do you know anything about that box over there?

It was on the table before I got here. It’s addressed to me, apparently…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori smile %}
…Did I check inside? Yeah, I did… There were so many different kinds of merchandise for ‘Sumo Cabbage-kun’…♪

…Ah, I know that local government. They’re doing the best they can to revitalize their region, so they’re also proactive with making yuruchara.[^3]

They have a dozen other yurucharas aside from ‘Sumo Cabbage-kun’, so the region is like a birthplace for yuruchara…

I also watched a bit of that program where idols experience life on the farm. But it didn’t seem like any yurucharas appear in it, so I turned it off midway… What about it?

We only have a limited amount of time, so I’ll get right to the main topic.

I am a savior, and my duty is to rescue the common folk suffering in distress.

{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Hajime %}
…We came in while you were explaining? Then I’ll continue the explanation~♪

Erm, the farmer that took care of us in that program is struggling with an abundance of cabbage crops. It’d be a waste to have it all disposed of, so we were hoping we could help them out somehow.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Hiyori grin %}
Anzu-chan recommended you, as the issue concerns vegetables. Ermm, Takamine-kun, was it? A pleasure to meet you!
{% endbubble %}

## Cycling Road 3

{% bubble Midori serious %}
<th>(…I know about the huge crop disposal. I remember the farmer saying that the market price keeps dropping, and that it’s probably going to be bad business for them at this rate.)</th>
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori sighfrown %}
<th>(But I don’t wanna get involved in this… This was all decided by a bunch of adults after giving it a lot of thought, right? So it’s not like this is a problem we can solve.)</th>
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori srsthinking %}
<th>(But… If I refuse to help, they might take away all the merch I just got…)</th>

<th>(And my family’s greengrocer also owes a lot to the farming business here…)</th>
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori curious %}
…? What is it, Anzu-san? “Sorry for not giving an explanation in advance, you don’t have to take this job if you’re against it”…?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori serious %}
…………

…I’m… not against it. I don’t want Sumo Cabbage-kun’s beloved cabbages to go to waste, either…

But what do you plan to do? How will you avoid having them all disposed of?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori frown %}
If nobody has any ideas, I don’t want to do it… Getting people’s hopes up only to disappoint them wouldn’t benefit either side…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Hiyori smug %}
Fufu. I’ve already got an idea prepared. I’m not so foolish as to take on a challenge without one!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Hiyori smileexplain %}
Anzu-chan told me already, actually. It isn’t anything new for the market price to drop due to an abundance of crops, correct?

But still! I don’t want to simply stand by and watch them fall to their fate. I refuse to live a life of regret, wishing I had done something while I still could!

We don’t have to save every one of them. Even if it’s only just a little, it’s still our victory if we manage to rescue those cabbages from disposal!

But I plan to sell them <em>all</em>, of course. And I’ll need Takamine-kun in order to achieve that. I’d like your assistance!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori idle %}
My assistance…?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Hiyori nod %}
Mhm, mhm! I didn’t know the price of cabbages so I had someone look it up, and it seems like their value has already gone down.

So we’ll have to use its cheap price as its selling point. To be more specific, we’ll sell our whole stock by providing recipes that use up a lot of cabbages!

And you were from a greengrocer, weren’t you? I presume your family business makes a living off of selling vegetables.

I’d like you to provide me a place to sell the cabbages, as a means to test-run my plan. ♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori curious %}
Erm, so you’d like to use our store…? But that doesn’t have anything to do with needing my help, does it…?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Hiyori smilesoft %}
It certainly does. Only <em>you</em> are suited for the task of negotiation; it’s your own family after all!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Nazuna norsmile %}
But it would be rude to just borrow the place, so we’ll also be there as vendors.

Could you please ask them if we could rent the store this Saturday or Sunday?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori serious %}
…I don’t have to ask, I can be the one to decide that. I’m partially taking on the greengrocer business, so…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori northinking %}
But what do you mean by “recipes that use a lot of cabbages”…? Something like cabbage roll or coleslaw salad…?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Hiyori smileexplain %}
That’s what I’ll be brainstorming today. I’d like a sweets recipe, you see! Cabbage is sweet, after all.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori srsthinking %}
Cabbage sweets…? I’ve never heard of that before, though…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Hiyori smileconfident %}
If one doesn’t exist, then I will simply just have to make it! There’s no such thing as “impossible” in my dictionary!

We’ll think up a design and have my family’s chef make a recipe out of it!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori curious %}
Ehh, you’re leaving the actual recipe to someone else…?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Hiyori smile %}
Use every tool you have in your inventory! That’s what it means to assign roles to the right person.

Ah. I know someone who’s the CEO of a sweets company, so we could have them manufacture a large quantity, and sell it in the store!

We’d burn through the cabbages by manufacture, and the customers can try the dessert for themselves. It’s the perfect bargain. ♪

By the way, Shino-kun, why on Earth do you keep putting your hand up and down? What’s the matter?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Hajime worried %}
I-I’m sorry. I thought up a design for the sweets, but I didn’t want to interrupt you…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Nazuna awkward %}
I feel you~ Tomoe’s been talking the whole time so far, so it’s hard to join the conversation.
{% endbubble %}

Shinobu-kun, can’t you do substitution jutsu? I want you to become me and go in my stead…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Shinobu worried %}
Uu~ That jutsu involves making a log look like myself, and even if I were to opt for disguising myself instead…

Perhaps I could get away with the appearance through makeup, but I can’t make up for our height difference. They’ll immediately catch on and say, “You suddenly got shorter!?”

Were I a full-fledged ninja, I might’ve been able to accomplish it, though. How shameful of me…

It seems like the farming business and ‘Sumo Cabbage-kun’ were deeply impressed by this cabbage project, and they heard that I’m a fan of the yuruchara, so… They gathered every kind of merchandise they had in their warehouse, and sent it to me.

So I thought, if that’s how much they’re expecting from me, then maybe I’ve got no choice but to buckle down…

Our quality is guaranteed, though… The people who regularly buy from us always praise the quality, too…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Hajime smile %}
My family and I also love your store’s vegetables, Takamine-kun.

They’re extremely tasty, and it really helps out with my family’s expenses because you sell them so cheap for us~♪[^5]
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Hiyori northinking %}
Hmm… The vegetables here are certainly fresh and vibrant.

Most customers are the elderly, and the quality has an established reputation… This means that we need to change our sales strategy.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Hiyori frown %}
After all, these cabbages are high quality, so they’re quite heavy and difficult to carry! I doubt customers can buy that many at a time because of this.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Hiyori smileconfident %}
So instead of only making them come to us, we’ll go to <em>them</em>. If we go someplace far from the shopping district, the people of that area will surely buy from us!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Nazuna norsmile %}
Ah, like a portable store? Yeah, it <em>would</em> be better to have more places to sell…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Nazuna curious %}
Midori-chin, is that okay to do? Do we need permission to sell first?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori idle %}
It’s fine if it’s only the vegetables. But processed foods need the health care department’s permission first, so I don’t think the sweets will be possible…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Hiyori nod %}
Mhm, mhm! Right then, let’s go sell some cabbages! I’ll prepare the car at once. ♪

Takamine-kun, our ride’s here! Come now, let’s get all the cabbages inside!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori takenaback %}
Uhhh…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Hiyori norsmile3 %}
What’s the matter? I’d much rather not carry anything heavy, so it’s <em>your</em> duty to do so!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori worried0 %}
Er, no, that’s a limousine… Are you seriously thinking of selling cabbages with *that?*
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Hiyori norsmile %}
Of course, what other conclusion could there be? I’ve prepared the biggest car the Tomoe household owns all for the sake of stacking up as many cabbages as possible.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Hiyori grin %}
If you won’t carry them in, I’ll have the driver do so! Hey, come over here~ *<th>(waves)</th>*
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori shocked %}
Hold on, hold on! We’re going to sell these cabbages at parks, neighborhoods… Y’know, normal residence areas.

We’ll look <em>way</em> too suspicious if we went there with this car, like, nobody would even come by us…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Hiyori curious %}
My, is that so? Then what sort of car would be suitable here?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori northinking %}
Car…? I’d say a light pickup truck or something…?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Hiyori norsmile %}
We don’t have that at my household. How much does it cost? I’ll have one purchased and brought over immediately.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori frown %}
No, let’s drop that too… If neither of us have a license, we won’t be able to drive it…

Let’s just do it normally with a delivery bicycle. The one over there, with a two-wheeled cart at the back…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Hiyori norsmile3 %}
This? How lovely, it looks interesting~♪

By the way, how do you use this?

{% bubble Midori surprised %}
Wh… Have you never ridden a bicycle before…?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Hiyori nod %}
Mhm!

{% bubble Midori serious %}
…………

…Then I’ll go sell the cabbages; you stay here and tend the store, Senpai.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Hiyori worried %}
Ehhh!? That’s *boring!* I’ll be the one to go and sell them!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori yare %}
But you can’t ride a bicycle…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Hiyori grin %}
You simply just have to teach me how to! It’ll be fine! As you know, I’m a genius, so I’ll acquire the skill in no time. ♪

Er, I don’t actually know you that well, though…

{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori serious %}
Erm, I’ll explain then… First you have to sit on the saddle, and then grip the handles… Then, if you put your feet on the pedals and paddle down… it should move.

The parts next to the handles are the brakes… those levers are there to slow down the bicycle or to stop it moving. The right side is for the front wheel, and the left is for the back…

When you want to use the brakes, make sure to brake with the left side first, and only press down on the right side once you’ve slowed down.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Hiyori norsmile %}
Hmm~ So I can’t slow down from the right side first?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori serious %}
If you try to stop with only the front wheel, you’ll go facefront and possibly fall down…

Rather than which brake to hit, what’s important is to avoid braking too hard… That’s also why it’s best that you don’t speed up too much, either. You won’t be able to control the bicycle…

That’s the run-down, I guess… How about you try getting on it for now…?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Hiyori fist %}
Mhm, I’ll learn best by doing. ♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Hiyori curious %}
Mm, this seat is as rock-hard as a shabby folding chair…? I think my rear will feel sore after this.

{% bubble Midori idle %}
You’ll get used to it… I’m supporting the carrier— the back part, so please try pedalling slowly.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Hiyori curious %}
Like this? Am I pedaling properly?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori idle %}
Yes… While pedaling, try steering the handle slowly to the right…

{% bubble Hiyori smile %}
Ooh, it turned to the right! Which means if I steer to the left—

Woah!

I’m telling you, you can’t make a sharp turn…

Pedaling makes you speed straight ahead, right? Pedal once, and the bicycle moves on its own before it stops. How fascinating!

There was another one at Takamine-kun’s store; is that yours, too?

It’s my dad’s… But he hasn’t been using it at all because of a health issue.

I’m glad he didn’t throw it away. With two bicycles, we can carry twice the amount…

[^3]: Yuruchara; <em>yuru</em> meaning “loose,” “soft,” “laid-back,” + the word “character”. <em>Yuruchara</em> are a type of mascot characters, with their defining feature being that they have very peculiar designs, ranging from bizarre-cute to adorkable. As shown in this story too, they’re well-known for being used all across Japan for PR purposes for companies, prefectures, etc… For more information read more <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/yuruchara" target="_blank">here</a>.
[^4]: Nazuna switches from his usual way of speaking to speak in polite language (keigo) with the customers.

[^6]: Fun fact, Midori’s room was first revealed with this story, and the background can be unlocked through his card!
[^7]: Hiyori literally says “mascot character” in Japanese here. Although similar, it’s a different term from Midori’s favorite type of mascots, known as <em>yuruchara</em> (which are known to have odd but cute designs, unlike the typical mascot characters)
