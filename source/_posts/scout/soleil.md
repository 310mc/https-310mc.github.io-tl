{% bubble Mitsuru %}
—Mm?

Midori-chan, Midori-chan!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
Hm? What’s up, Tenma-kun?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mitsuru %}
One of your plushies fell down! The poor little guy is all on its own\~! Here you go\~♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
Wha!? —Ah, you’re right! Thank you.

I’m so sorry for dropping you on the floor, Pen-tagon…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mitsuru %}
Ahaha, is it called that ‘cuz it’s a pentagon-shaped penguin? That’s sooo weird~
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
Exactly! It doesn’t make any sense, right!?

It’s so stiff-looking without the round shape of a penguin, and yet the mascot still acts exactly like a penguin would! It’s adorable!

I just love the contrast in the design so much, it’s the cutest bestest thing in the world~☆
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mitsuru %}
Ohhh~? I’ve never seen you this eager before! It’s kinda refreshing!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
Ah—I’m sorry… I blabbered nonstop… I can’t hold myself back whenever I’m excited.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mitsuru %}
‘s all good, I know how you feel\~! I get just as excited about my interests, like, I can’t hold in the urge to dash all over the place\~♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
Ah, personally, I wouldn’t run around, but… I’m glad you get me~♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tsumugi hidden %}
Excuse meee\~... Could someone open the door\~?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
Hm? Did someone say something just now?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mitsuru %}
Yeah, someone asked for the door to be opened!

Okie-dokie~! I’ll open it now, gimme a sec!

…Um, why’s there a cardboard box at the door?

Wowie\~! Midori-chan, Midori-chan, look\~! A cardboard box ghost came to visit us\~!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
Ummm… Isn’t it just someone carrying a lot of boxes? I can’t see who it is, though.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tsumugi hidden %}
Yes, that’s correct, Takamine-kun. Um, could I come inside now, please~?

I can’t carry these boxes any longer… I feel like I could lose my grip any moment now.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mitsuru %}
Oh—! I can see a face from the side! And that voice sounds like Aoi-chan-senpai!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
Woah, woah—! Be careful!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mitsuru %}
Aoi-chan-senpai, we’ll help ya out~!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tsumugi %}
Ahh, thank you so much, this is a huge help.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mitsuru %}
Here we go\~ Hm? Wow, these huge boxes aren’t so heavy after all! Carrying them is no-problem-o\~
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
Oh, you’re right… Veggie boxes are waaay heavier than this…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tsumugi %}
Ahh, that’s because there are sweets inside, so they’re easy to carry one by one.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mitsuru %}
Huh!? Sweets!?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
Are you planning to eat it all, Aoba-senpai? It seems too much for one person, though…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mitsuru %}
Then I’ll help ya get through ‘em~! ♪ We’ll be able to eat them all if we share!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tsumugi %}
Ahaha, neither of us can eat these.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mitsuru %}
We can’t? What do you mean?

Mmm… Is this a riddle? I don’t get it~
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tsumugi %}
Oh no, no. Umm, you see, I’m going to need them for a workshop that ES is hosting next Sunday.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mitsuru %}
Workshop?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tsumugi %}
Yes, we’ve invited children to come visit ES for a field trip.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
Ooh… Like, the typical touring around the place and seeing how people work in the company?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tsumugi %}
Yes, you could say that.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mitsuru %}
Huuuh… Okay, but then why sweets?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tsumugi %}
Well, it’s Halloween soon, right? So we’re planning to have the children wear costumes so that we can hand out sweets to them.

It fits the season and all, and we figured it’d make the kids happy, so I decided to split the sweets into their own wrappings as hand-outs. It’ll be like a small souvenir for them.

I was planning to do the wrapping at the office, but I had another job to deal with first…

But I won’t be able to make it without making use of my free time, so that’s why I’ll be doing it now.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mitsuru %}
Ooh~ —Ah! Then I’ll help you out, Aoi-chan-senpai!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tsumugi %}
Wha—? No, no, I’d feel bad. It’d just be volunteer work, you know? I don’t have anything rewarding for this… Also, I’m sure you’re busy with end-of-the-year plans, aren’t you?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mitsuru %}
I’m not busy this week, though~! Also, I don’t want a reward for helping.

I just wanna help make all the little kiddies be super duper dazzled by us idols!

Wouldn’t it be awesome if we could inspire all of them to become idols too when they grow up~!?

Plus, you look super tired, Aoi-chan-senpai! You’ll be able to rest a li’l if I help out, right?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
Um, Aoba-senpai… I don’t think I’ll be able to help as much as Tenma-kun, but I could at least help with splitting the sweets into their own wrappings…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tsumugi %}
Thank you so much. Alright, I’d like to take up on your word then.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mitsuru %}
Mhm~! You can aaalways count on me!

—Ah! I don’t want money or anything, but if there are any sweets left over, I’d love to have ‘em!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tsumugi %}
Hehe, that’s completely alright with me. I’ll prepare some sweets for you good boys, too.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mitsuru %}
Woohoo\~! ♪ Ah, but that’d be more like Christmas than Halloween\~
