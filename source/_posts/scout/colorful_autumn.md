{% bubble Tetora %}
Ossu! Today’s another day to get through with all my energy~♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori sad3 %}
………
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora surprised %}
Woah— Midori-kun!? Why’re you just standing still right at the door?

I ended up hitting my nose real hard…! I hope it’s not turning red from a bruise…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori sad3 %}
………
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora angry %}
Midori-kuuun~? You’re worrying me now, you’re not moving an inch! You’re like a robot that’s out of battery. Seriously, what’s wrong…?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
Ahh… Tetora-kun… G’morning…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora %}
Morning~☆ So you’re fine after all, huh?

Well, no, that’s not right… you look pretty pale. Did you not sleep enough? You shouldn’t stay up late, or else you won’t get any taller, y’know~?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
I’d gladly take that chance and stay up late if it’ll shrink my height…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori smirk %}
I don’t wanna get any bigger than I am now… I’d rather be a Daphnia[^1]…♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora %}
Uumyu… It’s a luxury to be able to worry over somethin’ like that. But just ‘cuz Ryuseitai is on break right now doesn’t mean you should be lazing about.

Taichou may give us proper breaks, but we could get a job at any moment.

It’s good to live a proper life so that you’re prepared for any job.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori sad %}
You’re talking to me like I really <em>did</em> stay up late… Then again, I was forced to cook until late at night yesterday and the day before that, so I can’t really deny it…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora %}
Huh? Midori-kun, you cook at home? That’s really admirable! I wanna do the same, too!

…Except, whenever I try to cook at home, my parents immediately rush over to stop me.

They beg me with tears in their eyes, saying “Stop burning the pot already!” and it makes me feel like I did somethin’ bad.

Even though helping ‘round the house is a good thing, they make me feel guilty like I’m being a bother. I don’t get it at all~…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
I think your parents were in the right to do that, though… You get stopped by Morisawa-senpai, too…

Mm~… Tetora-kun, do you know about the autumn fair happening in the shopping district…?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora %}
Oh yeah, there were leaflets ‘bout that all ‘round the district. Is that what you’ve been helping out with?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
Yeah… Every year, they make the fair centered around a certain store… and this year, bad luck fell on me, and ended up being the greengrocers’…

What’s even worse is that from this year on, the district wants to put <em>way</em> more effort into the fair than last year… They planned the whole thing without even considering how much of a bother it’d be, and now I’m being forced to do work at my home for days on end…

Thankfully, my parents entrusted the signboard order to a professional, but they left me with all the cooking for the fair…

And I know veggies are good and all, but <em>that</em> many in one dish feels like a stomach ache bound to happen…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora %}
Ah, so the cooking’s centered around veggies, huh.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
We’re a greengrocers store, after all… If it was a butcher’s shop it’d be centered around meat, but that would mean a lack of any other nutrition…

Well, pumpkins and sweet potatoes are popular regardless of age or gender, and I was thinking of using the season’s matsutake mushroom as a way to attract customers…

Domestically produced matsutake mushrooms are expensive, though, so I can’t use too much…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora %}
The autumn season has all the tasty food, after all~

I feel hungry now from all the food talk, even though I ate a good meal for breakfast. Weird, huh?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
I made some glacé with the leftover carrots; do you want it…? There’s even carrot kinpira… You can have it if you like…?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora %}
Eek!? I can’t stand carrots, so I <em>seriously</em> don’t want that!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
You sure? It’s tasty, though… Maybe I’ll keep it for lunch break…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora %}
Yeah, yeah, that’s a great idea!

But making food every day for the fair sounds rough. If Ryuseitai had a job on top of that, you’d have broken down…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
I know, right… And here I thought I’d get to do nothing but laze around all day… That plan lasted two seconds before it got crushed, and now I only feel my depression getting stronger…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora %}
Eh~? You may say that, but you seem more bored than anything when there’s nothing to do in Ryuseitai…

If you have free time, then shedding sweat in your club or helping out at home is the valuable way to spend it~♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
Doing nothing all day is also a valuable way to spend your time, though…

Most customers go to the shops downtown, so they wanna put more effort into the fair in hopes of getting the customers to come back to the district… Kinda complicated if you ask me…

The huge crowd will only last a little while… Once the fair is over, they won’t be coming back again…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora %}
Do you not feel excited for the autumn fair, Midori-kun?

It sounds like you’re cooking the food to make the fair more hype, so it’s not like you’re completely unmotivated, right?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
Well, I’m gonna get a little reward… But more importantly, I’m so excited to see the signboard done that I can’t even sleep…♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora %}
Ooh, now you look happy! I’m curious to see what kinda signboard it is~♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
Sorry, the data’s in the laptop at home, so I can’t show you.

My parents told me I could think of what kinda design to make, so I put every bit of effort into it…♪

Instead of using free stock images, a handmade drawing would make people grow attached to it…

I wanted to ask Anzu-san to draw the design, since she’s amazing at drawing mascots… but I didn’t have the time, so I ended up designing them in the end…

With an illustration I can look at, I should be able to manage a demonstration of our products, too… I’m not sure what I’d say, but, well… As long as I keep smiling, I’ll make it through somehow…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora %}
The autumn fair’s this weekend, right? I’ll invite everyone from Ryuseitai to meet up there!

If you don’t have enough helping hands, just let us know. We’d be glad to help out~♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
Ughh… I feel like if Morisawa-senpai finds out about this, he’ll say “There was no need to hold back, Takamine!” and barge right into my house…

I bet my parents would be super happy about it too, and I wouldn’t have any time to skip out on work…

I think he can probably tell by now, but try not to let him know about this until the day of the fair…

For now, my work with the fair is just cooking, so it’s not like I’m so busy that I need all the help I can get…

But… If we end up having a lot of customers on the day of the fair, then I might need some help… Can I ask you to spare a hand if something like that happens…?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora %}
‘Course! You’re my friend after all, I’d be happy to help you out~♪
{% endbubble %}

## Chapter 7

{% bubble Tetora %}
…………

Ahh, sorry for spacing out. Watching Shinkai-senpai and Kanzaki-senpai talk to each other made me miss Taishou a bit.

Taishou always praises me with comments like “You did well, Tetsu”, but he doesn’t ever pat my head that way, and I got a bit envious.

Woah— Anego!? D-Don’t just pat my head outta nowhere like that!

Ahaha, “If you don’t mind me doing it instead”…? You’re kind, Anego.

But if you pat my head when I haven’t done anything, it’ll make me feel a li’l uneasy.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Souma %}
Oh? Anzu-dono and Nagumo are getting along well. That’s just wonderful. ♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata %}
the most important thing is to get along with each other…♪ there’s even all these [vegetables] getting along, as well~
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora %}
Vegetables…? Ahh, Anego’s drawing, right?

Well, now that we’ve all drawn our draft… We just need to show this to Midori-kun, and once we get the OK we draw it on the roll paper, right?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
Heeey, sorry for keeping you all waiting~…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora %}
Ah, Midori-kun! You came just at the right time, we just finished drawing our own versions, so we’d like you to check ‘em out! ♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
Waah, this’ll be exciting… ♪ Then I’ll start from Kanzaki-senpai’s drawings…

Ooh, Kanzaki-senpai, this is your sort of art style, huh? The lines are very firmly drawn, it’s as if it’s a clean copy rather than a draft.

Instead of soft mascots, it looks more like an ink painting…♪ It feels like they could come to life at any moment, it’s pretty cool…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Souma %}
I-Is that so? I’m happy to know you like it. So, is this going to be used as the clean copy?
{% endbubble %}

Mm~… it would’ve been better if it was drawn just a little cuter, though… Like Shinkai-senpai’s~♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Souma %}
I see, so like Buchou-dono’s drawing. I might not be able to copy it right, but I shall give it a shot. Buchou-dono, if you don’t mind, please guide me.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata %}
ufufu, of course, you can leave it to me~…♪ it is [refreshing] to teach you about things other than the [club]~

souma, follow after me.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Souma %}
Of course. If that is Buchou-dono’s order, then I will risk my own life for it. I will not turn my back away from any trials and tribulations!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora %}
Midori-kun, what about mine? Anego also approved of it, so I’m pretty confident of it~♪

Anego? If you keep shaking your head like that, the blood will get to your head, y’know? You’ve been acting weird since a while ago.

I’ll take you to the infirmary~ C’mon, give me your hand! ☆
{% endbubble %}

{% img /img/es/scoutstory/colorfulautumn/midoriorigcg.jpg %}

{% bubble Midori %}
Uwaaaaah…! ☆
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora %}
Woah!? Midori-kun, did you just snatch the paper from my hand!? If you just asked for it I would’ve given it to you! It’s not good to take things by force!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
W-Who… Who drew this?!  Tetora-kun?!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora %}
O-Ossu…? I’m the one who drew the persimmon as a mascot character…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
Uwah, uwaaah…♪ I never thought I’d get to encounter someone close to me with this much artistic talent…!

Thank you, Tetora-kun. I love you…!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora %}
Ehh? I like you too, but…? You’re acting <em>way</em> different than usual, so I don’t really know how to respond…

You’re acting like that one time Anego wore the mascot outfit. You’re way too hyper!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
I can’t help it, I feel like I just experienced a fateful encounter… I wanna put this under my pillow and sleep with it. Give it to me, Tetora-kun~♪

If that’s not okay, then let me burn it right into my retinas…! Actually no, there’s no way I’d forget something as artistic as this! I feel completely absorbed by it…☆

駄目なら網膜に焼きつけるから……！　いや、これほどの芸術的な絵は一度見れば忘れられないよ、病みつきになる……☆
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora %}
I-I’m glad you like it.

I never imagined you’d get <em>this</em> unbelievably happy over it, but it’s okay. A man doesn’t get flustered over trivial things. I’ll calmly accept it, just like Taishou would…☆

But enough of that, our break is almost over after all that talking and drawing. We never really got to eat our food in the end.

There’s only a li’l bit left until classes start, so I’ll eat the bread as fast as I can… *(munch, munch)* ♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
Anzu-san is also eating her bread as fast as she can… Her cheeks are getting all puffy like a hamster…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora %}
Whew, what a good meal! Anego finished her food too, it seems— Oh, the bell rang, we gotta get going~!

Shinkai-senpai and Kanzaki-senpai, you should also get going!

Sorry Midori-kun, I know you came all the way here with the roll paper… Let’s carry it with us to the classroom and bring it back here after classes are over!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
Ahh, yeah. Is it okay if everyone comes back here with their gym uniform…? Alright, then see you later after classes are over…♪
{% endbubble %}

{% note location %}
**Location:** In front of the water fountain (Autumn)
{% endnote %}

{% bubble Kanata %}
*puka, puka…*♪

the water has gone all [cold]~… achoo!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora %}
Ahh, Shinkai-senpai’s bathing in the fountain again! I hope you’re not sneezing from catching a cold…

We may have a break from Ryuseitai activities, but it isn’t good to let your valuable break go to waste like that!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata %}
[tetora] really does say things [chiaki] would say, doesn’t he~?

but, please do not worry…♪

if i let my [clothes] get wet, i will not be able to work. so i am only soaking my [feet] in the [water]…♪

it is going to continue getting [colder], and i will not be able to [bathe] in the water as much~

if my skin [dries] up, i will die. so i must [soak myself] with [water] just like one [stuffs themselves] with [food]…♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora %}
Um, no… We can’t stuff ourselves with food like animals can, so I don’t think it’s possible with water either…?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
Tetora-kun, you forgot the crayons… I also brought the paint… I’ll put it down here, so don’t kick it over, okay?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora %}
Crap, I forgot about that.

Midori-kun, you can carry two paint buckets in your hands so easily! That’s some physical strength you have~♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
Well, I do carry veggies when doing work at my house, after all…

Anzu-san and Kanzaki-senpai don’t seem to be here yet… Let’s get everything ready until they arrive…♪
{% endbubble %}

## Chapter 8

{% bubble Souma %}
Kanzaki Souma has arrived!

I was late because of a prolonged class I had to finish my duties for. The only redemption I could have here is to commit seppuku!

Hm, Anzu-dono. “That would mean I should commit seppuku as well”, you say?

It is true that you were also late, but you have a proper excuse… There’s no reason for you to also commit seppuku alongside me…

Hmm? I was late for the same reason as you, so that would mean I too have no reason to do it?

Ahaha, you make a solid argument. ♪

The lord cutting open their own stomach is an unforgivable act.

If my seppuku would cause Anzu-dono to take her own life as well, then I would much rather bear this disgrace and beg for my life.

Please, I humbly beg for your forgiveness…!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata %}
souma, raise your head.

we only arrived a moment ago too~ no one is angry at you, okay?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
Yeah, we were just in the middle of getting everything ready…

Ah— there’s paint buckets over there, so please be careful. If the paint gets on your uniform, it’ll be really tough to get rid of it…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Souma %}
Thank you for the warning. I see some curled up paper near the paint; could that be the rolled paper?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
Yeah…

We’ll draw the Dossari-chan mascot characters on the paper, then color them in with crayons or paint…♪

I figured out the level of everyone’s art skill, so… Is it okay if Shinkai-senpai and Kanzaki-senpai pair up and draw together?

You’re both in the same club, and you both seem to have great chemistry…♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata %}
ufufu, i am with souma again…♪ souma is a quick [learner], so we will be able to produce results.

let’s cute [drawings] that are just as good as [signatures]\~ hehe\~♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Souma %}
Ooh, Buchou-dono seems to be in an excellent mood! ♪ I feel excited, as well! Let us go forth, Buchou-dono…♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora %}
Midori-kun, should I draw on the roll paper too?

I brought Anego’s drawings too, so I can draw while looking at hers and copy it over~!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
~……♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora %}
Ummm, Midori-kun? Why’re you leaning forward so much like that?

Woah, woah! You’re too close, you’re acting like Taichou! It’s embarrassing to be stared at while drawing, so I’d like it if you distance yourself a li’l~
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
Me… like Morisawa-senpai…? Uughhh, tell me this is a nightmare… Being in the same boat as that touchy-feely being is just depressing…

Maybe if I plunge my head in the water and drown myself, I’ll die easily…?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora %}
Wawa—!! Calm down, Midori-kun!?

I just misspoke earlier, ‘kay? You’re not like Taichou at all, so come on, cheer up! You can do this! Let’s go~♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
I’m too depressed to cheer up… But if Tetora-kun draws while cheering me on, I might get back my motivation…♪
{% endbubble %}

{% img /img/es/scoutstory/colorfulautumn/tetoraorigcg.jpg %}

{% bubble Tetora %}
If that’s all I gotta to make you happy again, then it’s easy-peasy stuff!

…Hrm~ Drawing on a wide paper is pretty tough, huh?

If I draw too small, it won’t be as dynamic, but if I draw too big, it might extend outside the paper.

There’s the burdocks, the sweet potatoes, and the pumpkins… Aight, I managed to draw ‘em pretty well. Oops, can’t forget the chestnuts. And now to draw the persimmons next to it, and it’ll be complete~♪

ごぼう、さつまいも、かぼちゃ……よし、うまく描けたッス。おっと、栗も忘れちゃいけないッスね。柿もお隣に添えて完成ッス～♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
Uwaaah…! ♪ What a messy assembly, and they’re all looking *right at me*…! They’re freaky but I can’t take my eyes off them! Just looking at them makes my heart beat hard~!

It’s absolutely perfect, Tetora-kun…☆ Thank you, it reaaally soothes my heart~…♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora %}
Uu~… I know you’re complimenting me, but somethin’ doesn’t feel right ‘bout it. Oh well, as long as it cheered you back up.

As for Anego… Ohh, she managed to finish up a bunch of papers while I was finishing my first one.

At this rate, Anego’s drawings will be enough to get the amount we need.

It’s prolly more efficient that she does the drawings, and Midori-kun and I work on the coloring.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
It’s a shame this is all I can get of Tetora-kun’s masterpieces, but it’s okay… I still have the drawing you drew during lunch break…

And I have Anzu-san’s art, too… Heheheh, I’m making such a good collection~♪

Anzu-san, can I color this…? Ahh, you already have some drawings that are completed, okay.

So can I give these to you, Tetora-kun…?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora %}
‘Course, leave it to me~♪ Time to dip the brush into the paint and smear~
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
Veggies, veggies… Hmhmhmm~♪ *(Humming)*
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora %}
(Midori-kun’s in such a good mood that he’s humming a song while painting.)

(The veggies he’s painting all look bright and tasty~♪)

(But it’s kinda surreal to see veggies with eyes and noses have a speech bubble saying “I’m tasty, eat me~♪”)

(It’s a pretty unique idea to have the selling point as somethin’ like “eat me”…)

(Woops, while I was spacing out, Anego finished drawing and already started a new one.)

(Is that… the persimmon mascot character I drew? I can’t tell, I need to get closer…)

Uhya—!?

I tipped over the paint bucket!?

Ahh, this is a disaster! The paint’s spreading all over the paper!! I have to wipe it off with a cloth… (wipe, wipe)

Oh no, the paint I wasn’t able to clean off is just spreading even further and ruining more papers!! W-wh-what do I dooo~!?

O-Ossu, no. I have to calm down. At times like these, you have to calmly work through it, or it’ll only get worse.

What am I saying, it’s already gotten *worse!* I’m real sorry, Anego…!

You’re glad none of it got on my uniform…? Well, yeah, none of it got on me, but!

I just ruined your drawing, y’know?! You should scold me for that!

I really hate this part ‘bout myself, making clumsy mistakes no matter the time! I should seriously consider doing the zen meditation that Taishou suggested for learning self-restraint.

I wanna be able to deal with any type of situation without freaking out from sudden problems.

Anyway, let me take responsibility for this alone…!

Huh? That’s why these things keep happening to me, you say? I should just let you handle the drawings and I keep working on the coloring?

Ossu, understood! I’ll make sure not to cause you trouble this time, Anego~!
{% endbubble %}

## Chapter 9

{% bubble Kanata %}
midori, tetora\~ we finished [drawing] on the [roll papers] and [coloring] them\~

if there is anything else you [need to do], i will be glad to [help]~
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
Then it’d be great if you could help with more coloring…

Anzu-san’s drawing pretty quickly, and we don’t have enough people to finish coloring them…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Souma %}
Hm, so we must color the drawings over here? Leave it to me, I will finish them up promptly. ♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora %}
Slooowly, caaarefully… so that the paint doesn’t spill outta the line-art…

I’m not really good at work that requires precision, but that’s exactly why I shouldn’t avoid doing it. Being a man among men means overcoming your weaknesses…♪

Carrots… are hard for me to overcome mentally, but I’m sure there’ll be a day when I’ll be able to face them. Ossu! A heart that believes can bring about miracles~♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
Hmm\~… With the drawings that Shinkai-senpai and Kanzaki-senpai finished, maybe one or two more drawings will be enough… And then I’ll be able to make it through with the rest on my own\~♪

The two of them are also gonna help me on Saturday with the signboards though, so they’re doing me a huge favor on that day too…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora %}
Midori-kun, you didn’t mention me. It’s our job as the first years to carry the materials! We can’t put all the responsibility on our seniors~!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
Tetora-kun…♪

Huh? Not only Tetora-kun but you too, Anzu-san? But, letting a girl carry something so heavy might be a little too much…

Fweh? Well, it is true that it’d be a great help to have someone stick all the roll paper onto the signboard…

But you’ve already done so much with just the drawing part… If I rely on you for even that, I’ll feel really bad for making you work for no reward…

Maybe I’ll negotiate with my parents if all of you can get paid… It’s my parents’ fault that this ended up happening anyway…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora %}
Hm~…? I hear somethin’ coming from your pocket, Midori-kun. It sounds like a phone ringing…?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
Who could it be at a time like this…?

Hello…? Ah, yeah… The preparations for the signboards are going well… I don’t have the materials with me right now, so the actual signboards will be put up on the day of the fair…

I got help from my classmate and seniors with the drawings, so I can manage the rest by myself…

Actually, it’s a good thing you called… I was just thinking about how I need to pay them back for all the help they’ve done, so I’m wondering if there’s some pay I could give them…

Wha— You’ll pay them from <em>my</em> allowance? Ughhh, you monsters… What? You’re just joking? Stop it, that stuff’s really bad for my heart…

Okay, I’ll also let them know about the meal thing… But please don’t go <em>too</em> far with it. Yeah, see you…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora %}
Midori-kun, was that a call from your parents?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
Yeah… They were asking about how the signboard making is going…

And then I told them about how you all helped me… They wanna repay everyone, so they told me to invite you guys to dinner at my house…

They’re being such a pain about it…

My mom was really obnoxiously enthusiastic about it, saying “How many are there? I’ll make enough for everyone, so bring them all over!”…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora %}
Dinner? Huh, I got so caught up with our work that I didn’t realize the sun’s going down.

It would still be bright right ‘bout now if we were in the summer, but the days are getting shorter in autumn, huh~

I didn’t eat enough during lunch, so I’m starving. If your mom says it’s okay, then I’d love to come over~♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Kanata %}
i would like [fish]~ [fish] are food. we should eat them until only [bones] are left behind…♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Souma %}
The fish that I have prepared should still be in the refrigerator of the kitchen… Wait a moment, I’ll bring it over in a cooler box!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
I did hear about someone who brings fish to school, and that someone was Kanzaki-senpai, huh…

He said it was prepared, so that might mean he made it into sashimi…? As long as I don’t have to look at any googly eyes, I’m good with fish…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora %}
Now that we have the fish and vegetables, I’m craving for meat. It reminds me of that barbeque we had at the Pirate Festival!

It was fun when Taichou kept shoving all the eggplants onto my plate, and I shoved all the carrots back~

This dinner’s not gonna be like a barbeque, but it’ll be among close friends…

Kanzaki-senpai is good friends with Sengoku-kun, and most importantly, in the same unit as Taishou.

Which means he knows stuff ‘bout Taishou that I don’t, right? I wanna ask him all ‘bout it~♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
Meat, huh… There’s a butcher's shop we’re well-acquainted with in the neighborhood; wanna buy some there…?

The old man working there is a really generous person, so I’m sure he’ll give us extra on top… He also sells croquettes…

Maybe they don’t think about the profit much, but the croquettes cost around 50 yen, and there’s a lot of them… so I usually grab a few to fill myself whenever I’m coming home from club activities.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora %}
You’re in the Basketball club, so it makes sense you do that. You move around a lot during club activities, so you burn through a lot of calories and get hungry just as much, huh?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
Yeah, pretty much… But I’ll grow bigger if I eat meat, so I feel conflicted about it…

I’m still in puberty, so it’s scary that I could possibly grow even bigger… But avoiding meat means a lack of protein…

Why am I so freakishly huge…? It’s so depressing, I wanna die…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora %}
Uu~, I really feel like it’s <em>such</em> a luxury to worry ‘bout somethin’ like that! I’m itching to grow bigger and stronger like Taishou, but I don’t grow no matter how much milk I drink.

I’d love to switch places with ya, y’know~?

…Just kidding, there’s no point in feeling envious. I’m me. I can’t be anyone else~♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori %}
Yeah… I may get depressed over my extreme height, but there’s no way to shrink, so… I’m gonna continue to live with this kind of body forever…

Well, there are times it’s got its merits, anyway… and times that it isn’t of course, like bumping my head…

Anyway, good job everyone…♪ I’ll need your help on the day of the fair as well, and my repayment for all that will be nothing compared to your hard work, but…

Please eat as much as you like, and enjoy yourselves…♪
