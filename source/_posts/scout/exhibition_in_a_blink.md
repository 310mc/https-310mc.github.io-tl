    <p>One day in early March…</p>
</div>

{% bubble Midori sighfrown %}
Whew. It’s finally over…

The photoshoot dragged on for so long… I just couldn’t draw out the right nuance for the photos… or more like, my synergy with the photographer wasn’t great…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori smile %}
But now I have the rest of today and tomorrow off… Things have been so hectic lately, so I’m glad I can finally take it easy while hugging all my yuruchara plushies…♪[^1]
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Rei srsthinking %}
…………

Hm. This painting is truly riddled with many mysteries…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori curious %}
<th>(Huh? That’s Sakuma-senpai… What’s he doing with that picture frame?)</th>

<th>(Eh, not that it matters much to me… It’d only be a pain if he starts up a conversation, so I’ll just hurry back to my room and relax with my phone.)</th>
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Rei %}
…Now, now. Don’t try to leave with such haste as soon as you see me, Takamine-kun.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori surprised %}
Uwah— You noticed…?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Rei snicker %}
Kukuku. Who do you take me for? Sensing someone’s presence is child’s play for me.

It must be some sort of fate that we met each other here… This is perfect timing; take a good look at this painting here.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori worried0 %}
Ehh… Why me…?

I remember you doing this back during Music Festa too, but you always talk to me at the exact moment that I *don’t* want to be perceived…[^2]
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Rei grin %}
Ah, that takes me back. Takamine-kun would always shrink back in fear upon seeing Sena-kun and I. You would yell, “Save me, Morisawa-senpai!” over every little thing.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori glare %}
Please stop making up false memories.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Rei %}
Nevertheless, this is the painting I was looking at. It is excellently crafted, don’t you think?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori sightired %}
<em>And</em> he’s not listening to me…

Umm, it’s a painting of a woman smiling in a beautiful landscape…? It looks like a regular painting to me, but is there something up with it?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Rei smilesoft %}
Well, you see. This painting is said to “make one drop dead upon gazing at it three times”.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori surprised %}
Mm—!?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Rei nod %}
Here. Take another close look. ♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori horrified %}
GWAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH!?

W-Wh— Why’d you show it to me *twice!?* Are you trying to kill me…!?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Rei smileconfident %}
It’s such a beautiful painting; I simply could not help myself…♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori worried0 %}
*I’m* the one who’s going to need help, at this rate!?

And why do you even have a painting like that, anyway… That’s way too disturbing…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Rei %}
I found this painting lying untouched while I was helping clean the storehouse of an acquaintance’s home.

I, too, had little interest in the artwork at first, but then I noticed that ES’s sandbank is painted in the background.

That was when the owner thought that this must be some sort of sign, so they requested that I investigate in detail everything there is to know about this painting.

Not only could there be historical value within it, but as a member of the Mystery Researchers Club, it became of great intrigue to me.

Thus, it is necessary to investigate who painted this, and for what purpose.

And so, Takamine-kun. What say you and I work together to discover the truth behind this painting? Now that you’ve seen the artwork for yourself, surely it’s piqued your interest, too?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori v2 %}
No, it has <em>not</em>. Please put away that painting already and go someplace else…!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Rei curious %}
Oh? Was it a little too shocking for you, Takamine-kun?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Rei frown %}
My invitation has been declined by various people thus far, starting with Ritsu… It makes me feel so lonely…

No one has shown interest; saying they’ve got a fear of horror, are too busy with work, or anything else of the like.

I’m shocked that nobody would give me the time of day when such a mystical painting is right before them. We live in a harsh era where time is money…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori frown2 %}
Of course nobody would… If you suddenly show them a painting that’ll make them drop dead if they look at it three times, they wouldn’t want to kill time by helping you.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Rei yare %}
I suppose I have no choice now… I’ll have to display this painting in the Starmony Dorm.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori shocked %}
No, no! Why do you wanna show it so badly!? If you do that, not only will I die, but the entirety of Starmony Dorm will be annihilated…!?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Rei sightired %}
Nobody cared to clear my troubles, so this is my means of venting my frustrations. Ahh, if only someone had extended a hand to me before it would end like this~…?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Rei smileconfident %}
Peek, peek *<th>(Peeks his head in and out from the back of the frame)</th>*
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori sighfrown %}
<th>(What an actual pest…)</th>
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori srsthinking %}
<th>(Uuu, I really just can’t handle talking with people I don’t know well…)</th>

<th>(I’m better at talking to people than I used to be, but it still wears me out… I wanna muster the courage to turn down his request…)</th>

<th>(But… what if people really <em>will</em> die if they look at that painting three times…?)</th>
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori serious %}
…Fine. I just have to investigate this painting with you, right…?

But only for today, okay? I don’t have time to help you every day…

Ooh, I’m pleased to know you’re willing to accompany me, Takamine-kun. ♪

Right then, let us conduct our investigation as part of the Mystery Researchers Club.

The owner of this “makes one drop dead upon gazing at it three times” painting — Also known as the “Mysterious Portrait” — will surely be overjoyed to hear this, too. ♪

## Portrait Shrouded in Mystery 2

{% img /img/es/scoutstory/blinkexhibition/2.jpg %}

{% bubble Midori surprised %}
Whaa!? It was all a lie when you said that people die after looking at this painting three times…!?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Rei %}
Indeed it was. If that was <em>truly</em> the case, we would have corpses lying around everywhere.

There lies a mystical air within this painting that is past its prime— So in that sense, it wouldn’t be surprising to learn if it had exaggerated rumors surrounding it.

However, it was all said in jest. I have gazed at this artwork many times by now.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori sigh %}
Ah, I see… <em>Sigh</em>… I got all anxious over nothing…

But why would you even do that…? Was there really any need to try and scare people with that joke?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Rei grin %}
Everyone sees themselves as pitiful, no? I was trying to attract people’s interest to this painting by deliberately alluding to a dangerous mystery that could cause harm.

I am also weak to sunlight, and investigating all on my own would be extremely difficult to accomplish.

That is why I thought of finding a kind-hearted ally to assist me… And that’s when you showed yourself, Takamine-kun. ♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori sad2 %}
This is so depressing… *That’s* why I was forced to do this…?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Rei smile %}
But it piqued your interest, did it not? Here, take another look at this painting that will <em>not</em> make you drop dead even if you’ve gazed at it three times — Sear it into your eyes. ♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori frown %}
Please stop that already. Even if the rumor was just a joke, I don’t really wanna look at it so much…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori curious %}
Anyway, Sakuma-senpai. Where are we even headed…?

You said we’d go on an investigation in ES, so does that mean you’ve got a hunch who you could ask?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Rei %}
Mm. Regarding that… I had been waiting for a response back from a few colleagues while I was gazing at the painting in the Starmony Dorm. There is someone I’ve contacted that is currently investigating the painting over at the Information Room.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori shocked %}
Whaa…? So you’ve got other allies?

Then couldn’t you have just left me be…?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Rei %}
Come now, what harm is there in having more helping hands? I also have my own life to deal with, and I can’t afford to fixate on this painting all day.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori curious %}
Um, I’ve also got my own life to deal with…?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Rei smile %}
You certainly do. That is exactly why I’ve requested your help during your time off.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori awkward %}
Uh, right.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori sighdrop %}

{% img /img/es/scoutstory/blinkexhibition/3.jpg %}

{% bubble Rei %}
Yuuki-kun. Have you finished investigating?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Makoto %}
Hello, I hope you’ve been doing well, Sakuma-senpai! Yeah, I’m almost done.

…Huh, Takamine-kun? Why are you just standing there at the door, looking so frustrated?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori frown %}
Don’t mind me, please carry on… I was just suddenly dragged into this…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Makoto %}
Ah, yeah, Sakuma-senpai sometimes does things out of left field, doesn’t he?

But he doesn’t do it to be mean; it’s actually done with good intentions, so it’s something to be grateful for.

So maybe there’s a deeper reason why he asked you to help him out with this, Takamine-kun.

When I did intensive training under UNDEAD‘s guidance, they made me go bungee jumping, and it was a rough time for me then, too… But it’s still a good memory for me to this day, I think.[^3]
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Makoto awkward %}
…Actually, can I really say that… it was a good memory…?
{% endbubble %}

{% img /img/es/scoutstory/blinkexhibition/midoriorigcg.jpg %}

{% bubble Midori sighfrown %}
Please don’t start questioning your own words…

Anyway, I’m aware that Sakuma-senpai isn’t a bad person or anything…

But it tires me out to be suddenly dragged around from place to place, and I’m getting mentally worn out from the stress of trying to communicate…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Makoto nod %}
Ah! I feel you so bad~ Our MP drains the longer we spend time with other people, right?

But don’t worry. I was also curious about this painting, so I’ve already done some research. I think that if all goes well, you’ll be released from this investigation soon too, Takamine-kun.

Sakuma-senpai, could I start by asking you to look at the printout I gave you?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Rei %}
Hm… This is an archive of the public national exhibitions. This painting… I see, the painting style here is similar to our ‘Mysterious Portrait’, isn’t it?

This would mean that this artist is the one behind the painting in question, correct?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Makoto %}
Yep. I had to really dig deep for info since there’s no digital data of the painting. I used the date written on the back of the frame as a clue, and looked through that year’s public exhibitions.

I had to go to a huge library, so it was rough rummaging through all the illustrated books they had… But I managed to find the person who created the painting in the end.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori v3 %}
But just because the painting style is the same doesn’t necessarily mean that it’s the same person behind it, does it?

Artists tend to take in a pupil… So it’s possible that this painting was drawn by someone who copied the mentor’s style.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Makoto %}
Mhm, I was wondering about that too. But the signatures on the two paintings are the same, so I don’t think we’re off the mark here.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Rei %}
Hm. Indeed, there’s a signature drawn on the edge of the frame. Takamine-kun, see for yourself, too.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori sightired %}
Uu… I know I won’t die by looking at it three times, but it still makes me nervous…

But… You’re right, the signature seems to be the same as the one on the painting Yuuki-senpai printed out…?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Rei smile %}
You have my gratitude, Yuuki-kun. Thanks to you, we should be able to reach the truth much faster than expected.

Right then, allow me to contact the artist…♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Makoto shocked %}
Ah— I tried contacting him already. There’s just one problem—

It seems like the artist’s an old man, and he’s currently in the hospital.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Rei curious %}
In the hospital…?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Makoto serious %}
Yes. I tried contacting him by finding his phone number in a telephone directory… And a family member picked up the phone, saying that he’s currently in the hospital and can’t allow any visitors at the moment.

The exhibition his painting was displayed at also happened a few decades ago, so he must be really old by now.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Rei srsthinking %}
What a strange coincidence… Now that you’ve said that, it feels as though this painting intentionally beckoned us, in hopes of making us meet the artist.

Perhaps that is also why I showed extraordinary interest in this painting. As if an unseen force was at work—
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori worried0 %}
Guh— He’s saying something occultish again… I’m not buying it this time, okay…!?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Rei snicker %}
Kukuku. Takamine-kun’s such a worrywart. ♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Rei %}
Regardless, I will try to contact his family myself.

As the one entrusted with this painting, punishment would befall me if I do not take on that task at the very least.

{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mao smilesoft %}
Ooh, Takamine, what’s wrong? You’re holding your head like you’re stressed out~

Did you forget something? If it’s something I’ve got, I can lend it to you~♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori v3 %}
Ah, Isara-senpai… Nah, I didn’t forget anything.

Sakuma-senpai showed me a weird painting the other day, and now I feel like I’ve left something unfinished…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mao curious %}
Weird painting…?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Makoto %}
Ahaha, you’re still thinking about it too, Takamine-kun?

I feel you~ I wanted to know how that painting came about, so I dug around the net after our conversation the other day.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori v3 %}
Ah, you were here too, Yuuki-senpai… Did you come to school with Isara-senpai?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mao %}
Yup. Subaru and Hokuto aren’t around today ‘cause they’ve got their own solo work to do~

Anyway, tell me more about that painting! It’s unusual to see Takamine and Makoto talking to each other about something, and I’m getting curious about it myself~♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori v3 %}
Hah… It’s nothing special, really. But if you don’t mind me explaining it, I’ll do so…
{% endbubble %}

<div class="msr-narration">
    <p>Time passes…</p>
</div>

{% bubble Midori v3 %}
—So, yeah, the artist in question is apparently an old man in the hospital right now.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mao northinking %}
Huh… A painting that has ES’s sandbank painted in the corner of the background…?

Yeah, I’m wondering about the story behind that now, too. Us idols don’t know anything about that land before ES was built—

This is like doing some social studies or something, huh? Like a lesson where we learn about our region.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Makoto %}
Yeah, I accepted Sakuma-senpai’s request for a similar reason. Researching about all of this really satisfies my curiosity.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori v3 %}
Obviously, since we’re talking about a very far past, the land in the painting looks completely different compared to how we know it, now that ES has been built on it…

So it makes me want to learn a lot about what the area was like before ES came around.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Makoto curious %}
Are you sure that’s okay with you? Or are you just following along with our excitement…?

It sounded like you were forced to tag along with Sakuma-senpai two days ago, so you don’t have to force yourself to be part of this, okay?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori v3 %}
No, I was also just really tired back then, ‘cause I had just finished work…

Besides, if Isara-senpai and Yuuki-senpai are here, I think it will soften the load on me when talking with Sakuma-senpai…?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mao smilesoft %}
Haha, what’s that supposed to mean? ♪ Are we the cushioning~?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Makoto smile %}
Cushioning! I like that! ♪ Let’s also be the lubricating oil while we’re at it! ♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mao smileconfident %}
Right, it’s settled then. After class, I’ll join you guys, then we’ll go and ask Sakuma-senpai about what happened afterwards.

Until then, make sure to do your best in class, Takamine. ♪

{% bubble Mao %}
—And that’s how I ended up joining you guys.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Rei grin %}
Kukuku. I’m delighted to know that Isara-kun is also interested in this painting. ♪

Take a close look. This is the painting that is said to “make one drop dead upon gazing at it three times”. ♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mao awkward %}
Ah~ I’m sorry… I already heard about that being a lie.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Rei surprised %}
What…!?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Rei sightired %}
Ah, a pity… I wanted to see you tremble in fear over a curse.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mao serious %}
Why would you try to do something strange like that anyway? Did you really want to scare me that much?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Rei %}
Indeed I did. It would be in poor taste to only frighten Takamine-kun, and I wanted to see how you’d react, as well.

And if you are the type to show interest in curses, then I could invite you to be a new member of the Mystery Researchers Club.

Well, no matter. You’d like to know what happened to this painting, correct?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Rei yare %}
I called the artist’s family afterwards, but it seems that they do not want any strangers visiting him while he is in poor health.

Even a request to hear my part of the story was promptly declined.

With how they spoke, they might have assumed me to be a distant relative who is attempting to take part of his inheritance.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mao northinking %}
True, to an outsider, you’d definitely be seen as someone aiming for his inheritance.

If I got a phone call telling me that they have an old painting and want me to hear them out, I’d be on my guard too.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Rei serious %}
Mm. Indeed so.

At any rate, since neither the artist in question nor his family will hear us out, we likely have no choice but to investigate the surrounding area.

I am the first person to suggest this investigation, so I plan to take responsibility and will conduct one tomorrow, too. If the three of you are interested, I would be most grateful if you would assist me.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Mao smile %}
Of course. I finished passing on everything to the Student Council, so I’ve got a bit of free time. This whole thing’s actually perfect timing for me, if anything.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Makoto norsmile %}
I’ll also help out. Having a mystery presented to me without finding out the truth… just doesn’t feel satisfying to me.

Right, Takamine-kun?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Midori norsmile2 %}
Yeah. I’ve come this far already, so leaving the rest up to my seniors doesn’t feel right.

Plus, I’m now even more curious to learn the truth behind this painting, so…

I’ll help out if it’s for a short while.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Rei smilesoft %}
Then it’s settled. Tomorrow, we will split in pairs and conduct a survey on anyone concerned with the artist, as well as investigate the region.

We shall decide the pairs through a drawn lottery. How does that sound, gentlemen?
