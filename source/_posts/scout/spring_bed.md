Ahhh, that's a relief… Jeez, you really had me worried there, y'know?

Stop being so reckless, Anzu! You're not "the only Producer" like you were before, okay? If you're getting worn out, then ask someone else to help you out, got it?

We've just found a new trajectory with BIGBANG, and I know a lot of the other units are starting to get on their feet with their own things too.

Everyone who's been touched by you, Anzu, is really doing well.

You oughta be able to relax now, okay? That's why you're banned from working until you're the picture of perfect health!

…Eichi-senpai said the same thing?

Ahaha, that's 'cause you're loved, Anzu.

I ran over here the minute I heard you were hospitalized, and there were *already* get-well gifts here before me. What comes around, goes around, y'know?

Are these candies? Yakiniku-flavored potato chips, huh… Sounds like the kinda thing a guy'd bring. ♪ Is this can of black tea from Eichi-senpai?

Oooh, what's that? It's all glittery! ♪

Ah, so it's a kind of herbarium![^1] There's flowers inside and it's super sparkly, so whoever gave you this sure has taste. ♪

Huuh, so they're nemophila flowers… Each flower's got its own meaning, so it's pretty interesting…?

And this one's "I forgive you"…?

Mm~, what's *that* supposed to mean…? I feel like that's really weird somehow… Hey, who'd you hear it from?

A secret? Tch, you won't even drop me a hint?

Well, that's fine. You've got your own friends too, people I don't *have* to know. Actually, it's not weird at all, since you've been surrounded by nothing but guys 'til now.

You're taking classes with other students in the Producer Course, right?

It covers stuff like planning projects, making clothes and music, all kinds of stuff… You're a total pro after last year, so I bet you've got a lot of advice to give.

So everything you got in the Idol Course is really being put to use now, huh? Gotcha gotcha, I'm happy that I helped out, too.

Ahaha, I bet they're relying on you a ton 'cause you're a vet in the area. Feels like it's super different than the kind of trouble you'd get up to in Idol Course~♪

What about us? It definitely feels like all the underclassmen are doing is asking us about a lot of things. Since we won the SS and all, I guess you could say they've got a deep appreciation for our experience.

But I've at least got the chance to talk to older idols at ES's agencies, so I guess you've got it harder than me.

We've been able to show off just how unpredictable we can be with BIGBANG, and there's only more to come.

…Oh, whoops! It's been a good talk, Anzu, but it's bad to interrupt your rest like this. I really, really wanna hear more about how your life's been lately, but I'll leave you alone so you can get your Zs in today.

Here's my get-well gift to you! It's a super sparkly, super shiny coin!

I was in a hurry, so I didn't get to really *choose*-choose something for you, so I just grabbed my favorite coin out of my collection!

I always get super pumped looking at it, so I'd be super happy for you to have it!

I'll check on you later, Anzu! Make sure you eat tons and sleep a lot during your break, okay~?

Trickstar's running right beside you in the same race, so let's take on some work together sometime! ♪

…………

Man, I'm glad Anzu's safe and sound.

But still… "I forgive you" — what the hell’s *that* supposed to mean?

Man, I really feel like I messed up with that gift I got her now…

I thought it was fine when I was first rushin' over after hearin' that she was gettin' put in the hospital…

But I shoulda gotten Big Sis Anzu somethin' that fit her more, like flowers or somethin'…

Instead, ‘cause I heard about it so suddenly, I grabbed somethin' I usually eat an' called it a day… I should've gotten her somethin' girlier…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Subaru %}
Huh, you came too, Tetora? Didja get Anzu a get-well gift?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora %}
Yeah, 'course. I was actually headin' to meet with her for some plannin' stuff when I got told she'd been hospitalized, so I rushed on over.

We were supposed to be goin' over some stuff for Ryuseitai-N, but I didn't think she'd be checked in with a fever…

Seein' the state of her, I seriously feel awful askin' for her help.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Subaru %}
Yeah? Then the yakiniku potato chips she had were from you?

{% bubble Tetora %}
Ahaha, yeah… What a total waste of a get-well gift, huh~? I'm regrettin' it.

{% endbubble %}

The jar that's got flowers inside!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora %}
Oh, so *that's* what that thing's called? It was already there when I came by.

Big Sis got put in the hospital for a fever this mornin', so maybe they're from someone who heard 'bout it then an' there?

{% bubble Subaru %}
Hmmm, so she got it from someone who came before you, huh…
{% endbubble %}

I'm so not followin', what's up?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Subaru %}
I dunno really, it's just… There's something weird about it. The herbarium's full of nemophila flowers, but I'm kinda bothered by the meaning they've got.

When I looked 'em up on my phone, it said they had the meaning of stuff like "success" and "loveliness", but the meaning that Anzu gave me felt like there was a lot more goin' on with it. She said they meant "I forgive you".

And on top of that, she was way quieter than usual.

I kept wondering if maybe Anzu'd made a mistake and was bothered by it or something.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora %}
Gotcha. So you were wondering if I was the person who gave it to her, huh?

Nah, no way. I'm deffo not good enough with flowers to give her something like that~. I'm more the type to give somethin' more nourishing.

{% bubble Subaru %}
For reals~. I almost brought her some food myself!

Still, if you didn't bring her the herbarium, then who *did*? Did you see anyone else come by?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora %}
Sorry, but that's gonna be a no from me. I didn't pass by anyone else or anything.

Though if we're talkin' flowers, maybe it was Hajime-kun? He's always takin' care of the gardens, so he's the first person that comes to mind when thinkin' of who could've given them to her.

You an' him are pretty close, aren'tcha Akehoshi-senpai? Why don'tcha ask him if he's the one who gave them to her?

*Love*?

Oh, nah, it's nothing like that. I'm just worried about her~.

Last year, me and Anzu were tighter than two peas in a pod. Of *course* I’m gonna get worried if we get distant all of a sudden.

I'm certain you remember that I have my fingers in many PIES, Baru-kun.

I happened to learn the reasons why she would receive them while spreading the gospel of how the Five Eccentrics raised Yumenosaki to greater HEIGHTS, you SEE.

Due to that, I was able to have the Little Kitten confess what shadowed her heart so as WELL.

Confessed, huh… Did she do something unforgivable?

{% bubble Natsume %}
What is and is not forgivable is a matter of subjectiviTY. I haven't the right to judge THAT.

Not realLY. I was only passing by, after ALL.

…Well, I suppose it's FINE. You don't seem as if you'll be able to solve this on your OWN, so I shall give you a HINT.

The Little Kitten is the victim in this CASE, so when considering the meaning of the flowER, think of it in reVERSE.

Tch~, you know the answer, but you're not gonna tell me 'cause you're stingy, huh?

Well, whatever. I wouldn’t want to spill her secrets either, so if Anzu asked you not to say anything then I won't either.

{% bubble Subaru %}
Really…?

{% bubble Tetora %}
Whoo! Then these snacks are ours for the takin', Hajime-kun!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Hajime %}
Heehee. Thank you very much…♪

But why *did* you start up a word game with plants out of the blue like that, Akehoshi-senpai?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Subaru %}
I've just been overthinkin' a lot of things lately and gettin' kinda bogged down by them… so I guess I thought this might be a good starting point in figuring things out.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Hajime %}
Well, thinking about one thing over and over again *can* be tiring.

But with such a lack of leads, I'm at my wits' end too.

I even tried asking about it around school, but I didn't get anything.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora %}
Yeah. I tried askin' someone at the hospital about what was goin' on, but they're so tight-lipped about stuff like that I pretty much got turned away at the door…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Hajime %}
If only we had some kind of breakthrough…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Subaru %}
Hey, Shinonon? Do you know what the opposite of the meaning of nemophilas is?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Hajime %}
The… *opposite*?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Subaru %}
Yeah. I bumped into Natsume a little bit ago, and he said that they had the opposite meaning.

It seems like he's got some idea of what's goin' on, but he wouldn't tell me anything specific. So it's been putting my head in a spin since then.

"I forgive you"… Even if it's supposed to be the opposite like he said, I still don't get it.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora %}
Well, the opposite of "I forgive you" would be "I won't forgive you", right?

That sounds like somethin' an evil organization might do… Goin' out of their way to visit her, just to say "I'll never forgive you for this"…! That's some pretty scary stuff.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Subaru %}
You mean they might've given her the nemophila flower as a dig at her?

I mean, that's super dark. But I guess that'd explain why Anzu couldn't tell us the truth.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Hajime %}
That *does* make sense, doesn't it? Anzu-san happened to incur someone's wrath somehow, and it was ultimately settled by Sagami-sensei once he found out…

But if that was the case, why would she keep such a terrible gift on display?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Subaru %}
Huh… Then Natsume's words about the "opposite" might mean something else?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora %}
Then the opposite of "I forgive you" could be something like… "Forgive me"!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Subaru %}
But that's something they could just say themselves, right? There'd be no need to give her a flower asking for it instead.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora %}
In that case… What other kinds of "opposite meanings" are there?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Subaru %}
I dunno either. Opposite, opposite…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Hajime %}
Ah. I think I've got it.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Subaru %}
For reals?!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Hajime %}
Yes. Just as Sakasaki-senpai said, it's the opposite meaning.

In other words, this "I forgive you" doesn't mean that what happened was something bad that couldn't be forgiven– no, how do I put it…

It's based in jealousy and hate. They want to move forward positively by making peace with their negative feelings.

I think that, by "forgiving her", they're owning up to their regret and wish to make amends – to be friends with her.[^2]
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Subaru %}
Huh… It's a little complicated, but I get what you're saying.

The person who came by to check on her's real prickly, huh?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Hajime %}
Yes, probably…♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora %}
But how'd you come up with that train of thought? It ain't somethin' you'd usually think of.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Hajime %}
Ahaha, about that — it's something easy to miss.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora %}
Easy to miss…?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Hajime %}
While you two were talking, I did a little digging on my phone. Would you please turn your attention to this site?

The title itself only says that it's about the language of flowers, but if you read further in, you can see that the meaning itself is a good one.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Subaru %}
So rather than mean it in a bad way… they meant it in a good way?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Hajime %}
That's right. From the start, we were too caught on what profound meaning "I forgive you" might be.

Heehee. Now that I know it's got such a warm meaning, I'm pretty relieved. ♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora %}
For sure. It says here that it's a sort of clumsy, but nice way of askin' to be friends from here on out.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Subaru %}
Then we were really just stickin' our noses where they didn't belong, huh. Man, I've really done Anzu wrong…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Hajime %}
Ah, I don't think you've done anything wrong, Akehoshi-senpai.

I do think there was someone who might've hated Anzu-san, even if it was just for a time.

But if the message meant for her got out, it might have spoiled their intentions behind it. Is it any wonder that Anzu-san wanted to keep it a secret?

I'm sure the reason you noticed something, Akehoshi-senpai, is because you're always watching her.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Subaru %}
Shinonon…

Thanks. I'll go and visit Anzu tomorrow.

To apologize to her, and… to talk to her, too.
{% endbubble %}

## Chapter 7

<div class="msr-location">
    <p><span><b>Location:</b> Private Hospital Room</span></p>
</div>

{% img Spring Bed 7 - 1.png %}

{% bubble Natsume %}
Hello THERE, Little Kitten. How are you feeLING?

I SEE. So you're well enough to be released tomorROW. Do you feel well-resTED?

That's good THEN. Without you aROUND, it has been difficult to get more challenging plans put into PLAY, so I'm truly looking forward to your reTURN.

ALSO… There are others than mySELF, and the other idols that you KNOW, who are worried about YOU. The girl who gave you the herbariUM, for examPLE.

"I forgive you" — It's so very like YOU, Little Kitten, to sincerely accept a flower filled with previous hostiliTY.

That is why you were at the flower BEDS, isn't IT? You sought to figure out how best to befriend her in your own WAY.

HowEVER, I believe you've been rather careless as WELL.

You were the sole Producer who had ever been part of the Idol Course as part of a trial RUN…

Having gone through such special circumstanCES, you were the object of envy for those who had just entered the newly appointed Production COURSE.

You might have been saved if you HAD, in this situaTION, a name that was reverED, such as the Five Eccentrics. But you did NOT.

You are like any other nameless ProduCER, and it is due to the pride you have in yourself that gave those around you the wrong IDEA.

You are LUCKY, Little Kitten, that that girl changed her ways once you became hospitaLIZED… but if things continued to worSEN, the teachers may have had to interVENE, you KNOW?
{% endbubble %}

{% img Spring Bed 7 - 2.png %}

{% bubble Natsume %}
《Please, treasure yourself more.》

..I'm sorRY. I hadn't meant to criticize you SO.

HowEVER, seeing your self-sacrifice reminded me of something long AGO.

As you KNOW, I am working to have the Five Eccentrics remembered eternally in YumenosaKI.

I spoke to you about this previousLY, but I believe that after THIS, we must push it harder than EVER.

If the merits of the past are left unspoKEN, they will be forgotTEN.

That goes for your own influential efforts TOO. While older students in the Idol Course know them WELL, newer stuDENTS, as well those who come in through the Production COURSE, haven't the faintest IDEA.

You were given special treatment by being allowed into the course a year ahead of everyone ELSE — or so it has been SAID, what was once a simple myth turned into vulGAR, common GOSSIP.

There's little meaning in them trying to assess the values of the past with their current understanding of THINGS.

Due to their great POWER, a hero who achieves a revolution is feared to be the next Big Bad to be defeaTED.

Baru-kun was worried about you as WELL, you KNOW, after seeing your dispirited FACE.

He seemed utterly distresSED, but while I gave him a little nudge in regards to the flower's meanING… I do wonder if he ever managed to figure out the TRUTH?

HM? You don't want me helping as I PLEASE?

You were hesitating on whether or not you should tell Baru-kun the truth yourSELF, were you NOT? I only meddled a little BIT.

"If you give me a splendid answer worthy of IT, I shall tell you the TRUTH" — that isn't such a bad THING, now is IT?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Subaru %}
Hey, are you there, Anzu~?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Natsume %}
MY, MY. It would seem the star of the show has arriVED, just as we were speaking of HIM.

Well THEN, I'll leave you to IT. Being that it is Baru-kun, I'm certain he has solved the mystery of the nemophila flower’s meanING.

Get well SOON, Little Kitten.

…You may come IN, Baru-kun.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Subaru %}
Oh, you're here too, Natsume?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Natsume %}
YES. HowEVER, I was just taking my LEAVE.

And once you two are ALONE, you should talk about what needs to be talked ABOUT.

As well as the mystery of the nemophila flower’s meanING.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Subaru %}
…Yeah.

See you later, Natsume.
{% endbubble %}

{% img Spring Bed 7 - 3.png %}

{% bubble Subaru %}
Alrighty then, I'm up to bat! Let's get ourselves all caught up. We haven't really been able to talk lately, huh? About what's going on with us lately, or what kinda plans we've got coming up… Any of it.

It's seriously been a helluva few months, huh~. Starting our last year of school, getting into a new agency… It's no wonder we've drifted apart a bit, huh?

…I'm kinda embarrassed to just be all like "Let's talk!" and stuff after so long though, but…

Hm? You kept meaning to talk to me too, Anzu? Good, I'm glad!

But yeah, I was looking into the nemophila flower meaning thing… More than anything else though, I wanted to know how you were doing.

Let's talk about everything, every last bit.

You don't gotta hold back anything, Anzu. That's how we are, right?

All the time we've spent together, the trust we built up 'til now — that stuff's not goin' away. All we've gotta do is dust off that ol' box of memories and we'll be right back where we left off. ♪

♪\~♪\~

Man, what's takin' her so long? I wanna celebrate Anzu's release from the hospital already~!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora %}
You sure are in a good mood, Akehoshi-senpai.

So why'd Big Sis get those nemophila flowers anyway? It'd be awesome if it's like we thought an' it was 'cause someone wanted to make friends with her an' all.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Hajime %}
Ah, I wanted to ask about that as well. She’s not sad or anything, is she?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Subaru %}
Nope, she's all good in that area!

Actually, we didn't even really end up talking about the nemophila flower at all, huh~? They weren't really important in the long run anyway.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora %}
Wait, for real?! What d'you mean by *that*?!

You spent all this time caught on what it could mean, an' you didn't even end up *talkin' about it*?!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Subaru %}
*Heh heh heh*. It's me and Anzu's secret. ♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora %}
Th-That's no fair! We helped too, so we oughta know *somethin*' about it!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Hajime %}
That's right~. I’m curious to know too.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Subaru %}
Ahaha, you can get the full story later. ♪ I'm not like, trying to hide it from you guys or anything like that, but I'd rather Anzu tell you about it so there's no misunderstandin'!

She didn't wanna worry any of us, see. That's why it felt like there was a serious mystery going on!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora %}
Huh, 'kay… Then what *did* you guys talk about? Like, it wasn't small talk stuff about how the weather was farin' and all, right?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Subaru %}
Well~, actually, I kinda think that sorta chit chat was exactly what we needed?

The nemophila flower language thing's just what got me moving. 'Cause of them, I noticed something was up with Anzu, and I actually got to talk to her for the first time since the new year started.

We're both in new positions, so we ended up kinda holding back from each other.

But thanks to the mystery of flower meanings, I feel like me and Anzu talked, like *really talked*, for the first time in a long time.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora %}
Ahaha. So me an' Hajime-kun's efforts weren't goin' to waste, huh?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Hajime %}
That's right. By putting our heads together, the three of us solved the riddle. ♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Subaru %}
Bingo! Seriously, thanks a lot for helping me out, even if I just kinda dragged you guys along.

Oh, right! Thanks a bunch for those potato chips you brought Anzu before, Tetora!

They were so good, once I popped I just couldn't stop! ♪
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora %}
Wait, are you for real?! Those were for Big Sis, y'know?! Don't eat other people's gifts just 'cause you can!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Subaru %}
I'm sorry, okay~? You can give her another one to celebrate her getting out of the hospital, so lemme have this!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora %}
You can’t just let yourself off like that! Even if you apologize now, that doesn't change the fact you took the gift I got her!

…Ah– how long've you been watchin' us, Big Sis Anzu?!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Hajime %}
Heehee. Congratulations on your release, Anzu-san. We came to meet you.

We wanted to celebrate it, and also apologize for prying into your private life — would you like to join us for lunch?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora %}
That's right, the first thing you oughta do is get your energy back with a good meal!

It probably ain’t the best idea to get some yakiniku for lunch, huh? But If you're lookin' to bust your belt, I've got a couple of other places I can rec ya! ♪

So, where do you wanna get some grub, Big Sis?

…? What're you starin' so hard at your phone for? Are you lookin' to see what you'd like?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Hajime %}
After talking to Akehoshi-senpai yesterday, you realized something you wanted to show us…?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Subaru %}
Really? What is it? …"Introducing: The Nemophila Flower"?

This is the site I was looking at before, too. Uh, you want me to take another look at the flower meanings?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Hajime %}
It means "success", "endearing", and "I forgive you"…
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Subaru %}
The girl who gave her those flowers said they meant the last one, but maybe she also meant the others too…?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Hajime %}
Oh, now that you mention it, I see what you mean. Looking at all of them like this, I really feel as if each one represents you, Anzu-san.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora %}
Success, huh… If it's Big Sis handlin' things, then there's no way it's gonna flop!
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Hajime %}
And on top of that, perhaps that girl also saw Anzu-san as someone you'd call endearing.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Subaru %}
Yeah, but… maybe that's why that girl couldn't forgive her.

It's like Anzu's got everything she doesn't, so she's jealous–

Ahaha, she really *is* a contrarian! That girl sure used a roundabout gift to tell Anzu her true feelings.

…Well, guess I'm the same way. It's pretty hard to speak from the heart, you know?

I've been told that I'm a blunt kinda guy, but when I'm around Anzu, I get weirdly conscious of what I'm saying.

Maybe I'm like, more concerned about how Anzu and I's positions have changed than I thought I was.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Tetora %}
Yeah, I get what you mean exactly!

Ever since I started gettin' juniors of my own, I've been havin' a tough time figurin' out what's real an' what's a face I'm putting out there.

From bein' someone who looked up to others to bein' the one looked up *to*… I’ve still got a lot to learn.
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Hajime %}
Me too. I feel like things've changed ever since Nii~chan graduated.

He used to do everything for us, and now, we're the ones who're doing everything for ourselves.

Accepting change, but still not forgetting what you hold dear — even if you understand that logically, it's difficult, isn't it?
{% endbubble %}

{% bubble Subaru %}
Yeah, it is. It's like… Even if a new season brings new flowers that bloom, the feeling of seeing beautiful flowers never fades. ♪

Hey, Anzu. Even if our positions might be different now, our bond won't ever change, you know?
{% endbubble %}

{% img Spring Bed 8 - 2.png %}

{% bubble Subaru %}
That's why we could face each other this time, too.

…Heheh. Alrighty, let's get to celebrating!

When idols like us and producers like you team up, any time's a good time! ♪

From here on out, let's keep doing fun things together! Whether it's work-related, just stuff at school, or any other fun events that come our way!

Without hesitation, with everything we've got — that's how we are, so let's keep our friendship burning strong!

## Translation Notes

[^1]: They're adorable little bottles popular in Japan. More info [https://sendai-experience.com/en/ex/22 here].
[^2]: This is a reference to Buddhist forgiveness, which in essence boils down to one forgiving another so that they may move on from their current situation; the student in question doesn't want to be trapped by her feelings of jealousy and anger anymore, and therefore forgives Anzu for making her feel that way. It's not a method those in the western world are familiar with, which is why it might come off oddly for Anzu to accept the girl's forgiveness in lieu of an actual apology for what happened, but this is in accordance with what cultures that practice Buddhism are familiar with. More information on forgiveness in Buddhism can be found [https://jackkornfield.com/the-practice-of-forgiveness/ here].
