## Introduction
{% img /img/banner/about.jpg %}

Heya, this is 310mc's Translation site! In here, I'll be posting my unofficial JP→ENG translations for any series I'm interested in. I also JP proofread for translators, mainly in Ensemble Stars (Enstars) ♪

Be sure to check my <a href="/translations/" target="_blank">translation masterlist</a>, <a href="/categories/" target="_blank">categories</a>, or <a href="/tags/" target="_blank">tags</a> to navigate the site!

You can also contact me anytime on <a href="https://twitter.com/310mc1" target="_blank">twitter</a>.

**※ Everything on this site is unofficial and for non-profit.**

### Translation Bias

I'm most likely to translate the following content:

**Ensemble Stars**
1. Midori-related stories
2. Chiaki-related stories
3. Ryuseitai-related stories

<!--**Helios Rising Heroes**
1. Will-related stories
2. South Sector-related stories-->
