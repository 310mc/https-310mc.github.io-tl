Heya, this is 310mc's Translation site! In here are my unofficial JP→ENG translations for Ensemble Stars. I also JP proofread for Enstars translators ♪

Be sure to check my <a href="/translations/" target="_blank">translation masterlist</a>, <a href="/categories/" target="_blank">categories</a>, or <a href="/tags/" target="_blank">tags</a> to navigate the site!

You can also contact me anytime on <a href="https://twitter.com/310mc1" target="_blank">twitter</a>.

**※ Everything on this site is unofficial and non-profit.**

### Translation Bias

I'm most likely to translate the following content:

1. Midori-related stories
2. Chiaki-related stories
3. Ryuseitai-related stories

<!--**Helios Rising Heroes**
1. Will-related stories
2. South Sector-related stories-->
