## Introduction
{% img /img/banner/about.jpg %}

Heya, this is 310mc's Translation site! In here, I'll be posting my unofficial JP→ENG translations for any series I'm interested in. I also JP proofread for translators, mainly in Ensemble Stars (Enstars) ♪

Be sure to check my [translation masterlist](/translations/), [categories](/categories/), or [tags](/tags/) to navigate the site!

You can also contact me anytime on [twitter](https://twitter.com/310mc1).

**※ Everything on this site is unofficial and for non-profit.**

### Translation Bias

I'm most likely to translate the following content:

**Ensemble Stars**
1. Midori-related stories
2. Chiaki-related stories
3. Ryuseitai-related stories

**Helios Rising Heroes**
1. Will-related stories
2. South Sector-related stories
