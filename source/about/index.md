## Introduction
{% img /img/banner/about.jpg %}

Heya, this is 310mc's Translation site! In here, I'll be posting my unofficial JP→ENG translations for any series I'm interested in. I also JP proofread for translators, mainly in Enstars♪

Be sure to check my [categories](/categories/) and [tags](/tags/) to navigate the site! You can also contact me anytime on [twitter](https://twitter.com/310mc1).

**※ Everything on this site is unofficial and for non-profit.**

### Translation Bias

I'm most likely to translate the following content:

**Ensemble Stars**
1. Midori-related stories
2. Chiaki-related stories
3. Ryuseitai-related stories

**Helios Rising Heroes**
1. Will-related stories
2. South Sector-related stories

### Translation Status

* Currently working on uploading my previous translations to this site.

## About 310mc's Translations

**These are my personal preferences. Other translators may differ from the following, so please respect each of their wishes.**

**I permit:**

※ Re-translating my translations into a different language. I'd love it if you could give me a heads up in DMs on [twitter](https://twitter.com/310mc1), though!
※ Linking my translations in directories, etc. This means you're free to copy the URL of a translation and link it on a page.
※ Using my translations in quotebots. You don't have to credit me unless you prefer to.
※ Adjusting my translations in quotebots for any of the following reasons:
1. Changing the speech quirk for consistency/preference
2. Adjusting pronouns to name, or name to pronoun for clarification
3. Changing nicknames/namings for consistency/preference
4. Adjusting grammar or punctuation for clarification

I do **NOT** permit changing the original intent/script of my translations for quotebots. That would simply be a mistranslation, and I don't approve of that.

**I do not permit:**

※ Profiting off of my translations in any way. I don't do my unofficial translations for profit and I would like them to stay as **non-profit**. Please keep in mind that **unofficial translations are typically illegal** and this would cause legal repercussions on both parties.

If you need any clarification, please DM me on [twitter](https://twitter.com/310mc1)!

## Reporting Mistakes

Please feel free to let me know by DMing me on [twitter](https://twitter.com/310mc1)! I'd be happy to know of any problems in my translations or website. Thank you!

HUGEST thank you to [Ren](https://watatomo.github.io/tl/) who customized this *ENTIRE* site's code to be used for Enstars translators.
