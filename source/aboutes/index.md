Ensemble Stars is an idol-training game that originally released in 2015 as *Ensemble Stars!*. The player (Known as *Anzu*) was introduced to Yumenosaki Private Academy, which hosts an all-male idol training course.

However, in 2020, the game began a new era in the universe called *Ensemble Stars!!*. Once the *Ensemble Stars!* school year ended, the *Ensemble Stars!!* era began. New idols were added to the game, and both students and graduated idols join an entertainment agency aggregate known as Ensemble Square.
