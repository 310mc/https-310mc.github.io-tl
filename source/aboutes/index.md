Ensemble Stars is an idol-training game that originally released in 2015 as *Ensemble Stars!*. The player (Known as *Anzu*) was introduced to Yumenosaki Private Academy, which hosts an all-male idol training course.

However, in 2020, the game began a new era in the universe called *Ensemble Stars!!*. Once the *Ensemble Stars!* school year ended, the *Ensemble Stars!!* era began. New idols were added to the game, and both students and graduated idols join an entertainment agency aggregate known as Ensemble Square.

Since the lore of Ensemble Stars runs deep, translation posts are categorized as either ES! Era (During Yumenosaki Academy time), and ES!! Era (During Ensemble Square time) to differentiate between the two.
